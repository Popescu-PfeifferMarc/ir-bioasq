Genetic and biochemical evidence support a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mitosis. In contrast, there has been a long-standing debate as to whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are required for oocyte meiosis. Here, we show that cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sup>2+</sup>

Before these oocytes become fertilization competent, they undergo a so-called &#x0201c;oocyte maturation&#x0201d; period during which they acquire the ability to activate in response to sperm entry, and to support the early stages of embryonic development (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yamashita et al., 2000</xref>). During maturation, oocytes progress through meiosis and arrest at metaphase of meiosis II until fertilization.</p><p>
<italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte maturation provides a valuable model to elucidate the signal transduction cascade mediating meiosis entry and progression. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, oocyte maturation is triggered by the hormone progesterone, which binds to a cell surface receptor and not the classical nuclear receptor/transcription factor. Progesterone leads to inhibition of cAMP-dependent PKA and translation of the proto-oncogene c-Mos, which induces the MAPK cascade culminating in the activation of maturation promoting factor (MPF; for review see <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Nebreda and Ferby, 2000</xref>). MPF is the central kinase that regulates meiotic progression, and consists of a catalytic p34<sup>cdc2</sup> serine/threonine kinase subunit (Cdk 1), and a regulatory cyclin B subunit (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Coleman and Dunphy, 1994</xref>). MPF is also activated by the removal of inhibitory phosphorylations by the Cdc25C phosphatase, which is induced by the polo-like kinase cascade (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Nebreda and Ferby, 2000</xref>).</p><p>A variety of genetic and biochemical evidence support a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and its downstream effectors CaM and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM&#x02013;dependent protein kinase II, in mitosis initiation and progression (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Means, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Whitaker, 1995</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are required for nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), and chromosome condensation during mitosis (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Steinhardt and Alderton, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Twigg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Tombes et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Ciapa et al., 1994</xref>). Furthermore, the cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub>) rise observed at fertilization is the universal signal for egg activation in all species investigated (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Stricker, 2000</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at fertilization release the metaphase II arrest by activating proteolytic degradation of cytostatic factor, thus inducing completion of meiosis II and entry into the mitotic cell cycle (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tunquist and Maller, 2003</xref>). In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release at fertilization induces both the fast and slow blocks to polyspermy in <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Machaca et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast to the well-defined roles for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in mitosis and after fertilization, the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during oocyte maturation remains contentious.</p><p>There has been a long-standing debate in the literature as to whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are required for <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte maturation/meiosis (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Duesbery and Masui, 1996</xref>). Early reports argued that a Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> rise is sufficient to induce oocyte maturation (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Wasserman and Masui, 1975</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Moreau et al., 1976</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Schorderet-Slatkine et al., 1976</xref>). Furthermore, oocytes injected with high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers were unable to mature (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Moreau et al., 1976</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Duesbery and Masui, 1996</xref>). However, injection of IP<sub>3</sub>, which induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, did not stimulate meiotic maturation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Picard et al., 1985</xref>). Additional support for a Ca<sup>2+</sup> role in oocyte maturation comes from reports that measured a Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> rise after progesterone addition using <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a tracer, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive electrodes (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">O'Connor et al., 1977</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Moreau et al., 1980</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wasserman et al., 1980</xref>). In contrast, others could not detect Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> changes downstream of progesterone addition using similar techniques (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Robinson, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cork et al., 1987</xref>). A role for CaM in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte maturation has also been postulated (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wasserman and Smith, 1981</xref>) and challenged (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cicirelli and Smith, 1987</xref>). These conflicting reports argue that the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and oocyte maturation is complex.</p><p>We decided to revisit the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during oocyte maturation/meiosis by framing the problem in terms of the spatially distinct sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> signals can be generated either due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (ER) or Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular space. In fact, these two Ca<sup>2+</sup> sources are mechanistically linked through the store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) pathway, which is activated in response to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores depletion. Therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> is regulated by the balance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. By manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> store load and the extent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCE, we show here that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are not required for meiosis entry. On the contrary, high Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> delays meiosis entry. However, in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> signals oocytes arrest in meiosis I, form abnormal spindles, and do not extrude a polar body. Surprisingly, MAPK and MPF kinetics in oocytes deprived of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are normal. We further mapped the site of action of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> on meiosis entry and show that Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> negatively regulates the cell cycle machinery by acting downstream of PKA and upstream of Mos. These data argue that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals regulate the timing of meiosis entry, and that they are required for the completion of meiosis I. The dual role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> revealed by these studies help explain some of the controversy surrounding the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in oocyte maturation, and provides a framework to explore the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling cascades in meiosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Depleting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores accelerates entry into meiosis</title><p>Maturing oocytes in media with different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) does not affect the time course or extent of germinal vesicle (nucleus) breakdown (GVBD; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>)
, which is indicative of meiosis entry. The rate of maturation in the population was quantified as the time required for 50% of the oocytes to undergo GVBD (GVBD<sub>50</sub>). Because the rate and extent of GVBD were unaffected in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (L-Ca) medium, this shows that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is not required for entry into meiosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>

Thapsigargin leads to Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion because of a poorly defined Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak pathway from the ER (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Camello et al., 2002</xref>). Emptying Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCE (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Parekh and Penner, 1997</xref>). Because the extent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCE depends on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the medium, oocytes incubated in high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (H-Ca) medium will have more Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx than those in normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (N-Ca) medium, and no Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in expected in L-Ca medium (see Fig. 4).</p><p>Emptying Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores with either thapsigargin or ionomycin in N-Ca does not affect the time to GVBD<sub>50</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>, Thap-N-Ca and Ion-N-Ca), but decreases maximal levels of GVBD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D, Thap-N-Ca and Ion-N-Ca). In H-Ca, emptying Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores results in high percentage of cellular degeneration due to excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, thus prohibiting analysis of the rate of meiosis entry because GVBD<sub>50</sub> is rarely reached under these conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B, Thap-H-Ca and Ion-H-Ca). In contrast, emptying Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in L-Ca medium accelerates the rate of maturation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>, Thap-L-Ca and Ion-L-Ca), without affecting maximal maturation levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D, Thap-L-Ca and Ion-L-Ca). In L-Ca medium with Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores depleted, oocytes are unable to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals after progesterone addition because Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores are depleted and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is prevented in L-Ca medium (see Fig. 4); nonetheless they enter meiosis at an accelerated rate. These data show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are not required for GVBD and argue that Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> negatively regulates meiosis entry.</p><p>Although Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals after progesterone addition are dispensable for GVBD, it is conceivable that Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> signals generated before progesterone addition are required for meiosis entry. To determine whether this is the case, we depleted Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores with thapsigargin and waited for extended periods of time before inducing maturation with progesterone. We reasoned that if Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are required for GVBD, the longer we wait after depriving oocytes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals the less effective progesterone will be in inducing maturation. Depleting stores for as long as 48 h does not affect the extent of oocyte maturation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F), but still enhances oocyte maturation rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E). These results support the conclusion that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are not required for entry into meiosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Lowering Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> levels accelerates meiosis entry</title><p>The more rapid maturation observed in L-Ca medium when Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores are depleted, argues that Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> negatively regulates meiosis entry. It follows then that buffering Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> at low levels should also accelerate meiosis entry. This is indeed the case as injection of 500 &#x003bc;M 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N,N,N',N'</italic>-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) alone or in combination with thapsigargin in varying orders, results in a more rapid maturation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>)
. BAPTA and thapsigargin treatments accelerate maturation to a similar extent with no significant additive effect. However, the longer the interval between BAPTA injection and progesterone addition the more rapid the maturation rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). In all treatments the extent of maturation was comparable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). Similar results were obtained when BAPTA was injected at 1 mM (unpublished data). These data argue that at resting Ca<sup>2+</sup>

However, at such high BAPTA concentrations we observe significant levels of oocyte degeneration, bringing into question the specificity of this treatment. As shown below, injecting BAPTA at 500 &#x003bc;M effectively buffers Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> transients (Fig. 4). In addition, depleting Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thus depriving oocytes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, does not block GVBD. Furthermore, treating oocytes with the heavy metal chelator TPEN blocks oocyte maturation (unpublished data). Based on these findings, it is possible that high BAPTA concentrations block GVBD in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner, either due to a nonspecific effect of BAPTA, or chelation of other metal ions because BAPTA is a potent chelator of transition metals (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arslan et al., 1985</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>High Ca<sup>2+</sup>

To test whether this is the case we induced different levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCE by depleting Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores with thapsigargin and incubating oocytes with solutions containing 5 mM, 3 mM, 1.5 mM, 0.6 mM, and 50 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> (H-5, H-3, H-1.5, N-Ca, and L-Ca, respectively). Inducing maturation in solutions with different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] has no effect on the rate of oocyte maturation, except for L-Ca medium where maturation rate was more rapid (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>)
. Although this enhancement was more pronounced in this set of experiments, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows a similar tendency toward a more rapid maturation in L-Ca medium. More importantly, after store depletion with thapsigargin, the higher the concentration of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> the slower the rate of maturation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). Furthermore, the extent of maturation was reduced in H-Ca containing solutions (H-5, H-3, and H1.5). At both 3 and 5 mM of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (H-5 and H-3) some cellular degeneration was observed, but at 1.5 mM of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> the oocytes were healthy, but the rate of oocyte maturation was slower. These data show that the higher the level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx the slower the rate of maturation, supporting the conclusion that high Ca<sup>2+</sup>

I<sub>Cl1</sub> is sustained because during Ca<sup>2+</sup> release Ca<sup>2+</sup>

In contrast, during Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx I<sub>Cl,Ca</sub> is activated as a transient current (I<sub>ClT</sub>) only when the +40 mV pulse is preceded by a hyperpolarization step (&#x02212;140 mV) to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, right, traces w&#x02013;z).

(A) Voltage protocol and representative current traces of the I<sub>ca,Cl</sub>. I<sub>Cl1</sub> is a sustained current recorded upon depolarization to +40 mV (trace t), whereas I<sub>ClT</sub> is a transient current detected only when the +40 mV pulse is preceded by a hyperpolarization step to &#x02212;140 mV (traces x&#x02013;z). Note that at high 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at &#x02212;140 mV activates an inward Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current (trace z). The current traces shown are from the control oocyte in B. The time at which each trace was obtained is indicated in B. (B&#x02013;G) Oocytes were incubated in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free Ringer (F-Ca) and treated with ionomycin to release store Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The levels of I<sub>Cl1</sub> induced in response to ionomycin provide a measure of store Ca<sup>2+</sup> load. I<sub>Cl1</sub> (squares) is plotted as the maximal current at the end of the +40 mV pulse as indicated by the arrow in A (left). After store depletion oocytes were sequentially exposed to solutions containing the indicated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration: L (50 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>), N (0.6 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), H1.5 (1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), H3 (3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), and H5 (5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Store depletion activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the SOCE pathway, which activates I<sub>ClT</sub>. I<sub>ClT</sub> (circles) is plotted as the maximal current during the second +40 mV pulse as indicated by the arrow in A (right). B, D, and F show the time course of I<sub>Cl1</sub> and I<sub>ClT</sub> in control, thapsigargin, and BAPTA-treated cells, respectively. The time of solution changes and ionomycin (Ion.) addition are indicated above each panel. C, E, and G show statistical analysis of I<sub>Cl1</sub> and I<sub>ClT</sub>. I<sub>Cl1</sub> levels were significantly different in the three treatments (P &#x02264; 0.0041, <italic>n</italic> = 5&#x02013;7). No I<sub>Cl1</sub> was detected in the thapsigargin treatment indicating complete Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion. For I<sub>ClT</sub> in each panel the asterisks indicate significantly different means: (C) Con, P &#x02264; 0.015, <italic>n</italic> = 5; (E) Thaps, P &#x02264; 0.00012, <italic>n</italic> = 7; (G) BAPTA, P = 0.00022, <italic>n</italic> = 6.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="200309138f4"/></fig><p>To determine store Ca<sup>2+</sup> load in the different treatments, we incubated oocytes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free Ringer (F-Ca), and depleted Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores with ionomycin. Because no Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is possible in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution, the level of I<sub>Cl1</sub> activated in response to ionomycin provides a measure of the extent of store Ca<sup>2+</sup> load (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). After the dissipation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release transient indicated by the return of I<sub>Cl1</sub> to baseline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, squares), oocytes were sequentially exposed to L-Ca, N-Ca, H1.5-Ca, H3-Ca, and H5-Ca to determine the extent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B, D, and F</xref>). This protocol was applied to control untreated oocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B) or to oocytes incubated in thapsigargin to fully deplete Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D), or injected with 500 &#x003bc;M BAPTA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> F). The levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release as indicated by I<sub>Cl1</sub> and the levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as indicated by I<sub>ClT</sub> were quantified in the different treatments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C, E, and G</xref>). In control oocytes ionomycin activates a large I<sub>Cl1</sub>, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores are fully loaded (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, squares; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, Ca Rel.). Ca<sup>2+</sup> release leads to store depletion which activates SOCE. As expected, no I<sub>ClT</sub> is detected in either Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution (F-Ca) or in L-Ca medium (L-Ca) confirming our prediction that at 50 &#x003bc;M of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> no Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx occurs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, circles; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C). Increasing levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (indicated by I<sub>ClT</sub>) are observed in media with increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, circles; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A, right).</p><p>Oocytes treated with thapsigargin did not release Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to ionomycin as no I<sub>Cl1</sub> was activated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D, squares; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E, Ca Rel.), showing that Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores were depleted. Because thapsigargin depletes Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, it activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCE. As for control oocytes no Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is observed in F-Ca or L-Ca solutions, and higher levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, as indicated by I<sub>ClT</sub>, are detected in solutions containing increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> D, circles; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E). Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx levels in thapsigargin-treated cells were similar to those in control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and E</xref>).</p><p>BAPTA injection dramatically reduces both Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (I<sub>Cl1</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (I<sub>ClT</sub>) transients (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, F and G</xref>). Small levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release are observed in BAPTA-injected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> F, squares; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> G, Ca Rel.), indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores still contain Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but that as Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released it is chelated by BAPTA, thus drastically reducing the levels of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> available to activate I<sub>Ca,Cl</sub>. The same is true during the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx phase in different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, F and G</xref>). No Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can be detected in L-Ca solution, and small levels of I<sub>ClT</sub> are observed in N-Ca through H3-Ca. Only H5-Ca produced evident, but small I<sub>ClT</sub> consistently (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> G). This indicates that the primary effect of BAPTA injection is to buffer Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> at low levels. The fact that BAPTA injection enhances the rate of meiosis entry in a similar fashion to store depletion argues that this enhancement is due to a reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> levels. It is noteworthy that Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion has been shown to alter ER protein expression (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Soboloff and Berger, 2002</xref>), however, based on the BAPTA data and the delayed maturation rate with high Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub>, it is unlikely that this is affecting meiosis entry.</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetics of MAPK and MPF activation</title><p>We assayed the rate and extent of oocyte maturation above based on the GVBD time course. GVBD marks entry into meiosis but does not provide any information about meiosis progression. Oocyte maturation is considered complete once oocytes reach metaphase of meiosis II. Although, the data presented so far show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are not required for entry into meiosis, they do not address whether meiosis/oocyte maturation can progress normally in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. To determine whether interfering with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways affects meiosis progression, we tested the activation kinetics of the MAPK-MPF kinase cascade, which regulates meiosis transitions (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Nebreda and Ferby, 2000</xref>). As described above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), treating cells with either thapsigargin or injecting BAPTA accelerates meiosis entry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>
A). In N-Ca medium, MAPK phosphorylation is first detected 2 h before GVBD, peaks at GVBD, and remains high for the remainder of maturation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, N-Ca). MAPK activates with similar kinetics in L-Ca, or after the thapsigargin (Thaps) or BAPTA treatments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). However, consistent with the GVBD time course, MAPK activated 1 h earlier in L-Ca medium and 2 h earlier after thapsigargin or BAPTA treatments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B). These data show that in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals MAPK is induced earlier, but has normal kinetics after GVBD.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>

At each time point as indicated, lysates were assayed for P-MAPK levels using an anti&#x02013;P-MAPK specific antibody, and for MPF levels measured as histone H1 kinase activity. MAPK and MPF assays were performed on the same lysate. For P-MAPK Western blots were also probed for &#x003b1;-tubulin (Tub) to provide a loading control. The time course is divided into two phases: (1) after progesterone addition and (2) after GVBD. The 50 and 37 molecular weight markers are shown on the left of each gel. These data are representative of three similar experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="200309138f5"/></fig><p>MPF activates in a characteristic fashion during oocyte maturation with a sharp peak at GVBD followed by a decline to an intermediate level that is indicative of the meiosis I to meiosis II transition, and rises again as oocytes progress through meiosis II (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, N-Ca). MPF activity in oocytes matured in L-Ca medium follows the same kinetics except that peak MPF activity (GVBD) occurs &#x0223c;1 h earlier than in N-Ca. This is consistent with the MAPK activation kinetics (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> B) and the rate of GVBD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). MPF kinetics in the thapsigargin and BAPTA treatments are normal, except that, as for GVBD and MAPK, MPF activity peaks 2 h earlier than in the N-Ca treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, Thaps and BAPTA). Interestingly, an increase in MPF activity is detected as early as 1 h before GVBD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> C, Thaps and BAPTA, arrows). Such a premature activation of MPF is never observed in N-Ca or L-Ca. Therefore, MAPK and MPF activation kinetics (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>) correlate well with each other and with the rate of GVBD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A), and show that reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> transients leads to premature activation of the MAPK-MPF kinase cascade. This premature activation explains the accelerated maturation rate in treatments that reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> transients. Therefore, Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> modulates meiosis entry by negatively regulating the MAPK-MPF cascade.</p></sec><sec><title>Spindle formation and nuclear maturation</title><p>Kinase data in oocytes deprived of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (Thaps and BAPTA) suggest that in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>

The progression through meiosis was not significantly different between the three treatments which will be discuss as a group. At GVBD a large percentage of these oocytes (&#x02265;57%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) had condensed chromosomes, but the microtubule were still dispersed over a large area. We refer to this stage as early prophase (EP; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A), because eventually these oocytes do progress to the late prophase stage (P) as described for the control group (N-Ca) above (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). However, oocytes matured in L-Ca medium or treated with BAPTA or thapsigargin rarely progress to prometaphase I and never reach metaphase I (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Instead, they form abnormal structures at different rates depending on the treatment as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>. Based on the severity of defects we divided abnormal spindles into three groups: (1) We refer to small and/or slightly disorganized spindles as prometaphase like (PM-L; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). These spindles are the least disorganized and are observed throughout the time period studied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). (2) The second group represents completely disrupted spindles (Ab) with no clear structure and with the microtubules highly condensed and/or spread over a large area. In most but not all instances condensed chromosomes were still associated with the disrupted spindle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A, Ab). (3) The last and most interesting group we refer to as the double spindle (DS) group (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). These double spindles were most common in the L-Ca group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), but were also observed in the thapsigargin treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A, Thaps, DS).</p><p>It is interesting that the highest percentage of disrupted spindles (Ab) in the experimental groups (L-Ca, Thaps, and BAPTA) is observed at 2&#x02013;3 h after GVBD which corresponds to the meiosis I to meiosis II transition in control oocytes. At later time points, spindle structures are improved (PM-L), as if the cells are attempting to go through meiosis II. This is supported by the appearance of DS structures at 3&#x02013;4 h after GVBD arguing that although these oocytes do not progress normally through meiosis I, they attempt to form a meiosis II spindle, that in some cases lead to the observed double-spindle structures. This might be expected with normal MAPK and MPF kinetics past GVBD in all the treatments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), which will drive these cells into meiosis II despite the abnormal progression through meiosis I. The fact that MPF and MAPK kinetics are normal past GVBD in the L-Ca, thapsigargin, and BAPTA treatments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), but that meiotic spindles are disorganized show that interfering with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during meiosis uncouples the MAPK-MPF cascade from spindle structure regulation. Furthermore, these results show that although Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are not required for meiosis entry (GVBD and chromosome condensation), they are necessary for progression through meiosis I and for bipolar spindle formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Polar body emission</title><p>Spindle structure data show that interfering with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling leads to abnormal spindles, arguing that oocytes do not complete meiosis I. To directly confirm this, we assessed polar body emission from 1&#x02013;4 h after GVBD in the different treatments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>). In N-Ca medium, polar bodies were observed in the majority of the cells, but as expected from the spindle structure experiments, oocytes matured in L-Ca medium or treated with thapsigargin or BAPTA rarely extrude a polar body (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). This shows that interfering with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling inhibits the completion of meiosis I.</p><p>The fact that oocytes matured in L-Ca medium had abnormal spindle structure and could not finish meiosis I argues that either Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular space is required during the early stages of oocytes maturation for normal meiosis progression, or that oocytes are unable to form a polar body at low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. To differentiate between these possibilities we assessed polar body emission in oocytes incubated in N-Ca solution until GVBD and then switched to L-Ca solution (N-L); or in oocytes incubated in L-Ca solution until GVBD and then switched to N-Ca medium (L-N). Oocytes in the N-L group, but not the L-N group, emitted polar bodies to the same extent as the N-Ca control group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>), arguing that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the early stages of oocyte maturation is required for meiosis I progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> acts between PKA and Mos to negatively regulate entry into meiosis</title><p>To better define the mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> negatively regulates meiosis entry, we mapped the site of action of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> on the cell cycle machinery using an epistatic approach. For these experiments thapsigargin-treated oocytes represented the experimental group deprived of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Control oocytes were activated in N-Ca solution. Our approach was to activate the cell cycle machinery at different points along the MAPK-MPF signal transduction cascade, and determine whether the enhancing effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> depravation on the rate of maturation is still observed. Oocytes were activated with progesterone, or by injection of an inhibitor of PKA inhibitor (PKI), Mos RNA (Mos), cyclin B1 RNA (Cy) and &#x00394;87cyclin B1 protein (CyP; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>
A). Thapsigargin treatment enhanced the rate of oocyte maturation to a similar extent in oocytes activated with progesterone or PKI (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, PKI). Thapsigargin-treated oocytes activate faster than controls after Mos RNA injection, but the effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> deprivation on the rate of maturation is smaller than in the case of progesterone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, Mos). Because the kinetics of the kinase cascade downstream of Mos are similar in control and thapsigargin-treated oocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), we wondered whether the faster maturation rate in thapsigargin-treated Mos-injected oocytes is due to an effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> deprivation on RNA translation. To determine whether this is the case we induced meiosis by directly activating MPF through the expression of cyclin B1 to activate the free cdc2 pool in the oocyte. Similar to Mos RNA injection, thapsigargin-treated oocytes activated faster than controls after cyclin B1 RNA injection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, Cy). In contrast, injecting oocytes with cyclin B1 protein induces GVBD with a similar time course in both thapsigargin-treated and control oocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, CyP). The rate of oocyte maturation with the different activators is summarized in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B. Because the rate of maturation varies between activators we normalized maturation rate for each activator to the rate of activation in N-Ca (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B) to allow a better visualization of the relative effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> deprivation on maturation. For example, although cyclin B activates maturation faster than Mos (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A), the relative enhancement in the rate of maturation (&#x0223c;20% faster) is similar between the two activators in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B). This argues that the more rapid maturation in oocytes deprived of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals after both Mos and cyclin RNA injections is due to an effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> on translation of the injected RNAs. This conclusion is supported by the fact that control and thapsigargin-treated oocytes mature at similar rates when activated with &#x00394;87cyclin B1 protein. However, the different responses after cyclin RNA or protein injections could be due to an effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> on protein turnover because we injected full-length cyclin B1 RNA and &#x00394;87cyclin B1 protein, which is missing the first 87 aa and is thus nondegradable because it lacks the destruction box (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kumagai and Dunphy, 1995</xref>). Nonetheless, we favor an effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> on RNA translation because maturation is enhanced to a similar level when oocytes are activated with Mos or Cyclin B1, two activators that induce the cell cycle kinase cascade at different points.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>

<italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes contain two pools of cdc2, the catalytic subunit of MPF: the preMPF and the free cdc2 pool. The preMPF pool which is activated at GVBD, contains cdc2 associated with cyclin B. Pre-MPF is kept inactive by phosphorylation on Tyr15 of cdc2 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Nebreda and Ferby, 2000</xref>). The free cdc2 pool is activated after association with B-type cyclins synthesized during meiosis I (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hochegger et al., 2001</xref>). To determine which pool of cdc2 is activated in thapsigargin-treated oocytes we probed Western blots with a phosphospecific antibody against Tyr15 of cdc2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C, P-Y15-cdc2), and determined MPF activity as the H1-kinase activity from p13<sup>suc1</sup> pulldowns (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C, MPF). In both control and thapsigargin-treated oocytes the disappearance of P-Y15 immunoreactivity coincides with an increase in MPF activity indicating that as in control oocytes the preMPF pool is activated in thapsigargin-treated oocytes. Interestingly, a small level of MPF activity is detected at the GVBD<sub>50</sub> time point in thapsigargin-treated oocytes that have not undergone GVBD (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, Thaps, G50 nw), confirming the early activation of MPF before GVBD observed in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.</p><p>These data show that in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>

The molecular steps during this time lag are not known. Our data show that Ca<sup>2+</sup>

<sub>cyt</sub> negatively regulates the activation of the cell cycle machinery by acting on at least two sites between PKA and Mos (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D). One site of action appears to be mRNA translation. Therefore, the level of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> provides a timing mechanism for entry into meiosis by regulating the initiation of the MAPK-MPF cascade downstream of PKA inhibition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D). It is tempting to propose that by acting in this capacity Ca<sup>2+</sup>

<sub>cyt</sub> is required for completion of meiosis I</title><p>Oocytes deprived of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals do not complete meiosis I as they do not extrude a polar body. Rather, they form abnormal spindles early in meiosis I despite normal MAPK and MPF kinetics. This shows that progression through meiosis I requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>, possibly Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx before GVBD because oocytes are dependent on extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> only before GVBD (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). A Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx requirement before GVBD fits nicely with the regulation of SOCE during oocyte maturation because SOCE inactivates at the GVBD stage due to MPF activation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Machaca and Haun, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, others have shown that inhibition of the MAPK cascade (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gross et al., 2000</xref>), down-regulation of MPF (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nakajo et al., 2000</xref>), or inhibition of protein synthesis (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kanki and Donoghue, 1991</xref>) block completion of meiosis I. These treatments lead to a decrease in MPF activity, and induce an interphase-like state that is usually absent between meiosis I and II. In contrast, interfering with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling blocks meiosis I completion, but is not associated with an interphase-like state. Rather, spindle structure is disrupted and polar body formation inhibited, but the chromosomes remain condensed. Furthermore, MPF activity cycles normally with a dip in activity between 1&#x02013;2 h after GVBD, the expected time for meiosis I to meiosis II transition. These data show that disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling uncouples the cell cycle machinery (MAPK-MPF) from nuclear maturation (i.e., bipolar spindle formation and completion of meiosis I).</p><p>It is interesting that the disrupted meiosis I spindle does not activate a spindle checkpoint to arrest the cell cycle. However, there is good evidence against the existence of a meiosis I spindle checkpoint in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Blocking the activity of the APC/C or the checkpoint protein Mad2 does not affect progression through meiosis I (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Peter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Taieb et al., 2001</xref>). This is consistent with our observation of a lack of cell cycle arrest in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals despite disrupted meiosis I spindles.</p><p>Recently, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Castro et al. (2003)</xref> described a similar block of meiosis I after inhibition of Aurora A kinase or its substrate Eg5 (a kinesin-like protein) in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Unfortunately, these authors did not assess spindle morphology, but they show that blocking Aurora A inhibits polar body formation with chromosomes maintaining their condensed state long after GVBD (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Castro et al., 2003</xref>). Members of the Aurora kinase family associate with the spindle and have been shown to be important for both meiosis and mitosis transitions. Therefore, it is possible that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathways somehow modulate Aurora A kinase activity which in turn regulates spindle structure. This possibility remains to be explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in GVBD</title><p>During mitosis NEBD has been shown to be dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Poenie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Steinhardt and Alderton, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Twigg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wilding et al., 1996</xref>), and studies in sea urchin embryos suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> exerts its effect through CaMKII activation (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baitinger et al., 1990</xref>). In contrast, during meiosis GVBD is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent as shown here for <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, and in both mouse (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Carroll and Swann, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Tombes et al., 1992</xref>) and starfish oocytes (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Witchel and Steinhardt, 1990</xref>). One exception to this rule are some bivalve molluscs where GVBD has been shown to require Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Deguchi and Osanai, 1994</xref>), but unlike amphibian and mammalian oocytes, in this case oocyte maturation and GVBD occur after fertilization which invariably induces a Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> rise. Nonetheless, the differential requirement of NEBD on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during meiosis and mitosis is surprising because both NEBD and GVBD require the activation of MPF (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lenart and Ellenberg, 2003</xref>), and it is reasonable to assume that the basic structural properties of the nuclear envelope are similar in mitotic and meiotic cells. It has been argued that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is still required for GVBD but occurs very early or even before the initiation of oocyte maturation in some species (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Tombes et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Homa et al., 1993</xref>). This does not seem to be the case for <italic>Xenopus</italic>, because as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> F, eliminating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals for as long as 48 h before inducing oocyte maturation has no effect on GVBD, strongly arguing that GVBD is Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent. Therefore, the differential requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the breakdown of the nuclear envelope suggests that NEBD and GVBD are mechanistically distinct.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are dispensable for GVBD and chromosome condensation, that Ca<sup>2+</sup>
<sub>cyt</sub> controls the timing of meiosis entry by negatively regulating the initiation of cell cycle machinery, and that N-Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is important for bipolar spindle formation and completion of meiosis I. These results provide a framework to further explore and better define the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling pathways in meiosis and oocyte maturation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Oocyte maturation</title><p>

ZW10 and Rod play an essential role in this checkpoint. We show that in mitotic human cells ZW10 resides in a complex with Rod and Zwilch, whereas another ZW10 partner, Zwint-1, is part of a separate complex of structural kinetochore components including Mis12 and Ndc80&#x02013;Hec1. Zwint-1 is critical for recruiting ZW10 to unattached kinetochores. Depletion from human cells or <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts is used to demonstrate that the ZW10 complex is essential for stable binding of a Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 complex to unattached kinetochores. Thus, ZW10 functions as a linker between the core structural elements of the outer kinetochore and components that catalyze generation of the mitotic checkpoint-derived &#x0201c;stop anaphase&#x0201d; inhibitor.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>G.J.P.L.

The mitotic checkpoint guards against such chromosome loss and aneuploidization by halting mitotic progression whenever as little as a single chromosome is not properly attached to a meiotic (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Li and Nicklas, 1995</xref>) or mitotic spindle (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rieder et al., 1995</xref>; for review see <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cleveland et al., 2003</xref>). The &#x0201c;stop anaphase&#x0201d; checkpoint signal is generated at individual unattached kinetochores, from which it diffuses into the cytoplasm to prevent activation of the anaphase promoting complex that would otherwise initiate anaphase onset and mitotic exit by destroying securin and cyclin B (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Peters, 2002</xref>). The diffusible inhibitory complex is thought to consist of one or more combinations of the mitotic checkpoint proteins BubR1, Bub3, and Mad2 that sequester Cdc20, the obligatory activator of the anaphase promoting complex for recognition of mitotic substrates (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sudakin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fang, 2002</xref>).</p><p>A role in generating this complex has been described for most proteins previously implicated in mitotic checkpoint control. Mad1 is required for the stable kinetochore association of a pool of Mad2 that in turn recruits and activates additional Mad2 molecules (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2004</xref>), and the kinesin-like microtubule motor centromere-associated protein (CENP)-E directly activates BubR1 kinase activity at the unattached kinetochore (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Weaver et al., 2003</xref>). Two additional proteins, Zeste White 10 (ZW10) and Rough Deal (Rod), have been implicated in generating a sustained mitotic checkpoint; however, no molecular function in mitotic checkpoint signaling has thus far been suggested (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2000</xref>). It also remains unclear how any of these checkpoint components are connected to the underlying structural elements of the outer kinetochore.</p><p>ZW10 and Rod were originally identified in screens for mutations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that interfere with the faithful transmission of chromosomes to daughter cells during mitosis (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Karess and Glover, 1989</xref>), but orthologues have been recognized in <italic>C. elegans, A. thaliana, G. gallus, M. musculus</italic>, and humans (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Starr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Okamura et al., 2001</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuroblasts of either mutant display identical phenotypes: anaphase figures with misaligned chromosomes and premature sister chromatid separation in cells treated with microtubule poisons (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Scaerou et al., 1999</xref>). Several additional lines of evidence indicate that ZW10 and Rod function together. A <italic>Drosophila zw10;rod</italic> double mutant has a mitotic phenotype that is indistinguishable from the single mutants (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Scaerou et al., 2001</xref>), and both proteins are found in a single complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and human cells (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Scaerou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, ZW10 localization to kinetochores depends on Rod (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Goldberg, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2000</xref>) and vice versa (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Scaerou et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>ZW10 has been implicated as a binding partner of several other proteins besides Rod. Immuno-purification of ZW10 from fly embryos isolated Zwilch, and a yeast-two-hybrid screen for human proteins that bind ZW10 identified human ZW10-interacting protein 1 (HZwint-1, hereafter referred to as Zwint-1; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Starr et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). ZW10, Rod, and Zwilch are interdependent for kinetochore localization, can be found in a single complex in flies and human cells, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants show identical mitotic phenotypes (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). No <italic>Drosophila</italic> Zwint-1 mutant has thus far been identified, but Zwint-1 is also localized to kinetochores, although it arrives there in prophase, before the arrival of ZW10 in early prometaphase (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Starr et al., 2000</xref>). Another protein found to interact with ZW10 in the yeast-two-hybrid system is p50 dynamitin, a component of the cytoplasmic dynein activator dynactin (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Starr et al., 1998</xref>). ZW10 can be found to interact with dynein weakly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2003</xref>), and ZW10 and Rod relocalization to <italic>Drosophila</italic> spindle microtubules during metaphase depends on functional dynein heavy chain (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wojcik et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>ZW10 and Rod are essential for mitotic checkpoint signaling. Injection of antibodies to human ZW10 and Rod abrogates checkpoint function in human cells treated with nocodazole (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2000</xref>), and <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant <italic>rod</italic> or <italic>zw10</italic> neuroblasts are unable to elicit a checkpoint response induced by misattachment in an <italic>asp</italic> mutant strain or upon a colchicine-induced block in mitotic spindle assembly (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basto et al., 2000</xref>). Screening for mutations in alleles encoding putative chromosome instability genes in human colorectal cancers has recently identified mutations in ZW10, Rod, and Zwilch, hinting at the possibility that deregulation of ZW10 function may contribute to the chromosome instability phenotype of tumor cells (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004b</xref>).</p><p>We now use immunodepletion of the ZW10&#x02013;Rod complex from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and reduction of ZW10 accumulation in mammalian cells to identify ZW10 as a bridge between the structural outer kinetochore&#x02014;through its interaction with Zwint-1&#x02014;and the mitotic checkpoint, where it recruits a stably bound Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 complex to unattached kinetochores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ZW10 and Zwint-1 are part of distinct kinetochore subcomplexes</title><p>To purify native complexes of ZW10 or Zwint-1, cell lines were generated that stably express ZW10 or Zwint-1 fused to the localization and affinity purification (LAP) tag that contains enhanced YFP (EYFP) followed by TEV protease cleavage site and a peptide from S-protein (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2004</xref>).

(Published antibodies to human Zwint-1 [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Starr et al., 2000</xref>] failed to recognize the endogenous gene product by immunoblotting in our hands so the level of Zwint-1<sup>LAPtag</sup> relative to endogenous could not be determined.)</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>

Zwint-1 associated with structural kinetochore components including Mis12, Ndc80&#x02013;HEC1, Spc24, and AF15q14 (the human orthologue of <italic>C. elegans</italic> kinetochore-null-1 (KNL-1), hereafter referred to as KNL-1<sup>AF15q14</sup>), along with additional recently described kinetochore proteins (Q9H410, DC31, and PMF-1; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> d; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Obuse et al., 2004</xref>). ZW10, however, resided in a complex with known interacting partners Rod and Zwilch (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> e; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, Rad50-interactor-1, a protein proposed to bind ZW10 in interphase (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hirose et al., 2004</xref>), was present. So too was a novel, previously hypothetical protein FLJ36666/C19ORF25. Neither Rad50-interactor-1 nor C19ORF25 bound kinetochores when fused to EYFP (unpublished data), however, supporting the likelihood that they are part of an interphase ZW10-containing protein structure.</p><p>Zwint-1 was not found stably associated with our complexes containing ZW10 in the stringent LAPtag purifications. To test whether ZW10 and Zwint-1 interacted transiently or with a weak affinity, Zwint-1<sup>LAPtag</sup> was rapidly immunoprecipitated from mitotically arrested HeLa cells (clone LINT2.8; see Materials and methods) and tested for presence of endogenous ZW10. A small but significant fraction of ZW10 remained associated with Zwint-1 under these conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> a). Recombinant ZW10 also interacts with recombinant Zwint-1, and an association between the two can be found in human cultured cells that express high levels of epitope-tagged versions of both proteins (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004a</xref>). That Zwint-1 is part of the structural kinetochore and binds ZW10 implies that Zwint-1 may recruit ZW10 to mitotic kinetochores. This was tested by reduction of Zwint-1 protein levels by plasmid-based small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression to &#x0223c;15% of Zwint-1 levels in cells transfected with mock siRNA (as indicated using an antibody to GFP for immunoblotting serial dilutions of LINT2.8 cell lysates expressing Zwint-1<sup>LAPtag</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> b). Reduction of endogenous Zwint-1 yielded absence of endogenous ZW10 at kinetochores (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> c). Because Zwint-1 apparently arrives at the kinetochore before ZW10 (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Starr et al., 2000</xref>), and kinetochore localization of ZW10 depends on the presence of its Zwint-1 interaction domain (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004a</xref>), these data reveal a crucial role for Zwint-1 in the recruitment of ZW10 to unattached kinetochores.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>

Knockdown was partial and heterogeneous at 2&#x02013;3 d after transfection (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200411118/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200411118/DC1</ext-link>). Significant reduction of ZW10 levels was apparent 5 d after transfection of HeLa cells, with no detectable levels of ZW10 at unattached mitotic kinetochores in &#x0223c;80% of cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, a and b). Although most cells looked relatively healthy at this time point, a fraction was dying, most likely because they had sufficient knockdown at an earlier time and had undergone multiple divisions in the absence of ZW10 (see below). Phospho-histone H3 levels measured by flow cytometry in cells transfected with control siRNA constructs and treated with nocodazole for 16 h showed a 10-fold elevation in mitotic cells when compared with asynchronously growing cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, c and d</xref>). In contrast, mitotic checkpoint signaling was severely compromised by reduction in ZW10, as shown previously for cells injected with anti-ZW10 antibodies (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2000</xref>), with the ZW10 depleted cell population yielding only a twofold increase in mitotic index (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, c and d</xref>). Similar results were found in cells depleted of Zwint-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, c and d</xref>). Moreover, because &#x0223c;20% of the cells transfected with ZW10 siRNA had residual ZW10 at kinetochores, even this modest increase in mitotic index almost certainly reflected continued mitotic checkpoint signaling in the ZW10-containing proportion of cells and a complete absence of sustained checkpoint signaling in ZW10-depleted cells. ZW10-deficient cells underwent aberrant mitoses, which resulted in cell death after several divisions, as indicated by markedly diminished colony formation in continued presence of ZW10 siRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> e) and aberrant chromosome distribution yielding chromatin bridges and micronuclei (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> f).

The ZW10-interactor Zwint-1 is in a structural kinetochore complex with Ndc80&#x02013;HEC1 and Mis12 that is linked to the inner kinetochore by KNL-1<sup>AF15q14</sup>. The ZW10&#x02013;Rod&#x02013;Zwilch complex associates dynamically with the unattached kinetochore through interaction with Zwint-1, where it regulates kinetochore binding of the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 heterodimer and thus activation of Mad2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="200411118f7"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our efforts here identify the ZW10&#x02013;Rod complex as a bridge whose association with Zwint-1 links Mad1 and Mad2, components that are directly responsible for generating the diffusible &#x0201c;wait anaphase&#x0201d; signal, to a structural, inner kinetochore complex containing Mis12 and KNL-1<sup>AF15q14</sup>, the last of which has been proven essential for kinetochore assembly in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2004</xref>). The presence of a stable complex of these components is supported by earlier affinity enrichments for Mis12 complexes which had linked it to nine other components, including Zwint-1 (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Obuse et al., 2004</xref>). Although a single affinity approach has proposed that a small proportion of two heterochromatin proteins, HP1&#x003b1; and HP1&#x003b3;, are components of one or more Mis12 complexes, it is clear from our double affinity approach that neither of these markers for general heterochromatin is in a stable complex that includes Zwint-1. Like KNL-1<sup>AF15q14</sup> and Mis12, Q9H410/c20orf172 and DC31/DC8 are constitutive kinetochore proteins (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Obuse et al., 2004</xref>) that are part of the inner kinetochore. Assembled onto these structures are the outer kinetochore proteins of the Ndc80&#x02013;HEC1 complex and Zwint-1. Moreover, <italic>C. elegans</italic> KNL-1 has been found to associate with CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> and Mis12 colocalizes at the inner centromere with CENP-A and CENP-C (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Goshima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Obuse et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the Zwint-1&#x02013;containing kinetochore subcomplex spans from the innermost components of the kinetochore across all layers of the centromere. Ultimately, mitosis-specific assembly of Zwint-1 recruits ZW10&#x02013;Rod&#x02013;Zwilch that serve to anchor attachment of Mad1 and Mad2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> f). Although a previous study reported that ZW10&#x02013;Rod inhibition after injection of Rod antibody left Mad1 and Mad2 levels still detectable on mitotic kinetochores (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2000</xref>), it is now clear that removal of ZW10 or Rod inactivates the mitotic checkpoint with essentially no Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 recruited to unattached kinetochores in both <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts and human cells. A requirement of ZW10&#x02013;Rod for Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 recruitment is further supported by genetics in <italic>Drosophila:</italic> GFP-Mad2 no longer attaches at kinetochores of colchicine-treated <italic>rod</italic> or <italic>zw10</italic> mutant neuroblast cells (R. Karess, personal communication).</p><p>Although the ZW10 complex could bind Mad1 or a Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 heterodimer directly, this seems unlikely because Mad1 (as well as the Mad2 directly bound to it) is a stable component of the kinetochore before microtubule attachment (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Howell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2004</xref>), but was not found in the affinity purification of ZW10. Moreover, such a static, scaffold-like function for the ZW10 complex is hard to reconcile with the reported highly dynamic behavior of Rod in syncytial <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Basto et al., 2004</xref>), albeit ZW10 and Rod dynamics have not been investigated in the context of mitotic human cells. More likely, ZW10 may affect Mad1 binding in a number of ways as only one component required for creating the Mad1-binding site(s) at the kinetochore. Ndc80&#x02013;HEC1 was found in a yeast-two-hybrid screen for interactors with human Mad1, and Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 kinetochore localization depends on a functional Ndc80&#x02013;HEC1 complex (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Lluesma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">DeLuca et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">McCleland et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bharadwaj et al., 2004</xref>). No binding between Ndc80&#x02013;HEC1 and Mad1 could be reconstituted in vitro with recombinant proteins (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Lluesma et al., 2002</xref>). Perhaps the interaction found in the yeast-two-hybrid is too unstable to be identified by the assays we have used in vitro, which would support the idea that additional factors are required for establishing such an interaction. The ZW10 complex may fulfill that role. Tandem affinity purification of Mad1 and Ndc80&#x02013;HEC1-associating factors and reconstitution using recombinant proteins or purified subcellular complexes could now directly test this.</p><p>The dependency on ZW10 of BubR1 kinetochore localization differs in frog extracts and HeLa cells. Immunodepletion of the ZW10&#x02013;Rod&#x02013;Zwilch complex from frog extracts may affect an activity required for proper BubR1 kinetochore localization that is unaffected by RNAi of one component (ZW10) in HeLa cells. Alternatively, the frog kinetochore in extracts may behave like an all-or-none system more so than the human kinetochore. It is newly assembled upon addition of the sperm DNA to the extract and may therefore be less mature than that of human mitotic cells. Perhaps ZW10 depletion marginally affects BubR1 localization in human cells, an effect readily detected in the less rigidly structured kinetochores that must assemble and disassembly rapidly in the very short embryonic cell cycles. One way to distinguish between these possibilities is to examine checkpoint status and checkpoint protein localization in frog extracts to which the ZW10 complex, reconstituted from recombinant proteins, was restored, a daunting task that we have not been able to achieve since even though we identified a <italic>Xenopus</italic> Zwilch homologue (GenBank/EMBL/DDBL accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BC070818">BC070818</ext-link>), we have been unsuccessful in identifying full-length XRod.</p><p>Despite linkage of dynein at kinetochores to the ZW10 complex through the dynactin subunit p50 dynamitin, it is unlikely that dynein plays any role in the establishment of mitotic checkpoint signaling by ZW10. Whereas depletion of ZW10 prevents the checkpoint from being activated, inhibition of dynein function chronically activates it: overexpression of p50 dynamitin to disrupt the dynein activator dynactin in vertebrate cells or hypomorphic dynein heavy chain mutants in flies both cause checkpoint-dependent mitotic arrest that is abrogated by mutation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rod (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wojcik et al., 2001</xref>) or injection of antibodies to Mad2 into PtK1 cells (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Howell et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, ZW10 and Rod play a role in establishing checkpoint signaling and this is independent of functional dynein.</p><p>Although mitotic arrest after inhibition of dynein has been explained by the lack of tension between sister centromeres, perhaps due to improper spindle assembly (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gaglio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Merdes et al., 2000</xref>), it seems most likely to us that the probable role for dynein in checkpoint signaling is a role in directly silencing it, through dynein's microtubule-dependent removal of mitotic checkpoint proteins (including the ZW10&#x02013;Rod complex along with Mad1&#x02013;Mad2) from kinetochores after stable microtubule capture (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Howell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wojcik et al., 2001</xref>). This then leads to our proposal (modeled in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> g) that establishment and silencing of mitotic checkpoint signaling at the kinetochore is achieved by linking an activator of the checkpoint (ZW10) with a silencer (dynein) whose inhibitor activity requires microtubule capture. At unattached kinetochores, the ZW10 complex recruits checkpoint components which dynein is unable to remove. Upon bi-oriented attachment, dynein powers their removal from both sister kinetochores, breaking the relatively weak binding between the tightly kinetochore-bound Zwint-1 and Zw10 and with dynein thus pulling the ZW10&#x02013;Rod&#x02013;Zwilch complex poleward with it. Loss of the ZW10 complex and its contribution to tethering the stably bound Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 complex serves to mediate rapid checkpoint signal silencing. Re-recruitment of the ZW10 complex during anaphase A may continue its role as a linker mediating dynein attachment at kinetochores, as poleward movement of chromosomes during anaphase is severely affected in <italic>Drosophila zw10</italic> mutant cells (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Savoian et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sharp et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, recognizing a bi-functional role for the ZW10 complex in recruitment of Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 heterodimers to unattached kinetochores and their removal after attachment, combined with a role as a dynein linker for anaphase chromosome movement, it is clear that compromised function of the complex would be predicted to accelerate chromosome missegregation. Indeed, mutations in all three components of the complex are found in highly aneuploid colorectal cancers (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004b</xref>), implicating disruption of one (or both) roles of this bi-functional complex as likely contributors to generation of aneuploidy in human disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>hZwint-1 cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR using HeLa cell cDNA and ligated into pGEMT-easy (Promega). pLAP-hZwint-1 was created by cloning a SalI&#x02013;EcoRI-cut Zwint-1 PCR fragment from pGEMT-hZwint-1 into XhoI&#x02013;EcoRI-cut pEYFP-LAPtag (pIC58; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2004</xref>). pLAP-hZW10 was created by subcloning a XhoI&#x02013;BamHI fragment from pBS-hZW10 into XhoI-BamHI-cut pEYFP-LAPtag.

Cells were collected and mixed for further purification of native complexes as described previously (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2004</xref>). Mass spectrometry was conducted essentially as described previously (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2002</xref>). The samples were analyzed using a ThermoFinnigan LTQ mass spectrometer using Mudpit with the following gradients of 500 mM ammonium acetate: 10, 25, 35, 50, 65, 80, and 100%. Results were searched by Sequest against an ncbi human-mouse-rat database and filtered with DTA Select.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa cells were grown in DME supplemented with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml pen/strep (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS. Nocodazole was used at 200 ng/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts</title><p>CSF-arrested extracts were prepared from unfertilized <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs as described previously (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murray, 1991</xref>). Checkpoint extracts were prepared from these by a 30-min incubation with &#x0223c;12,000 demembranated sperm nuclei/&#x003bc;l and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml nocodazole (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Murray, 1997</xref>). Exit from CSF arrest was induced by addition of 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. For immunodepletion, 100 &#x003bc;g (anti&#x02013;X-ZW10) or 50 &#x003bc;g (anti&#x02013;X-Rod<sub>COOH</sub>) of affinity-purified antibody or nonimmune rabbit IgG were bound to 100 &#x003bc;l Dynabeads protein A (Dynal). 100 &#x003bc;l CSF egg extract was added for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Immunodepletion of X-BubR1 was done as described previously (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2003</xref>). Checkpoint establishment experiments were done by depleting CSF extract for 1 h before adding sperm and nocodazole, whereas checkpoint maintenance experiments were done by depleting extracts for 1 h after sperm and nocodazole were added. Immunofluorescence with <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts was performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abrieu et al., 2000</xref>), using absence of X-BubR1 signal at kinetochores as a marker for the successful depletion of X-ZW10 or X-Rod. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2003</xref>). Antibodies to X-CENPE (1:200), X-BubR1 (1:1,000), X-Mps1 (1:200), and X-Mad2 (1:200) have been described previously (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abrieu et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2003</xref>). Anti&#x02013;X-CENPA (1:100) was a gift of A. Straight (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), anti&#x02013;X-KCM1 (1:100) was a gift of A. Desai (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, La Jolla, CA), and anti&#x02013;X-Mad1 (1:200) was a gift of R.-H. Chen (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunolocalization</title><p>Images were acquired on a DeltaVision deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision) equipped with a CoolSnap CCD camera (Roper Scientific) at 20&#x000b0;C. z-sections were acquired at 2-&#x003bc;m steps using a 100&#x000d7;, 1.3 NA Olympus U-Planapo objective with 1 &#x000d7; 1 binning and 640 &#x000d7; 640 pixel area. All images are z-stack projections. HeLa cells, grown on poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine&#x02013;coated coverslips, were washed once in MTSB buffer (100 mM Pipes, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 30% glycerol) and preextracted in MTSB/0.5% Triton X-100 at 37&#x000b0;C for 5 min, unless stated otherwise. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min and all coverslips were blocked in PBS/3% BSA for 1 h. Primary antibody incubations were in PBS/3% BSA for 1 h at RT, followed by four washes of PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and diluted 1:200 in PBS/3% BSA. Coverslips were washed, submerged in PBS containing DAPI, washed once with PBS, and mounted using ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Anti-Bub1 (1:500) was purchased from Abgent. Anti-GFP was used at 1:1,000. Anti-centromere antiserum (ACA; 1:100) was purchased from Antibodies, Inc. Anti-hZw10 (1:50) was described previously (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hirose et al., 2004</xref>), anti-hZwint1 (1:100) was a gift of M. Goldberg (Cornell University), anti-BubR1 (5F9; 1:500) was a gift of S. Taylor (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK), and mouse anti-Mad1 (9B10; 1:100) was a gift of T. Yen (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitation of immunofluorescence</title><p>Images acquired on the DeltaVision microscope (see previous section) were quantitatively deconvolved, converted to maximum projections and saved as 16-bit TIFF files without scaling, after which ACA staining was used to draw regions containing all kinetochores using MetaMorph software. Regions were then transferred onto images of Mad1, Mad2, or Bub1 to be quantitated. Area, average pixel intensity, and integrated intensity of each kinetochore-containing region (KCR) was acquired and exported to Microsoft Excel. Values for a 400-pixel square background region from each cell were also obtained and several background values for each cell were averaged. Integrated intensity was calculated by multiplying the area of the KCR times the average intensity of the background square and subtracting this value from the total integrated intensity of the KCR. Resulting integrated intensities were normalized against the highest value obtained and then averaged and graphed.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting</title><p>Immunoprecipitation of Zwint-1<sup>LAPtag</sup> was done as described for the affinity purification, using rabbit anti-GFP antibody coupled and cross-linked to Affi-Prep protein A support (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The matrix was washed and resuspended in 2&#x000d7; Laemmli sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were standard. Antibodies and dilutions used were anti-GFP (1:1,000), anti-tubulin (DM1a; 1:2,000), and anti-hZW10 (1:500). All antibodies to <italic>Xenopus</italic> proteins were at 1:1,000.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cells were washed once with PBS and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol for 16 h.

Incubation with FITC-conjugated donkey-anti&#x02013;rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was for one hour on ice and in the dark. After a final wash with PBST, DNA was stained with propidium iodide and measured on a FACS-Vantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).</p></sec><sec><title>Colony outgrowth assay</title><p>To measure general toxicity of ZW10 and Zwint-1 depletion, cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes and 4 d after transfection cells were split to different confluencies. 16 h after that, cells were retransfected with the oligos. Surviving colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted 7 d after retransfection.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows the alignment of <italic>Xenopus</italic> ZW10 and Rod-COOH with human orthologues.

Here we report a rational approach to improving the antitumor activity of &#x003b1;-GalCer by using delayed interleukin (IL)-21 treatment to mature the &#x003b1;-GalCer&#x02013;expanded pool of NK cells into highly cytotoxic effector cells. In a series of experimental and spontaneous metastases models in mice, we demonstrate far superior antitumor activity of the &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 combination above either agent alone. Superior antitumor activity was critically dependent upon the increased perforin-mediated cytolytic activity of NK cells. Transfer of &#x003b1;-GalCer&#x02013;pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) followed by systemic IL-21 caused an even more significant reduction in established (day 8) metastatic burden and prolonged survival. In addition, this combination prevented chemical carcinogenesis more effectively. Combinations of IL-21 with other NK cell&#x02013;activating cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-12, were much less effective in the same experimental metastases models, and these cytokines did not substitute effectively for IL-21 in combination with &#x003b1;-GalCer. Overall, the data suggest that NK cell antitumor function can be enhanced greatly by strategies that are designed to expand and differentiate NK cells via DC activation of NKT cells.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: &#x003b1;-GalCer, &#x003b1;-galactosylceramide; FasL, Fas ligand; Flt3L, fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand; iNKT, invariant type I NKT; MCA, methylcholanthrene; pfp, perforin; pIL-21, plasmid IL-21; pORF, plasmid open reading frame; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>NK cells are components of the innate immune system that play a protective role against some viral infections and tumors (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). These functions are achieved by the ability to recognize and lyse target cells and the provision of cytokines, such as IFN-&#x003b3;, that control tumor initiation and metastases (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). We and others have established that the activation of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells via the CD1d glycolipid ligand, &#x003b1;-galactosylceramide (&#x003b1;-GalCer), protects the host from tumor cell metastases in several experimental mouse models (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). iNKT cell activation by soluble &#x003b1;-GalCer, leads to rapid downstream activation of other immune cells, including NK cells, which express CD69, secrete IFN-&#x003b3;, become more cytotoxic, and proliferate (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The antimetastatic activity of soluble &#x003b1;-GalCer, depends exclusively upon iNKT cell and NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Even greater antimetastatic activity of &#x003b1;-GalCer has been achieved by ex vivo pulsing and transfer of syngeneic DCs with &#x003b1;-GalCer (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Soluble &#x003b1;-GalCer and &#x003b1;-GalCer&#x02013;pulsed autologous DCs have been examined in phase I clinical trials in humans who have advanced cancer, and notably, NK cell activation has been detected (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The promising immunomodulatory activity of &#x003b1;-GalCer has stimulated us to evaluate novel means of further enhancing host antitumor activity.</p><p>Advances have been made in understanding the cytokines that stimulate NK cell proliferation; however, much less is known about the regulation of NK cell differentiation. IL-21 is related structurally to the lymphoid cytokines, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15, and was demonstrated to be expressed by activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The IL-21R is expressed in lymphoid tissues and shows homology to the common &#x003b2; chain of the IL-2 and IL-15 receptors. Like these receptors, IL-21R forms a complex with &#x003b3;c and can transduce signals via the Jak/STAT pathway (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). IL-21 has pleiotropic roles in the lymphoid lineages, including the promotion of CD8<sup>+</sup> effector cell function (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and the inhibition of IgE production in B cells (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Within the NK cell lineage, IL-21 was reported to enhance NK cell maturation from human multipotent bone marrow progenitors and to activate peripheral NK cells in the absence of other stimuli (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This is in contrast with mouse NK cells, where IL-21 was reported to have an inhibitory effect on the IL-15&#x02013;promoted expansion of NK cells, and to have no function in the absence of activating signals, such as IL-15 or IL-12 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). After mouse NK cells are stimulated, IL-21 increases cytotoxicity and IFN-&#x003b3; production over that observed for IL-15 alone (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The distinct differences between the two species have been hypothesized to be a result of the immunological naivety of mouse NK cells as compared with human cells (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This late and largely additive function of IL-21 in the mouse NK cell lineage is compatible with the reported phenotype of IL-21R&#x02013;deficient mice, whose in vivo resting NK cell compartment is normal (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and others (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) established that systemic IL-21 alone in vivo promotes NK cell&#x02013;mediated antimetastatic activity. Given the NK cell proliferative effects of &#x003b1;-GalCer and the ability of IL-21 to differentiate further activated mouse NK cells, we hypothesized that the combination of &#x003b1;-GalCer and IL-21 might display synergistic activities. Herein, we demonstrate extremely potent innate antitumor activity and mechanism of the &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 combination in a variety of tumor models.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>&#x003b1;-GalCer expands and activates peripheral NK cells</title><p>Because we previously established that &#x003b1;-GalCer&#x02013;mediated suppression of tumor metastases by activation of iNKT cells and secondary expansion and activation of NK cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), we reasoned that the ability of IL-21 to differentiate further such activated NK cells might enable a combined antitumor activity of &#x003b1;-GalCer and IL-21. We first used flow cytometry of populations of splenocytes harvested from B6 WT mice receiving &#x003b1;-GalCer to determine the kinetics of NK cell activation and expansion. NK cell numbers were enumerated and CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells were evaluated for CD69 expression 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 d after the second of two 1-&#x003bc;g &#x003b1;-GalCer inoculations (days &#x02212;4 and 0; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Maximal numbers of activated NK cells were obtained 2&#x02013;3 d after the second inoculation (two- to threefold greater than vehicle control in spleen and more than 30-fold greater than vehicle control in liver), whereas the number and activation status of NK cells began to reduce significantly by 4 d after the final &#x003b1;-GalCer treatment (not depicted and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).

To express mouse IL-21, we used a hydrodynamics-based gene delivery technique and a single injection of 20 &#x003bc;g mouse plasmid (p) IL-21 DNA that previously had been shown to result in high levels of circulating IL-21 in vivo for up to 5 d after plasmid administration (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). &#x003b1;-GalCer&#x02013;treated mice were injected with control plasmid open reading frame (pORF) vector or IL-21 pORF vector 3 d after the second &#x003b1;-GalCer injection (where the second injection of &#x003b1;-GalCer is designated day 0).

Splenic NK cells typically express Mac-1 (30% Mac-1<sup>lo</sup> and 70% Mac-1<sup>hi</sup>), and an immature NK cell developmental stage in the mouse has been defined by Mac-1<sup>lo</sup> expression (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Mice that were treated with &#x003b1;-GalCer displayed a significantly greater frequency of Mac-1<sup>lo</sup> NK cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> C); this suggested that although &#x003b1;-GalCer expanded NK cell numbers, a large proportion of these were a Mac-1<sup>lo</sup> phenotype. Further treatment with the pORF vector did not alter this distribution; however, in mice receiving pIL-21, a proportion of NK cells was altered significantly as defined by Mac-1<sup>hi</sup> expression.

Herein, we have shown that a DC&#x02013;iNKT cell interaction prompted by the CD1d-reactive ligand, &#x003b1;-GalCer, can create a pool of prestimulated NK cells that responds strongly to systemic IL-21 treatment. In a series of tumor models in mice, we demonstrate the far superior antitumor activity of the &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 combination above either agent alone. Transfer of &#x003b1;-GalCer&#x02013;pulsed DCs followed by systemic IL-21 caused a particularly significant reduction in established (day 8) metastatic burden and prolonged survival. The combination also was effective in the early treatment of subcutaneous disease and in preventing MCA-induced sarcoma. Combinations of IL-21 with other NK cell&#x02013;activating cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-12, were not effective in the same experimental models, and these cytokines did not substitute effectively for IL-21 in combination with &#x003b1;-GalCer. However, the production of both of these cytokines by DCs was an important component in the effectiveness of the &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 combination. The superior antitumor activity of &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 also was critically dependent upon increased and sustained pfp-mediated cytotoxicity by NK cells and host IFN-&#x003b3; activity. Overall, the data suggest that NK cell antitumor function can be enhanced greatly by strategies that are designed to expand and differentiate NK cells via DC activation of NKT cells.</p><p>In two different experimental tumor metastases models, the combination of &#x003b1;-GalCer and IL-21 required pfp- and IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;dependent mechanisms for optimal antitumor activity. IL-21 alone previously was shown to differentiate NK cells terminally and greatly enhance their pfp-mediated cytolytic activity and cytokine secretion (IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-10; reference <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In several different experimental models, the in vivo antitumor activity of IL-21 also seemed to be strictly dependent upon pfp-mediated cytotoxicity (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Herein, we have shown enhanced pfp expression and sustained NK cell pfp-dependent cytotoxicity when IL-21 treatment followed &#x003b1;-GalCer priming. More NK cells also were mature as defined by Mac-1<sup>hi</sup> expression after the addition of pIL-21, whereas NK cells from pORF-treated mice contained a greater proportion of Mac-1<sup>lo</sup> NK cells that have been shown to be immature and display lower cytotoxic activity compared with Mac-1<sup>hi</sup> NK cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Significant NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; production was not detected after the &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 combination. Therefore, we contend that the synergistic antitumor activity of the &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 combination is explained largely by the sustained increase in pfp-dependent cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells that have been expanded in number after &#x003b1;-GalCer activation of iNKT cells and fully matured by IL-21. The role that IFN-&#x003b3; plays in the antitumor activity of the &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 combination is less obvious. Clearly, &#x003b1;-GalCer alone demonstrates pfp-independent antitumor activity that requires IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by NK cells and iNKT cells, and the enhanced cytotoxicity of NK cells after &#x003b1;-GalCer treatment is IFN-&#x003b3;-dependent (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The retention of considerable antitumor activity of the &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 combination in IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was consistent with the ability of &#x003b1;-GalCer to expand NK cell numbers in IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;deficient mice to a large extent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). It remains possible that early IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by iNKT cells or NK cells after &#x003b1;-GalCer may be required for additional downstream effects on NK cells or other cellular populations that may respond to IL-21.</p><p>Although soluble &#x003b1;-GalCer and DC&#x02013;&#x003b1;-GalCer were reported to act primarily via DC IL-2 and IL-12 production (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), these cytokines could not substitute for &#x003b1;-GalCer when administered systemically before IL-21 injection. In part, this may be because &#x003b1;-GalCer additionally elicits IL-3, GM-CSF, and TNF from mouse and human NKT cells that may enable the peripheral mobilization of myeloid progenitors (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and greater NK cell proliferation and NK cell cytotoxicity (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Preliminary experiments suggest some role for DC IL-2 and IL-12 in the synergistic activity of the &#x003b1;-GalCer/DC/IL-21 combination (unpublished data). We were unable to test the importance of IL-15 produced by DCs in the synergistic activity of &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21; however, our previous studies indicated that IL-15 and IL-21 together promote the terminal differentiation of NK cells (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and others recently showed that DC IL-15 is not always the most important regulator of NK cell activity (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Nevertheless, a possible role of DC IL-15 in &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 synergy remains to be tested formally.</p><p>This study raises the possibility that IL-21 might be used successfully with other biological response modifiers to stimulate tumor immunity.

However, Flt3L increases the relative number of functional NK cells in the spleen and blood of mice in vivo (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), and dose- and time-dependent increases in NK cell number up to &#x0003e;30-fold were reported in some organs (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, we are examining the combined antitumor activity of Flt3L and IL-21. The capacity of IL-21 to enhance pfp-mediated cytotoxicity may be realized fully in stimulating the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of NK cells. The therapeutic effectiveness of several promising humanized mAbs that are reactive with tumor antigens (e.g., trastuzumab, rituximab, cetuximab) may be improved further in combination with IL-21. However, it is clear that human NK cells have distinct activation requirements with respect to IL-21 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and the efficacy of any of these strategies using IL-21 will require clinical assessment after IL-21 is deemed safe in early phase trials in humans.</p><p>According to a previous report, the DC-&#x003b1;-GalCer response, as assessed by the number of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;secreting iNKT cells, was much stronger and prolonged than that obtained with soluble &#x003b1;-GalCer (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Our experiments confirmed that the DC&#x02013;&#x003b1;-GalCer response also was associated with a superior protection against experimental tumor metastases. Nevertheless, soluble and DC-pulsed &#x003b1;-GalCer displayed synergistic activity when combined with delayed treatment with systemic IL-21. The synergistic combination also seemed to be effective in suppressing the initiation and growth of subcutaneous tumors; however, it is now important to test further the ability of DC/&#x003b1;GalCer/IL-21 combinations to suppress chemical- and oncogene-driven carcinogenesis as well as established solid tumor deposits. Recently, it was shown that activation of iNKT cells by &#x003b1;-GalCer rapidly activates the maturation of DC, and thereby, acts as an adjuvant for T cell immunity to a coadministered protein (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). It is now of interest to evaluate the capacity of IL-21 to promote further T cell immunity and memory to foreign- and self-antigens in such a context.</p></sec><sec><title>

The cytolytic activity of NK cells from various vehicle/&#x003b1;-GalCer&#x02013; and pORF/pIL-21&#x02013;treated mice was tested against Yac-1 target cells by a standard 6-h <sup>51</sup>Cr release assay as described previously (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometric analysis.</title><p>Mononuclear cells from the spleen, liver, and thymus were isolated as described. For staining NK cells, mononuclear cells were preincubated with CD16/32 (2.4G2) mAb to avoid the nonspecific binding of antibodies to Fc&#x003b3;R. Then the cells were incubated with a saturating amount of PE-Cy5.5&#x02013;conjugated TCR&#x003b2; mAb, APC&#x02013;NK1.1 mAb, and FITC-CD69 mAb or FITC-CD11b/Mac-1 mAb or PE-NKG2D mAb. To analyze intracellular levels of NK cell IFN-&#x003b3;, spleen cells were harvested and incubated for 2 h in vitro with Golgistop (BD Bioscience). The cells were incubated with a saturating amount of PE-Cy5.5&#x02013;conjugated TCR&#x003b2; mAb and PE-conjugated NK1.1 mAb. An APC-conjugated IFN-&#x003b3; mAb or isotype-matched control mAb was used after the cells were fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/perm Buffer (BD Biosciences). For internal controls, mice were injected with poly I:C (200 &#x003bc;g, Sigma-Aldrich) and spleen cells were harvested 3 h later and subjected to intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; staining.

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was retained. Equal amounts of protein (determined by means of a Bradford reaction) were separated on 12.5% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose transfer membranes. Immunoblots were probed with rat mAb PI-8 to mouse pfp or mouse mAb to human &#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor cell lines.</title><p>The following standard experimental mouse tumor cell lines were used in vitro and in vivo: Yac-1 lymphoma (NK cell sensitive); B16F10 melanoma (pfp-sensitive, FasL- and TRAIL-insensitive, H-2<sup>b</sup>); 4T1 mammary carcinoma (pfp- and TRAIL-sensitive and FasL-insensitive, H-2<sup>d</sup>), and Renca renal cell carcinoma (pfp- and TRAIL-sensitive and FasL-insensitive, H-2<sup>d</sup>). The maintenance of all tumor cell lines and the sensitivities of lung metastases to various cytotoxic molecules in vitro and in vivo were described previously (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor models in vivo.</title><p>B16F10 and Renca tumor cell lines were inoculated i.v. and 4T1 was inoculated into the mammary gland at the dose indicated in the figure legends. The &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21 treatment schedule was evaluated for its ability to reduce the expected metastatic tumor burden. For B16F10 and Renca experimental metastasis models, mice were injected i.v. with tumor cells and killed 14 d later, the lungs removed, and surface metastases counted with the aid of a dissecting microscope. In the 4T1 model, female mice were inoculated into the mammary gland with 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells on day 0; 8 d later the primary tumor (&#x0223c;10 mm<sup>2</sup>) was resected surgically. Mice were killed at 25 d and spontaneous metastasis was measured by harvesting lungs and livers as described (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Clonogenic metastases were calculated on a per organ basis. In all metastasis models, the data were recorded as the mean number of metastases &#x000b1; SE of the mean. Some groups of treated and control mice were monitored for survival and data are recorded as the mean survival time (d) &#x000b1; SE of the mean. Mice were killed at the first signs of labored breathing or loss of weight and ruffled fur, and lung tumor was confirmed by autopsy. Significance was determined by a Kruskal-Wallis test. Sarcomas were induced in male mice by 400 &#x003bc;g MCA in 0.1 ml maize oil in various &#x003b1;-GalCer/IL-21&#x02013;treated C57BL/6 mice as described previously (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).

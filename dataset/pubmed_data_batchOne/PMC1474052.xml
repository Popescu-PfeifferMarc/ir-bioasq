These proteins then assemble into processive hexameric helicases upon the single-stranded DNA that they create. In T-antigen, a characteristic loop and hairpin structure (the pre-sensor 1&#x003b2; hairpin, PS1&#x003b2;H) project into a central cavity generated by protein hexamerization. This channel undergoes large ATP-dependent conformational changes, and the loop/PS1&#x003b2;H is proposed to form a DNA binding site critical for helicase activity. Here, we show that conserved residues in BPV E1 that probably form a similar loop/hairpin structure are required for helicase activity and also origin (<italic>ori</italic>) DNA melting. We propose that DNA melting requires the cooperation of the E1 helicase domain (E1HD) and the origin binding domain (OBD) tethered to DNA. One possible mechanism is that with the DNA locked in the loop/PS1&#x003b2;H DNA binding site, ATP-dependent conformational changes draw the DNA inwards in a twisting motion to promote unwinding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>T-antigen and E1 both function as hexameric helicases in the replication of Simian virus 40 (SV40) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) and papillomavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) DNA, respectively, but also perform the initiation function required for helicase loading, generating the single-stranded origin (<italic>ori</italic>) DNA from which processive unwinding can proceed. The assembly and structure of SV40 and bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) initiator complexes are now well understood. In BPV, the E1 helicase forms in a stepwise manner and requires the assistance of the viral transcription factor E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, dimers of E1 and E2 first bind cooperatively to <italic>ori</italic> where E1 and E2 sites are side by side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The function of this E1E2&#x02013;<italic>ori</italic> complex is to generate the specificity and affinity for origin DNA binding that E1 alone otherwise lacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). This is achieved, in part, by the ability of E2 to modulate the non-specific DNA binding activity of the E1 helicase domain (EIHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). In a subsequent reaction that requires ATP, E2 is displaced and more E1 molecules are recruited to <italic>ori</italic>. The function of this E1&#x02013;<italic>ori</italic> complex appears to be stable and specifc origin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), although structural changes in the DNA ultimately leading to strand separation may begin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). This complex is a tetramer and the recruitment of more E1 molecules, mediated via the E1 sequence-specific DNA binding domain, leads to <italic>ori</italic> melting either side of the E1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Recent work suggests that the <italic>ori</italic>-melting complex can be viewed as two functional trimers that ultimately become two hexameric helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). However, despite this detail, the challenge of relating structure to function remains.</p><p>The recent crystal structures of a fragment of SV40 T-antigen have revealed features that may aid in the understanding of DNA binding, melting and unwinding by the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). T-antigen (residues 251&#x02013;627) forms a two-tiered hexameric structure with a longitudinal cavity that opens to form a wide central chamber. The channel is strongly positively charged, and it has been proposed that strand separation can occur within the chamber, as double-stranded DNA is threaded through the complex. There are also six positively charged holes formed between monomers on the side-walls of the large chamber, which may form an exit for single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The nucleotide hydrolysis cycle appears to induce large expansions and contractions of the channel, which may be important for origin melting and helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Studies with the electron microscope have demonstrated the presence of DNA in the central channel, and its binding also appears to induce structural changes in the protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Positively charged and ring-shaped aromatic amino acids on a &#x003b2;-hairpin (the pre-sensor 1 &#x003b2;-hairpin, PS1&#x003b2;H) and a loop structure that undergo large NTP-dependent movements are key for T-antigen unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). A phenylalanine (on the loop) and a lysine (on the PS1&#x003b2;H) are absolutely conserved in helicase superfamily 3, and in papillomavirus there is an extended conserved sequence motif, FWL (amino acids 464&#x02013;466 in BPV E1), on the loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> illustrates the positioning of the conserved residues in the T-antigen hexamer. Information for a fragment of HPV 18 E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) suggests that these features are structurally conserved between SV40 and papillomavirus, and a structural representation of the BPV sequence modelled on the available structural information is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>. Here we have asked if the conserved residues of the &#x003b2;-hairpin and aromatic loop in BPV E1 are required for helicase activity and also <italic>ori</italic> DNA melting. Our findings demonstrate a requirement for the same amino acid in both these processes, indicating a mechanistic relationship between DNA melting and processive unwinding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Expression and purification of the full-length E1 protein were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).

Mutagenesis was performed by overlapping primer extension, and all sequences verified in full using fluorescent primer or chain terminator technologies (LiCore/ABI).</p><p>Transformed <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cultures were grown at 22&#x000b0;C and induced with IPTG for 6&#x02013;8 h after reaching an <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> 0.8&#x02013;1. All purification procedures were performed at 4&#x000b0;C. Frozen cells (&#x02212;80&#x000b0;C) were lysed by sonication in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0, 4&#x000b0;C), 0.9 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol and 1 mM phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) following treatment with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 30 min.

Following thrombin cleavage, the protein extract was diluted with 5 vol of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol and 1 mM PMSF, and applied to a 1 ml Source-S column (Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated with the same buffer containing 50 mM NaCl. The column was developed over a gradient from 50 to 350 mM NaCl and peak fractions pooled. The protein was purified further by anion exchange chromatography (Source-Q, 1 ml column) as described for full-length E1, and the peak fractions pooled, concentrated and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Protein concentrations were determined by BioRad assay with BSA as a standard, and purity assessed on Coomassie stained SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels.</p></sec><sec><title>ATPase assays and helicase assays</title><p>ATPase assays were performed in 20 mM HEPES&#x02013;NaOH, 135 mM NaCl, 1 m M DTT, 0.01% NP-40, 7.5 mM ATP, 8.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> containing 35 nmol/&#x000b5;l [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) and 4 &#x000b5;M protein.

The 115 base strand was generated from a PCR product produced with one phosphorylated primer and treated with &#x003bb; exonuclease. The initial PCR product was derived from pUC19 constructs bearing BPV origin fragments described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), using the following primers: 5&#x02032;-GACTATGTATTTTTTCCCAGTGTG (top strand, unphosphorylated) and 5&#x02032;-GCTATGACCATGATTACGCC (bottom strand, phosphorylated).

ATPase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) demonstrated that a subset of the mutants retained activities at or close to wild-type levels, but all were active in the presence of a high concentration of a short ssDNA oligonucleotide. This result is surprising since we observed no significant effect of ssDNA on activity of the wild-type protein. The mutant R505E hydrolysed ATP at rates close to wild-type only with ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Mutation of the conserved amino acid K506 to Ala (K506A) resulted in significantly reduced ATPase without ssDNA but increased activity in its presence. K506E was &#x0223c;3&#x02013;4-fold more active than wild-type, with or without ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). H507 was mutated more extensively, since this amino acid is conserved between SV40 and BPV. Without ssDNA, H507A and H507L hydrolysed ATP at a rate similar to wild-type. H507A ATPase was stimulated in the presence of ssDNA, but the activity of H507L did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). H507F was more active than wild-type and not stimulated, but inhibited, by ssDNA. For the hydrophobic loop &#x02018;FWL&#x02019; motif, F464A and F464L hydrolysed ATP at a rate 5&#x02013;10-fold less than wild-type when no ssDNA was present but were active like wild-type in its presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The ATPase activity of F464W was moderately increased relative to wild-type with and without ssDNA. W465A, W465F and L466A were inactive or showed minimal ATPase activity without ssDNA but were all active in its presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Mutants in the Walker A and sensor 1 motifs that are essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (K439A and N523A) were ATPase inactive, with or without DNA (data not shown).</p><p>The active form of the BPV E1 helicase is a hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). We next asked if E1HD and selected mutants were proficient for oligomerization using gel filtration. Wild-type protein was predominantly hexameric, based on the elution of protein standards, as were H507A, K506A and F464W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). W465A and L466A were completely deficient for hexamerization, while R505E, F464A and W465F (data not shown) had an intermediate phenotype in terms of the ratios of monomer to hexamer formed, as indicated by the values given below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We did not observe discernable peaks corresponding to intermediate forms from monomer through to hexamer with wild-type or any of the mutants, indicating that hexamerization is a highly cooperative event. The trend that emerged was that deficiency in oligomerization appears to correlate with reduced ATPase activity in the absence of DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Helicase activity of E1HD and mutants</title><p>We next asked how the RKH/FWL amino acid substitutions affect helicase activity using a 70 bp DNA strand annealed to a 115 bp strand with a 45 bp 3&#x02032; overhang as a substrate. Representative data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>, while the results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> (500 nM E1HD). Wild-type E1HD unwound DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;6), but high concentrations of protein were inhibitory. R505E was active and showed no inhibition of unwinding at high protein concentration (lanes 7&#x02013;10), while glutamic acid (K506E, lanes 11&#x02013;14) or alanine substitutions (data not shown) of K506 were inactive. The H507F substitution unwound DNA at a similar level to wild-type, while the activity of H507A and H507L were reduced (lanes 15&#x02013;26 compared with lanes 3&#x02013;6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). A definitive correlation with size of the amino acid side chain did not emerge, as the mutant H507K was only 10% active (data not shown). All substitutions in the FWL region were inactive or virtually inactive for helicase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>), even the conservative substitutions F464W and W465F.</p></sec><sec><title>ssDNA binding</title><p>The PS1&#x003b2;H and hydrophobic loop form a ringed array in the central channel of T-antigen, through which DNA is proposed to thread as it is unwound. Wild-type E1HD bound ssDNA to a greater extent in the presence of ATP (ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>; herein referred to simply as ATP) compared with its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4, top compared with bottom). R505E did not bind DNA without ATP but was active in its presence (lanes 5&#x02013;7, top compared with bottom). K506E and K506A were inactive for DNA binding (lanes 8&#x02013;13, top and bottom), with or without ATP, except for formation of a fast-migrating species for K506A with ATP (lane 13, bottom). For the H507 substitutions (lanes 14&#x02013;22), ssDNA binding was dependent on the bulk of the amino acid side chain (HF &#x0003e; wild-type &#x0003e; HL &#x0003e; HA), and in each case augmented in the presence of ATP. The gel-shift pattern for H507L and H507A with ATP indicated a level of complex instability, judged by some partial retardation of probe (lanes 15 and 16, 18 and 19).</p><p>In the hydrophobic loop, all substitutions inhibited ssDNA binding without ATP, except the conservative substitution F464W that bound oligonucleotide at wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, lanes 11&#x02013;13, upper panel). All mutants showed increased binding in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, lower panel), with the substitution W465F exhibiting significantly increased activity compared with all others (lanes 11&#x02013;13).</p></sec><sec><title>Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding and the roles of PS1&#x003b2;H and hydrophobic loop residues in <italic>ori</italic>-melting</title><p>In the presence of ATP an E1&#x02013;<italic>ori</italic> complex forms where the HD contacts the DNA either side of the E1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and melts the origin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). To test the effects of helicase domain mutations on origin binding and DNA melting, selected mutations were constructed in full-length E1 and proteins expressed and purified. We analysed the Ala, Leu and Phe/Trp mutations of residues H507 and F464 that are conserved between SV40 and BPV, and the R505E, K506E, W465A and L466A mutations (the lysine and leucine are also conserved between BPV and SV40).</p><p>Mutation of the conserved residues in both the PS1&#x003b2;H and hydrophobic loop altered DNA binding in the presence of ATP, and sample data are presented as part of the analysis of <italic>ori</italic> melting described subsequently (see below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the PS1&#x003b2;H the K506E mutant was most severely defective for dsDNA binding, requiring &#x0223c;10-fold higher concentrations of protein to achieve complete binding site occupancy. Binding of R505E and H507A was reduced &#x0223c;2-fold, while H507A and H507F were similar in activity to wild-type. In the hydrophobic loop, binding of F464A, W465A and L466A were all reduced 2&#x02013;3-fold, while increasing the bulk of the side chain of amino acid 464 restored binding to near wild-type levels (Wild-type = F464W &#x0003e; F464L &#x0003e; F464A). For wild-type E1, efficient unwinding is only achieved at 100% site occupancy, which correlates with the generation of a distinct hydroxyl-radical cleavage pattern (14, see below). Accordingly, we established E1 binding reactions in the presence of ATP with a carefully determined titration to achieve complete site occupancy for all proteins tested. DNA melting was then probed using potassium permanganate sensitivity, and melted DNA regions were revealed on sequencing gels. A sample of the reaction processed for gel-shift/site occupancy analysis is shown below each potassium permanganate melting assay, illustrating the results for dsDNA binding described above. All tested substitutions in the PS1&#x003b2;H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) melted DNA in the AT-rich region and over the E2 binding site except K506E (and the Ala substitution, data not shown) that was inactive (lanes 2&#x02013;4 compared with lanes 8&#x02013;10). For R505E (lanes 5&#x02013;7) and H507A (lanes 11&#x02013;13) melting over the A/T-rich region was reduced &#x0223c;2&#x02013;2.5-fold, but melting downstream of the E1 binding site at nucleotide 20 (nt. 20, indicated by an arrow) was similar to wild-type. Amino acid substitutions at position 507 with increasingly bulky side chains favoured DNA melting (H507F = H507L &#x0003e; H507A; lanes 11&#x02013;20). For DNA melting, the hydrophobic loop was less tolerant to amino acid substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). F464A was completely inactive for DNA melting (lanes 5&#x02013;7 compared with lanes 2&#x02013;4), while increasing the bulk of the amino acid side chain recovered minimal but detectable activity (lanes 11&#x02013;20). W465A was inactive for <italic>ori</italic> melting (lanes 14&#x02013;16), while L466A supported reduced activity (lanes 17&#x02013;19).</p></sec><sec><title>High-resolution footprinting of E1 and mutants</title><p>As described above, <italic>ori</italic> DNA melts when more E1 molecules are loaded on a minimal E1&#x02013;<italic>ori</italic> complex in the presence of ATP, and this correlates with the generation of a distinct DNA footprint.

DNA binding at high E1 concentrations with ATP results in complete protection over and beyond the E1 binding site, which diminishes at the flanks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, lane 7 compared with lane 3). When footprints of mutants in the PS1&#x003b2;H motif (lanes 8&#x02013;23) are compared with wild-type, it becomes clear that failure to melt DNA results from an impairment in progressive E1 binding. K506E, the only mutant inactive for DNA melting, generates a periodic protection pattern indicating that E1 loading is stalled at the level of the precursor E1&#x02013;<italic>ori</italic> complex (lane 13 compared with lanes 7 and 3). R505E and all H507 mutants melt DNA, albeit at a reduced extent, and generate the block protection centred over the E1 binding site (lanes 10, 16, 19 and 22, compared with lane 7). We do note, however, a subtle difference at the boundaries of the H507A and H507L protections, which do not extend to the same extent as wild-type (indicated by the two arrows, compare lanes 7 and 19 for example). For H507F, the flanking protection is enhanced compared with wild-type (lane 7 compared with lane 22), and this is probably a result of promiscuous DNA binding.</p><p>Mutants in the hydrophobic loop behaved similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). The periodic protection pattern emerges for F464A (lane 7 compared with lane 4), a mutant completely inactive for origin melting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). As the bulk of the 464 side chain is increased (F464L and F464W, lanes 10 and 13), the periodic pattern of protection diminishes and this correlates with a recovery of melting activity, although poor. Mutant W465A appeared to behave differently from all other mutants. Although DNA binding activity is reduced with ATP, the mutant exhibits a promiscuous mode of DNA binding, protecting the DNA sequences beyond the initial site of binding. The mutant L466A bound DNA in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type (lane 19 compared with lane 4), and this correlated with significant detectable DNA melting activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have investigated whether or not conserved amino acids in the BPV E1HD are required for both site specific DNA melting and processive DNA unwinding. The roles of two sequences, corresponding to the PS1&#x003b2;H and a hydrophobic loop that project into the central cavity of the T-antigen hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), have been probed by mutagenesis. Our results show that the conserved amino acids of both these features are critical for processive DNA unwinding (helicase activity) by E1. As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, in the PS1&#x003b2;H only mutants K506A and K506E failed to unwind DNA. A defect in ssDNA binding provides the most likely explanation for their loss of function. We were unable to test the effect of the conservative substitution K506R since this mutant failed to express. All H507 mutants unwind DNA, even the equivalent Ala substitution that is inactive in T-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Again, a defect in ssDNA binding may account for the reduced activity of H507L and H507A. Likewise, the activity of mutants in the hydrophobic loop supports the notion that it forms part of a DNA binding site that is intolerant even to subtle structural changes in order to be functional in processive unwinding. This is best illustrated by the proteins with conservative substitutions, F464W and W465F. They retain ssDNA binding activity but have barely detectable helicase activity. The inactivity of mutant L466A also supports the proposal. The equivalent residue L461 in T-antigen is positioned in an internal hydrophobic structural core rather than at the surface of the hexameric channel. The Ala substitution would be predicted to shrink the protein core, altering the positioning of the hydrophobic loop in a way that could impair DNA binding. Together, these results indicate that K506 of the PS1&#x003b2;H and F464 and W465 of the hydrophobic loop are the principal components of a composite DNA binding structure in the BPV E1 helicase.</p><p>Among all the mutants tested the helicase activity of R505E is surprising since it is impaired in all activities, including ssDNA binding, required for unwinding. Furthermore, high protein concentrations did not inhibit unwinding. Many helicases, including bacteriophage T7 helicase gp4A&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), require a substrate with an ssDNA tail that is excluded from the protein complex in order to initiate unwinding <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that a structural feature of the tailed substrate is recognized and bound by the helicase. This is also true of T-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and the E1HD (C. Sanders and S. Castella, unpublished data), suggesting that the proficiency of R505E could be explained in terms of this recognition reaction rather than oligomerization on ssDNA. Oligomerization of E1HD on the ssDNA strand that must otherwise be excluded during unwinding could explain why helicase activity is inhibited at high protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) but not in the case of R505E. Also of note is the fact that many mutants only demonstrated significant ATP hydrolysis in the presence of high ssDNA concentrations (2000 times higher than that used in ssDNA binding assays, 3:1 molar ratio of protein:DNA). Since it has been demonstrated that ssDNA promotes hexamerization and ATPase activity of full-length E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), it is likely that high DNA concentrations can drive hexamerization and, hence, ATPase activity of the oligomerization defective mutants.</p><p>Our data indicate that there are mechanistic similarities between <italic>ori</italic> DNA melting and unwinding by E1, since they implicate the same residues required for helicase activity in origin DNA binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, subtle differences were observed in origin DNA binding with and without ATP (data not shown), consistent with cofactor (ATP)-dependent modulation of a non-specific dsDNA binding site in E1&#x02013;<italic>ori</italic>. When we probed <italic>ori</italic> melting by the PS1&#x003b2;H/hydrophobic loop mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) it was clear that the same residues involved in processive unwinding/dsDNA binding were required for <italic>ori</italic> melting, and, hence, the activity of each mutant in DNA melting could be explained also by impaired DNA binding site function. Generation of potassium permanganate hypersensitivity correlates with progression of the hydroxyl radical protection from a periodic pattern to the block protection associate with the E1&#x02013;<italic>ori</italic> melting complex. A defect in E1 binding events is clearly demonstrated for the mutants K506E and F464A that are inactive for melting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>) and whose footprints compare only with the E1&#x02013;<italic>ori</italic> complex that forms in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), or low E1 concentrations with ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In the E1&#x02013;<italic>ori</italic> melting complex, the DNA over the E1 binding site is not melted but binding of additional E1 molecules, via the origin binding domain (OBD), is evident by the change in OH footprint. The implications of these observations are that binding of the E1 molecules that generate the final unwound structure and DNA melting are coordinated ATP-dependent events and that the E1HD and OBD cooperate to melt DNA.</p><p>We have, therefore, linked the processes of DNA melting and helicase unwinding in BPV E1 based on the common requirement for amino acids in a non-specific DNA binding site. Structures of the related T-antigen helicase in the ATP-bound, ADP-bound and nucleotide-free forms show a high degree of conformational flexibility. Encircling of DNA in a central channel is considered key in explaining the enzyme's action. In the nucleotide-free form the channel opening is at its widest and at its narrowest with ATP. The smaller tier or domain 1 (D1) of the T-antigen hexamer is linked to the larger tier (D2/D3) via a helical &#x02018;spring&#x02019;, H5, and the interface between monomers is flexible allowing rotation of the tiers. The PS1&#x003b2;H and hydrophobic loop also move longitudinally upon ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), and low-resolution models of T antigen binding to the SV40 <italic>ori</italic> show two hexamers bound in a head to tail array with the hydrophobic loop/PS1&#x003b2;H positioned near the extremities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Although there are no structures of hexameric helicases bound to DNA, crystal structures of PcrA and Rep helicases bound to DNA show conserved aromatic residues binding directly to ssDNA by base stacking and interactions of electropositive residues with the DNA phosphodiester backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). It is, therefore, likely that the PS1&#x003b2;H and hydrophobic loop bind the DNA in a similar manner, allowing it to be drawn into the hexameric chamber where strand separation could occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In BPV it is proposed that the <italic>ori</italic>&#x02013;melting complex is a double trimer of E1 molecules arranged in a head-to-tail array on the origin DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). By analogy with T-antigen it is possible to imagine the two E1 trimers immobilized by the OBD rotating against each other, while the DNA is locked in the hydrophobic loop/PS1&#x003b2;H binding site, drawn inwards and unwound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The mutational analysis that we have described, coupled with the ability to assemble the E1 helicase stepwise <italic>in vitro,</italic> should make this model eminently testable.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from Yorkshire Cancer Research and BBSRC to C.M.S.

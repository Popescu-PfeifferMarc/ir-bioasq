Disruption in the insulin secretion of pancreatic &#x003b2; cells is considered the major cause of diabetes. A mitochondrial protein, uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) has been found to play a critical role in insulin synthesis and &#x003b2; cell survival. Our preliminary studies found that the extracts of American ginseng inhibit UCP-2 expression which may contribute to the ability of ginseng protecting &#x003b2; cell death and improving insulin synthesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that ginseng extracts suppress UCP-2 in the mitochondria of pancreatic &#x003b2; cells, promoting insulin synthesis and anti-apoptosis (a programmed cell-death mechanism). To test the hypothesis, the serum-deprived quiescent &#x003b2; cells were cultured with or without interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), (200 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, a cytokine to induce &#x003b2; cell apoptosis) and water extracts of American ginseng (25 &#x003bc;g per 5 &#x003bc;l administered to wells of 0.5 ml culture) for 24 h. We evaluated effects of ginseng on UCP-2 expression, insulin production, anti-/pro-apoptotic factors Bcl-2/caspase-9 expression and cellular ATP levels. We found that ginseng suppresses UCP-2, down-regulates caspase-9 while increasing ATP and insulin production/secretion and up-regulates Bcl-2, reducing apoptosis. These findings suggest that stimulation of insulin production and prevention of &#x003b2; cell loss by American ginseng extracts can occur via the inhibition of mitochondrial UCP-2, resulting in increase in the ATP level and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2, while down-regulation of pro-apoptotic factor caspase-9 occurs, lowering the occurrence of apoptosis, which support the hypothesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>American ginseng</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>ATP</kwd><kwd>&#x003b2; cell</kwd><kwd>Bcl-2</kwd><kwd>caspase</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>UCP-2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>As a devastating illness with significant morbidity and mortality, diabetes mellitus has increased steadily worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Type I juvenile diabetes is known as an auto-immune disease possibly caused by an over-immune reaction resulting in extensive destruction of the insulin-producing &#x003b2; cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). While the cause of type II adult-onset diabetes remains poorly understood, all patients with type I diabetes and part of type II diabetes require daily insulin shots, replacement of the destroyed &#x003b2; cell mass <italic>via</italic> islets or transplant of pancreas in order to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>The use of herbal remedies has been on the rise in the United States (380% over the last 7 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Historical treatment of diabetes utilizes traditional medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and integrates of ginseng root extracts in tonic form into the diet. Ginseng root has been used for millennia in ancient Asian tonics for its restorative and curative properties. American (<italic>Panax quinquefolius</italic> L.) and Asian ginsengs (<italic>Panax ginseng</italic> CA Meyer) stand as the two widely used species of ginseng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). However, the species display contrasting effects. Asian ginseng exhibits an effect on blood flow and decreases fatigue, while American ginseng leans towards decreasing aging and regulating digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The role of American ginseng has been shown to facilitate anti-hyperglycemia but whether American ginseng improves on pancreatic &#x003b2; cell function is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).</p><p>&#x003b2; cell dysfunction and death are attributed to the inability to produce sufficient amounts of insulin, which can be caused by many factors. One possibility contributing to the loss of insulin would be the gradual loss of &#x003b2; cells, possibly through programmed cell death (apoptosis) in which cells appear to shrink, chromatin condenses and DNA is cleaved into pieces at internucleosomal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Membrane &#x02018;blebbing&#x02019; eventually leads to the breakdown of the cell into small bodies that are quickly taken up by neighboring cells without inflammation. The Bcl-2 proto-oncogene is the most fully characterized protein substance which plays a key role in regulating programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In addition, initiation of the Caspase cascade involves translocation of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from mitochondria to the cytoplasm to activate caspase-9 then cleave pro-caspase-3, initiating the proteolytic cascade essential for apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Lack of insulin production results from a shortage of ATP produced within the mitochondria, indicating that mitochondrial ATP plays a critical role in insulin production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>A mitochondrial protein, uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2), uncouples electron transport from ATP production by transporting protons across the inner membrane, suppressing ATP production. Studies have shown that high levels of UCP-2 negatively regulate insulin secretion <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> by yielding ATP generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Some degree of uncoupling exists in many if not all cells and tissues and evidence suggests that uncoupling might be useful in limiting chronic exposure to harmful reactive oxygen species generated in the mitochondria but the inefficiency inherent with uncoupling may provide a significant disadvantage in cellular survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Accordingly, studies have shown that even modestly increased levels of UCP-2 protein reduce cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of the study is to explore the effects of American ginseng root extracts on the pancreatic &#x003b2; cell's function and survival with a cytokine, interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) induced &#x003b2; cell dysfunction model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Mechanisms involved in achieving up-regulated insulin production and lowered apoptosis levels were determined by evaluating the activation of ATP, UCP-2, Bcl-2 and caspase-9.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ginseng Root Preparation</title><p>Sliced American ginseng (<italic>Panax quinquefolium</italic> L.) root was purchased from H.S.U Corp. (WI, USA). The ginseng root was soaked in 10 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O for 24 h at 4&#x000b0;C on a rotator with gentleshaking. The supernatant appeared yellow. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was lyophilized to yield the solid product which was weighed and diluted to yield a final concentration of 5 &#x003bc;g &#x003bc;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. One lot of ginseng was used to prepare this solution over the course of the study and it was stored at &#x02212; 4&#x000b0;C for less than 1 week. There was no evidence of degradation during the 1 week storage period since ginsenoside is stable in pH 7.0 water solution but unstable in acid solution. The concentration is determined by weight per volume. Components of American ginseng present in the solution include the most water- soluble parts (Ginsenoside R<sub>o</sub>, Rb1, Re, Rg1, Rg2, Rg3, Rf, <italic>quinquenoside</italic> R<sub>1</sub>, gypenosede X1 and water soluble material, Vitamins and metals as well as undefined elements) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Rat pancreatic &#x003b2; cell derived cell line, INS-1, was a gift from Dr Claes Wollheim (Centre M&#x000e9;dical Universitaire, Geneva, Switzerland).

Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 &#x003bc;M 2-mercaptoethanol to maintain differentiation. Semi-confluent (80&#x02013;90%) monolayer cells in 100 mm polystyrene dishes (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, New Jersey) and 15&#x02013;40 passage cells were used for the experiments. IL-1&#x003b2; (200 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was added to cell cultures to induce cell apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and fixed with fixation solution (acetone:methanol:dH<sub>2</sub>O) for 20 min at room temperature (RT). Slides were then blocked with 1% normal goat serum for 10 min at RT and incubated with primary insulin antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-insulin 1:30 in PBS-T) at RT for 2 h. The slides were washed with PBS-T three times and anti-mouse second antibody (Texas Red Anti-Mouse 1:200) was then applied for 20 min. After the second antibody, the slides were washed with PBS-T five times and DAPI was added (for nuclei staining; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Finally, the slides were covered with cover glass.</p></sec><sec><title>Tunel Staining (Apoptosis Test)</title><p>The detection of apoptotic nuclei using the TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method was performed with ApoAlert&#x02122; DNA Fragmentation Assay Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and incubated in 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 5 min to block endogenous peroxidase. The slides were then incubated with fluorescent-conjugated avidin in PBS for 2 h at RT. After three washes, slides were coverslipped with glycerol-phosphate buffer. Apoptotic cells were counted in at least 10 random fields and expressed as a percentage of the total cell number (apoptotic index).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of ATP Content (Bio-Luminescence)</title><p>The Enliten&#x02122; ATP Assay system with a bioluminescence detection kit (Promega Madison, WI) was used for ATP measurement. The principle of the assay is that luciferase from <italic>Photinus pyralis</italic> catalyses <sc>d</sc>-luciferin in the presence of ATP and oxygen to oxyluciferin, Pi, AMP, carbon dioxide and light. As described above, cells after removal or removal/incubation were transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes with 50 &#x003bc;l TCA (5%) and immediately homogenated with a plastic homogenizer. The suspension was spun at 2000 r.p.m. and the supernatant stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until assay. ATP was measured according to the kit protocol. Briefly, samples were neutralized to pH 7.4 with 10 &#x003bc;l 4 M Tris and 10 &#x003bc;l added to a new tube with 90 &#x003bc;l ATP-free water. The luciferase reagent was added 1 s before a 5 s measurement in the luminometer, as suggested by the supplier. Light photons were measured by a luminometer and were compared with an ATP standard curve to calculate ATP concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Protein content in the supernatant was determined with a spectrophotometric Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The ATP level was standardized by divided protein content. ATP content is expressed in micromolar.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Insulin Measurement</title><p>Insulin concentrations in the specimen (culture medium and cell extracts) were measured using Ultra Sensitive Rat Insulin ELISA Kit (Crystal Chem Inc., Downer Grove, IL) according to the vendor's instruction. The collected culture medium was used to perform insulin assay. The cell extracts were extracted using 5% TCA then neutralized with 4 M Tris buffer. Briefly, insulin standards and appropriately diluted (1:50) samples were added to an insulin antibody-coated 96-well microplate and incubated for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing five times, anti-rat insulin enzyme conjugate was added to the well and incubated for 30 min at RT. After washing seven times, an enzyme substrate solution was added and then incubated up to 45 min at RT in the dark. The reaction was halted by adding 1 N sulfuric acid. Absorbance at 450 nm was read with a &#x003bc;Quant microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) and concentrations were calculated by KC Junior<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> microplate reader software (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.).</p></sec><sec><title>Western Blotting Analysis</title><p>Pancreatic &#x003b2; cells (INS-1) were plated in a monolayer at 10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on 35 &#x000d7; 10 mm plates.

After electrophoresis (200 V for 45 min), the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h in a transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine and 20% methanol). The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with 1:1000 rabbit anti-caspase-9 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA), Bcl-2 antibody or primary UCP-2 antibody (Anti-Rabbit monoclone antibody, Alpha-Diagnostic Intl, San Antonio, TX) in PBS-T (PBS&#x02013;0.5% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk at 4&#x000b0;C for 24 h. The membrane was then washed and incubated with a second antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase diluted to 1:2000 in PBS-T at RT for at least 2 h. The primary antibody immunoreaction was detected by incubating the membrane with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) for 5 min. The membrane was then exposed to Kodak film that captured the signal. The nitrocellulose membranes were stripped with anti-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Analysis of the immunoreactions was carried out using specialized imaging software (NIH image analysis system) and computer equipment from the Central Research Facility at Rhode Island Hospital. The results were normalized by actin signal.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All the data are represented as means &#x000b1; SEM and analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey&#x02013;Kramer test unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>American Ginseng Increases Pancreatic B Cell Insulin Secretion/Production and Cell Survival</title><p>The effect of American ginseng was observed to be dosage-dependent on both insulin levels and apoptosis. <italic>In situ</italic> imaging results show that American ginseng extracts in &#x003b2; cell culture increased insulin positive cells as well as prevented IL-1&#x003b2; (200 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Measurement of the response of Bcl-2 and caspase-9 to American ginseng extracts in cultures showed American ginseng inducing a higher expression of Bcl-2 and preventing activation of caspase-9 by western blotting. The determining levels of caspase-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>) in cultures was quantified by densitometry analysis and normalized by actin.</p></sec><sec><title>Decrease UCP-2 Levels</title><p>UCP-2 negatively mediates ATP production and causes cell death.The effects of ginseng on UCP-2 levels were investigated in order to see which factors American ginseng affects to achieve cell longevity.

Data showed American ginseng to be an enhancer of ATP production under IL-1&#x003b2; induced anti-ATP circumstance. ATP levels were drastically lowered by IL-1&#x003b2; but American ginseng stimulated an increased output of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Throughout history, the ginseng root has been used in its water-extract form. Evaluation of the water soluble material from ginseng in extracts could be beneficial in the attempt to find ginseng's biological activation. The main active component in ginseng, which is responsible for ginseng's medical value, has been identified as glycoside. Other than the glycosides, minor constituents include volatile oils (member of vitamin B complex), manganese, vanadium, copper, cobalt, fatty acids, amino acids, simple sugars and other carbohydrates [Dixon, P. Ginseng. Gerald Duckworth &#x00026; Co. Ltd (1976)]. Glycoside is a naturally occurring substance consisting of a sugar and non-sugar moiety. A glycoside which produces froth under agitation by reducing water surface tension is called a saponin. A group of saponins in ginseng were named ginsenosides, and were classified into subclasses Ro, Ra, Rb, Rc, Rd, Re, Rf, Rg, and Rh. These ginsenosides were differentiated based on their retention factor (<italic>R</italic><sub>f</sub>) values in thin layer chromatography (TLC), which is the distance that the ginsenosides travel up the TLC column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). A range of chemical components with biological activity including ginsenosides, alkaloids, polypeptides and polysaccharides have been isolated. By 1992, Liu and Xiao reported that 28 ginsenosides had been found in different parts of the ginseng plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The report summarized the range of effects that ginsenoside had, which included cardio-protective, immunomodulatory, anti-fatigue and hepato-protective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Oriental ginseng can be distinguished from American ginseng using ginsenoside profiles as the former contains ginsenoside Rf while the latter does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The anti-hyperglycemic effects of the total ginsenosides extracted from Chinese ginseng (TGCG) were evaluated in diabetic C57BL/6J ob/ob mice. The results indicated that in a diabetic ob/ob mouse model TGCG was endowed with significant anti-hyperglycemic and anti-obesity properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). One ginsenoside component, Re was evaluated in the same animal model and the anti-hyperglycemic effect had been found to be caused by improving the muscle's metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). No evaluation of pancreatic function was reported in these studies. However, ginsenoside components could potentially be substances which improve the pancreatic islet function in creating the anti-hyperglycemic effect.</p><p>Previous studies have revealed that American ginseng lowers blood glucose in diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) and benefits pancreatic &#x003b2; cell insulin production, secretion and prevents &#x003b2; cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Data presented in the current project suggest that the effect of American ginseng in stimulating insulin production/secretion and anti-apoptosis is dosage dependent, which indicates biological specificity of ginseng extracts on &#x003b2; cells. A high dosage of ginseng reversed IL-1&#x003b2; induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>), which suggests that high dosage of American ginseng is required for healing/repairing damaged &#x003b2; cells but not for normal cells (lesser effect of high-dosage American ginseng on &#x003b2; cell apoptosis; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of UCP-2 activation in the mitochondria could be a major mechanism for the effects of American ginseng on &#x003b2; cell function. Elevations of UCP-2 levels were observed under an IL-1&#x003b2; cytokine induced pancreatic &#x003b2; cell dysfunction model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). UCP-2, a protein belonging to the large family of the anion mitochondrial transporters, is believed to negatively regulate metabolism. The uncoupling protein family consists of three main uncoupling proteins. UCP-1 is well understood and characterized as an uncoupler in brown adipocytes and controls heat production. UCP-2 and 3 are not well known but are proposed as ancestors of UCP-1. The role of UCP ancestral functions was to facilitate the adaptation of cells to oxygen through uncoupling of respiration. It is believed that UCP-2 is linked to anti-hyperinsulinemia after the presence of the UCP-2 gene was detected in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Potassium channels are uncoupled by UCP-2 upon the inner membrane of the mitochondria, relieving the osmotic proton pressure via alternative channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). It is known that the ATP/ADP ratio controls insulin secretion, which could be through the inhibition of mitochondrial UCP-2 expression. UCP-2 levels in relation to ATP and insulin production were observed by the over expression of UCP-2 inhibited insulin secretion and increased ATP levels. An inhibition of UCP-2 production reversed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). In this study, we found that IL-1&#x003b2; significantly increased UCP-2 expression, which was reversed by American ginseng root extracts accompanied by an increase in ATP and insulin levels in cultured &#x003b2; cells. This is consistent with the ability of ATP in playing a critical metabolic role that controls insulin secretion, and is mediated primarily by UCP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Thus, stimulation of insulin synthesis and ATP production by American ginseng can be achieved through the regulation of the mitochondria and mitochondrial proteins, UCP-2, by affecting the ADP/ATP ratio response.</p><p>Though little information and research shows the specific role of UCP-2 on cell viability and longevity, cells with an abnormally high UCP-2 level tend to exhibit a decrease in cell livelihood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). A major cause of shortened cell livelihood would be the process of programmed cell death (apoptosis). A model utilizing cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; to induce apoptosis provided a platform for observing the effects of American ginseng on apoptotic factors and overall apoptosis. Several protease families are implicated in apoptosis, the most prominent being caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Apoptosis is inhibited by the mitochondrial integral membrane protein Bcl-2, suggesting that the mitochondria are a crucial mediator in the apoptosis process. Bcl-2 inhibits the activation of the Caspase cascade by suppressing the release of mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). At the commencement of the mitochondria-regulated apoptosis, cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, a factor in electron transport is released from the mitochondria, which leads to the activation of pro-caspase-9, followed by activation of the entire cascade and nuclear defragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>In our studies, American ginseng extracts reversed IL-1&#x003b2; induced increase of UCP-2 and pro-apoptotic protein caspase-9 and reduced anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and ATP levels, indicating that the anti-apoptotic effects of American ginseng could be achieved through regulating mitochondrial UCP-2, ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) and apoptotic factors (caspase-9/Bcl-2 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), thus influencing insulin synthesis and apoptotic cascades in &#x003b2; cells. It is the first study to show that American ginseng root extracts can directly regulate the &#x003b2; cell biochemical processes, which contribute to improving &#x003b2; cell function with regard to insulin production and cell survival, all of which may be directly connected to American ginseng's anti-hyperglycemic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Further research is required to fully understand the effects of American ginseng extracts on pancreatic &#x003b2; cells and factors utilized by American ginseng to achieve cell regulation and function. American ginseng may enhance pancreatic &#x003b2; cell viability through various alternative factors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This publication was made possible partially by NIH Grant Number P20RR018757 from the National Center for Research Resources.

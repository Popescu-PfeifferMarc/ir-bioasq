Since RJ contains testosterone and has steroid hormone-type activities, we hypothesized that it may have beneficial effects on osteoporosis. We used both an ovariectomized rat model and a tissue culture model. Rats were divided into eight groups as follows: sham-operated (Sham), ovariectomized (OVX), OVX given 0.5% (w/w) raw RJ, OVX given 2.0% (w/w) RJ, OVX given 0.5% (w/w) protease-treated RJ (pRJ), OVX given 2.0% (w/w) pRJ, OVX given 17&#x003b2;-estradiol and OVX given its vehicle, respectively. The Ovariectomy decreased tibial bone mineral density (BMD) by 24%. Administration of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol to OVX rats recovered the tibial BMD decrease by 100%. Administration of 2.0% (w/w) RJ and 0.5&#x02013;2.0% (w/w) pRJ to OVX rats recovered it by 85% or more. These results indicate that both RJ and pRJ are almost as effective as 17&#x003b2;-estradiol in preventing the development of bone loss induced by ovariectomy in rats. In tissue culture models, both RJ and pRJ increased calcium contents in femoral-diaphyseal and femoral-metaphyseal tissue cultures obtained from normal male rats. However, in a mouse marrow culture model, they neither inhibited the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-induced calcium loss nor affected the formation of osteoclast-like cells induced by PTH in mouse marrow culture system. Therefore, our results suggest that both RJ and pRJ may prevent osteoporosis by enhancing intestinal calcium absorption, but not by directly antagonizing the action of PTH.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bone mineral density</kwd><kwd>bone tissue culture</kwd><kwd>ovariectomized rats</kwd><kwd>post-menopausal osteoporosis model</kwd><kwd>protease-treated RJ</kwd><kwd>royal jelly</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>With the growing aged population, we urgently need to develop new and effective treatments for chronic and protracted diseases, e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, cancer as well as cardiovascular and brain ailments. Recently, more and more unconventional therapies have been used for treating these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>The peak bone mass of women is less than that of men because of the decrease in bone mass owing to menopause. Therefore, women are vulnerable to bone loss known as post-menopausal osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The primary cause for this symptom is an estrogen deficiency. An ovariectomized rat model, which artificially produces estrogen deficiency, has been used for the study of post-menopausal osteoporosis. Both aged and mature rats have been employed as animal models for experimentally induced osteoporosis. The mature rat model has characteristics which are seen in early post-menopausal bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Using this model, several compounds were screened and found to be effective for the therapeutic management of osteoporosis; namely, estrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), bisphosphonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), calcitonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), calcium products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and anabolic steroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Recently, efficacy of traditional Chinese (Kampo) medicines has been reevaluated by clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Kampo medicines have less side effects, and therefore, seem to be more suitable for a long-term medication. We reported their inhibitory effects on both the progression of tibial bone loss and the alteration of periodontium induced by ovariectomy in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>Royal jelly (RJ) is the principal food for the honeybee queen. This is produced in the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of worker honeybees and has been demonstrated to possess several pharmacological activities, such as life-span-elongating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), antifatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), antiallergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), antitumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), antihypercholesterolemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), antihypertensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) and anti-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Indeed, RJ has been used worldwide as commercial medical products, health foods and cosmetics. The chemical composition of RJ was reported to be proteins, sugars, lipids and vitamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). It contains many bioactive substances such as 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), proteins mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and antibacterial protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). RJ contains testosterone and has activities similar to other steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Therefore, RJ may be beneficial for osteoporosis. Although RJ has been traditionally known to improve post-menopausal symptoms, to our knowledge, no one has studied whether or not it prevents the decrease of bone mass, which is one of the deleterious symptoms for post-menopausal women.</p><p>Therefore, we undertook this study to evaluate the efficacy of RJ and protease-treated RJ (pRJ) in preventing osteoporosis using the mature rat model. We included pRJ because this is known to enhance intestinal absorption of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). In order to analyze the mechanism of action of these compounds, their <italic>in vitro</italic> effects on the bone formation were also investigated using a bone tissue culture model.

Twenty-seven days later [90-days-old; a mature rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) was used], six rats were given a sham operation (control rats; first group) and 42 rats were bilaterally ovariectomized under nembutal (pentobarbital sodium; 50 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight: Abbott Lab., IL, USA) anesthesia. They were also equally divided into the second to the eighth groups. The second group received orally MF powdered pellets (Oriental Yeast Co.

However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>, the presence of PTH (10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M) induced a significant decrease in calcium content in the diaphyseal or metaphyseal tissues. This decrease was not significantly prevented in the presence of RJ (50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) or pRJ (50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Osteoclast-like Cell Formation</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>, the presence of PTH caused a significant increase in osteoclast-like cell formation in mouse marrow culture system <italic>in vitro</italic>. This increase was not significantly suppressed by either RJ (1&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) or pRJ (1&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been reported that ovariectomy (OVX) increased food intake and body weight and these changes could be inhibited or reversed by treatment with estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). In fact, the mean daily food consumption of OVX rats in 2&#x02013;7 weeks was higher than that of Sham rats by 21% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). The administration of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol preserved the level of normal food consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Since neither RJ nor pRJ caused a decrease in food consumption in ovariectomized rats (during Weeks 2&#x02013;7), their effect seems to be different from that of estrogen. However, it is noticed that 2% (w/w) pRJ seems to have a greater effect than its lower concentration [0.5% (w/w)] or both RJ's concentrations. Both values of the food intake and the weight gain of OVX + pRJ-2 rats were below those for OVX rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Their food consumption reached a plateau at 2 weeks similar to that of the Sham rats.</p><p>OVX also caused an increase in body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>), which had been postulated not only to be associated with regulatory effect of estrogen on the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) but also to provide a partial protection against the development of osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The increase in food consumption in ovariectomized rats (21% increase as described above) may in part contribute to the increase in body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). However, OVX rats gained more weight than Sham control rats in the pair-fed condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that OVX rats seem to make more efficient use of their food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>).</p><p>A marked atrophy of the uterus has been used as evidence of the success of ovariectomy, because estrogen directly influences uterine weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Indeed, ovariectomy also resulted in a dramatic decrease in uterine weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Since both RJ and pRJ did not increase uterine weight, it is suggested that these agents do not influence the actions of estrogen or its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p><p>The primary proof for an effective antiosteoporotic agent is believed to be a prominent inhibitory effect against bone loss. The administration of 2.0% (w/w) RJ, 0.5% (w/w) pRJ and 2.0% (w/w) pRJ to the OVX rats recovered BMD by 14, 16 and 24%, after 7 weeks, while that of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol recovered BMD by 34%. The efficacy of the inhibition of bone loss by 2.0% (w/w) RJ, 0.5% (w/w) pRJ and 2.0% (w/w) pRJ was 41, 47 and 71% of that of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol. The efficacy of pRJ on the tibial BMD was greater than that of RJ.</p><p>Ovariectomy resulted in a decrease in the connectivity of cancellous bones in the epiphysis and that of the trabecular bones in the metaphysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). Our data show that pRJ was more effective than RJ in inhibiting the elution of bone calcium, because the connectivity in OVX rats was restored by the administration of 2.0% (w/w) pRJ. The appearance was comparable with that of the Sham rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>).</p><p>After the protease treatment of RJ, the contents of sodium, calcium and free amino acids increased by 7.8, 1.6 and 3.0 times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Their increased content of sodium was derived from the addition of NaOH, which was used to adjust pH during the protease treatment. The reason for the increase of calcium content is not known. However, the effects of these increases may be small because food itself contains large amounts of sodium and calcium, and because the percentages of RJ and pRJ in the food are very small.</p><p>Nakasa <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) reported that pRJ significantly promoted calcium absorption in the intestine as compared to that of raw RJ. Therefore, it is conceivable that the greater effect of pRJ may be caused by the enhanced digestibility (or utility) and by its promotion of calcium absorption in the intestine. The protease treatment of RJ eliminates the protein fractions above 10 000 molecular weight from RJ, leaving the peptides of 500&#x02013;3000 molecular weight (MW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Phosphoserine or acidic amino acids contained in peptides in pRJ could selectively bind calcium and facilitate calcium transport across the intestinal membranes.</p><p>As opposed to the <italic>in vivo</italic> models, both RJ and pRJ were similarly effective in increasing the calcium contents in the rat femoral-diaphyseal and femoral-metaphyseal tissue culture models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). However, they did not inhibit the PTH-induced calcium loss in the femoral tissues and PTH-induced formation of osteoclast-like cells in mouse marrow culture system <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). These observations demonstrated that both RJ and pRJ have a stimulatory effect on bone formation, but that they do not have an inhibitory effect on bone resorption.</p><p>Combining these <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> results, we speculate that the mechanism of action of RJ or pRJ is to stimulate calcium absorption of bone. The greater efficacy of pRJ in the animal model may be derived from the enhancement of intestinal calcium absorption by pRJ. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other factors, such as calcium-regulatory hormones or cytokines, are also involved.</p><p>Recently, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) has raised serious concerns about its safety because of tumor-inducing side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Our initial study shows that the RJ products may be used as alternative agents for the treatment of osteoporosis without such side effects, may be different from that for Kampo medicines or isoflavones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Since RJ contains a male hormone testosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), this agent may also be effective in men's osteoporosis that could be induced by a decrease of androgen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).</p><p>In summary, both RJ and pRJ inhibited the progression of bone loss induced by ovariectomy in rats to a similar degree to that of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol. The results of <italic>in vitro</italic> tissue culture suggested that both nutrients increased calcium content of the femoral tissues. Our data indicated that pRJ seems to be more efficacious. We believe that pRJ may be useful in humans for the prevention of not only post-menopausal osteoporosis but also osteoporosis in general.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a

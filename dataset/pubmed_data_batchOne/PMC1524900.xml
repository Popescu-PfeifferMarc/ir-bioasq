In addition to the known literature properties (preferable hybridization with RNA and resistance to endonuclease hydrolysis), we also observed higher resistance of 4&#x02032;-thioDNA to 3&#x02032;-exonuclease cleavage. Furthermore, we found that fully modified 4&#x02032;-thioDNAs behaved like RNA molecules in their hybridization properties and structural aspect, at least in the case of the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex. This observation was confirmed by experiments using groove binders, in which a 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex interacts with an RNA major groove binder, lividomycin A, but not with DNA groove binders, to give an increase in its thermal stability. Since a 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex competitively inhibited the hydrolysis of an RNA duplex by RNase V<sub>1</sub>, it was not only the physical properties but also this biological data suggested that a 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex has an RNA-like structure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Synthetic short oligonucleotides (ONs), especially RNA molecules, are assuming an increasingly important role in chemistry because of their potential utility in antisense, ribozyme, RNA aptamer and RNA interference applications. Thus far, a variety of modified nucleoside units have been synthesized and incorporated into ONs with the aim of developing useful applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Among the nucleoside derivatives developed, sugar-modified nucleosides, including 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-alkylated nucleosides, 2&#x02032;,4&#x02032;-bridged nucleosides and 2&#x02032;-deoxy-2&#x02032;-fluoronucleosides, seem to be the most promising units for developing functional ONs because the corresponding ONs show high hybridization properties and nuclease resistance. In our group, we have been working on developing 4&#x02032;-thionucleic acids as functional ONs. These ONs consist of 4&#x02032;-thionucleosides, a different mode of sugar-modified nucleoside analogue from the above mentioned sugar-modified nucleosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). We have already reported the synthesis and properties of 4&#x02032;-thioRNA, which is made up of 4&#x02032;-thioribonucleosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Since 4&#x02032;-thioRNAs exhibited high hybridization ability, nuclease resistance and structural similarity to A-form RNA duplexes, applications for isolating the 4&#x02032;-thioRNA aptamers by SELEX and developing modified short interfering RNAs containing 4&#x02032;-thioribonucleosides are currently under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). As part of our research project, we became interested in the properties of 4&#x02032;-thioDNAs, which consist of 2&#x02032;-deoxy-4&#x02032;-thionucleosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although Walker and his coworkers had investigated the synthesis and properties of 4&#x02032;-thioDNA, the ONs prepared were only partially modified with 2&#x02032;-deoxy-4&#x02032;-thiopyrimidine nucleosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). However, their preliminary results showing high hybridization to the complementary RNA and endonuclease (nuclease S1) resistance of 4&#x02032;-thioDNA seemed promising for the development of functional ONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Thus while carrying out further investigations on 4&#x02032;-thioDNAs, we discovered some unexpected properties of 4&#x02032;-thioDNA.</p><p>Herein we describe the first synthesis of fully modified 4&#x02032;-thioDNAs consisting of four kinds of 2&#x02032;-deoxy-4&#x02032;-thionucleosides, the practical synthesis of which was recently reported by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), and the properties of these 4&#x02032;-thioDNAs, including unexpected RNA-like behavior in hybridization and structural aspects, based on CD spectra and enzymatic recognition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>General Materials and Methods</title><p>Experimental procedures and physical data for phosphoramidite units and CPG supports of 2&#x02032;-deoxy-4&#x02032;-thionucleosides were given in Supplementary Data.

Each of phosphoramidite units was used at a concentration of 0.1 M in dry acetonitrile, and the coupling time was extended to 10 min for each step. After completion of the synthesis, the CPG support was treated with concentrated NH<sub>4</sub>OH at 55&#x000b0;C for 16 h, and the support was filtered off. The filtrate was concentrated and the oligodeoxynucleotide protected by a DMTr group at the 5&#x02032; end was chromatographed on a C-18 silica gel column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (from 5 to 40%) in 0.1 N triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) buffer (pH 7.0). The fractions were combined and concentrated. The residue was treated with aqueous acetic acid (70%) for 15 min at room temperature. The solution was concentrated, and the residue was purified on reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using a J'sphere ODS-M80 column (4.6 &#x000d7; 150 mm; YMC) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (from 5 to 25%) in 0.1 N TEAA buffer (pH 7.0).

We first synthesized a series of ONs1 (DNA1, thioDNA1 and RNA1) followed by a series of the complementary ONs2 (DNA2, thioDNA2 and RNA2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These sequences are the same as those used in our previous study for 4&#x02032;-thioRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Thermal stabilities of the complementary duplexes were measured by ultraviolet melting experiments in a buffer of 10 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0) containing 100 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (thermodynamic parameters measured by differential scanning calorimetry are presented in the Supplementary Data). Homoduplexes consisting of natural DNA and RNA, namely DNA1:DNA2 and RNA1:RNA2, had <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values of 55.7 &#x000b1; 0.2 and 66.2 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C, respectively. A duplex of thioDNA1:thioDNA2 showed a higher <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> value (65.2 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C) than that of DNA1:DNA2, and it was similar to that of RNA1:RNA2. <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> measurements were also carried out for heteroduplexes. The heteroduplex RNA1:DNA2 (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 51.6 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C) was less thermally stable than the corresponding homoduplexes (DNA1:DNA2 and RNA1:RNA2). When RNA1 was changed to thioDNA1, the corresponding <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> value was nearly the same (thioDNA1:DNA2 = 48.3 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C) as that of the RNA1:DNA2 heteroduplex. In contrast, thioDNA1 formed a thermally stable duplex with RNA2 (thioDNA1:RNA2) to give a <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> value of 64.6 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C, which is similar to that of RNA1:RNA2. The overall order of thermal stabilities for these six duplexes was RNA1:RNA2 &#x02248; thioDNA1:thioDNA2 &#x02248; thioDNA1:RNA2 &#x0003e; DNA1:DNA2 &#x0003e; RNA1:DNA2 &#x02248; thioDNA1:DNA2. These results led us to believe that 4&#x02032;-thioDNA may behave as an RNA-like molecule despite the absence of the 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl groups.</p><p>To confirm our speculation, CD spectra of each duplex were measured. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the duplex DNA1:DNA2 showed a typical B-form spectrum (having a positive band near 280 nm), while that of RNA1:RNA2 was characteristic of an A-form spectrum (having a positive band near 260 nm). The CD spectrum of thioDNA1:thioDNA2 had a positive band near 260 nm though a small shoulder was observed near 280 nm, and thus an A-form of the duplex was suggested. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows the CD spectra of the heteroduplexes, RNA1:DNA2, thioDNA1:DNA2 and thioDNA1:RNA2. The CD spectrum of RNA1:DNA2 was characteristic of an A-like form, while thioDNA1:DNA2 did not show an obvious spectral pattern, and seemed to adopt an intermediate form between the A- and B-forms. When DNA2 was substituted for RNA2, a spectrum of thioDNA1:RNA2 convincingly exhibited the A-form.</p><p>In the CD spectra of nucleic acids, spectra at the longer wavelengths will be affected by the number of bases per helical turn and the inclination of the bases with respect to the helical axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The results discussed above focused on the spectra at the longer wavelengths and suggested an RNA-like behavior of 4&#x02032;-thioDNA in the stacking mode of the nucleobases. On the other hand, spectra at the shorter wavelengths, which represent the conformation of the phosphate&#x02013;sugar backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), were fairly scattered in each duplex. Since 4&#x02032;-thioDNA consists of 2&#x02032;-deoxy-4&#x02032;-thionucleosides, in which the furanose ring oxygen was substituted by a sulfur atom, the conformational change of the phosphate-sugar backbone is not surprising. Walker and his coworkers reported CD spectra and crystal structures of ONs partially containing 4&#x02032;-thiothymidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Their results indicate that the ONs fundamentally form a B-shaped helix and differ from our observation. However these results come from partial modification (only one or two residues) of the self-complementary 12mer DNA sequence, and not a full modification, as in our case. Therefore, we next investigated the interaction between the duplex and some groove binders.</p><p>Groove binders recognize and bind tightly to their own favorite helical structures of nucleic acid duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Therefore, the topology of the helix grooves could possibly be determined by an examination of the interaction with the groove binders. As specific groove binders, commercially available distamycin A (a DNA minor groove binder that recognizes an AATT sequence), methyl green (a DNA major groove binder) and lividomycin A (an RNA major groove binder) were chosen (no selective RNA minor groove binder is known). The differences between <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values (&#x00394;<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>s) in the presence and absence of the groove binder are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The DNA groove binders increased the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values of DNA1:DNA2 by 9.7 (for distamycin A) and 4.0&#x000b0;C (for methyl green), respectively, while no obvious change of the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> value was observed in the presence of the RNA major groove binder, lividomycin A (&#x00394;<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 1.3&#x000b0;C). On the other hand, lividomycin A, but not distamycin A and methyl green, solely increased the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> value of RNA1:RNA2 by 10.2&#x000b0;C. These results indicated that each binder distinguished the topology of each groove in its sequence context. When the experiment was carried out for thioDNA1:thioDNA2, the DNA binders did not increase the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values, while lividomycin A increased the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> value by 4.4&#x000b0;C. Although the degree of thermal stabilization was smaller than that with RNA1:RNA2, the interaction of thioDNA1:thioDNA2 with the groove binders was similar to that of RNA1:RNA2, but not that of DNA1:DNA2. We carried out further experiments using the groove binders for the heteroduplexes. The <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values of RNA1:DNA2 were not changed in the presence of the DNA binders, while lividomycin A increased the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> value by 10.3&#x000b0;C, as in the case of RNA1:RNA2. The CD spectrum suggested that RNA1:DNA2 adopted an A-like form and thus the topology of this heteroduplex would tend to interact with the RNA groove binder. The results obtained with thioDNA1:DNA2 are somewhat ambiguous. The heteroduplex seemed to bind with both distamycin A and lividomycin A, although the interactions were rather small. Since the CD spectrum of thioDNA1:DNA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) showed intermediate characteristics between the A- and B-forms, these results may very well agree with its structural aspect, as suggested by the CD spectrum. For the interaction with thioDNA1:RNA2 which gave the A-form spectrum, only lividomycin A increased the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> value by 6.1&#x000b0;C.</p><p>To further confirm the RNA-like behavior of 4&#x02032;-thioDNA, we prepared a series of ONs3 consisting of a self-complementary Dickerson sequence (DNA3, thioDNA3 and the corresponding RNA3), and a series of homosequences ONs4 and ONs5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The results of the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> measurements and the groove binder experiments are also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, and their CD spectra are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, respectively. For the series ONs3, thioDNA3, like RNA3, formed a more thermally stable self complementary duplex than DNA3, and the resulting duplex showed a preference for interacting with the RNA groove binder, lividomycin A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the CD spectrum of thioDNA3 closely resembled that of RNA3 showing an A-form structure. Differing from the results of the series of ONs3, the duplex consisting of DNA4:DNA5 showed a <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 38.0 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C, while the corresponding RNA4:RNA5 formed a less stable duplex (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 29.3 &#x000b1; 0.3&#x000b0;C). In this sequence, however, the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> value of thioDNA4:thioDNA5, like RNA4:RNA5, was decreased relative to that of DNA4:DNA5. Although the experiment using groove binders showed no significant enhancement of <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values, neither DNA4:DNA5 and RNA4:RNA5 nor thioDNA4:thioDNA5, the CD spectrum of thioDNA4:thioDNA5 was markedly different from that of DNA4:DNA5, and rather similar to that of RNA4:RNA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since duplexes consisting of poly[dA]:poly[dT] are known to adopt a different helical structure from the typical B-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), the results obtained in the groove binder experiments may not be so surprising.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclease sensitivity of 4&#x02032;-thioDNAs</title><p>Walker and his coworkers reported nuclease sensitivity of a 4&#x02032;-thiothymidine-containing ON separated by one unmodified residue at the 3&#x02032; end using snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVPD; a 3&#x02032;-exonuclease) and nuclease S1 (an endonuclease). According to their report, the modified ON showed high resistance to hydrolysis by nuclease S1, while no significant resistance to hydrolysis by SVPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Since these results came from a poly-T sequence, in which the ON also contained a natural thymidine unit on its 3&#x02032; end and therefore may have been unsuitable for the investigation of degradation by SVPD the nuclease sensitivity was reinvestigated using a fully modified 4&#x02032;-thioDNA. The nuclease sensitivity of 4&#x02032;-thioDNA was examined using DNase I, an endonuclease hydrolyzing both single- and double-stranded DNA, SVPD and 90% human serum. The DNA1 and thioDNA1 were labeled at the 5&#x02032; end with <sup>32</sup>P and incubated under appropriate conditions in the presence of nuclease or serum (see Materials and Methods). The reactions were then analyzed by PAGE under denaturing conditions (see Supplementary Data), and the resulting half-lives (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>s) calculated based on the ratio of full-length ON at each time point are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. The single-stranded thioDNA1 was completely intact in the presence of DNase I for up to 12 h under conditions in which DNA1 was readily hydrolyzed (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> =1.5 &#x000b1; 0.1 min), and these results agreed with those previously reported for nuclease S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In addition, the thioDNA1:thioDNA2 duplex was also intact in the presence of the same enzyme, while the DNA1:DNA2 duplex afforded a <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of 3.3 &#x000b1; 1.2 min. For sensitivity to SVPD, our experiment afforded different results from the previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The thioDNA1 was slowly hydrolyzed by SVPD (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = &#x0003e;8 h) under conditions in which the DNA1 was readily hydrolyzed (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.4 min). This result may come from the difference between the fully modified thioDNA1 and that containing one natural thymidine unit on its 3&#x02032; end. On further investigation of sensitivity in 90% human serum, the thioDNA1 was hydrolyzed by the 3&#x02032;-exonuclease (see Supplementary Data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) and <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> was calculated to be 190 &#x000b1; 12 min. Under the same conditions, the DNA1 afforded a <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of 40 &#x000b1; 1.3 min, and thus, it can be concluded that the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA showed significant resistance to both endonuclease(s) and exonuclease(s).</p><p>We have suggested that the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex is structurally closer to an RNA duplex than to a DNA duplex. As mentioned above, the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex was completely resistant to DNase I, and this may be attributed to structural differences. Accordingly, we next examined whether the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex is recognized by DNase I, which would furnish further structural evidence. To that end, an inhibition assay of the nuclease hydrolysis of a DNA duplex by the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex was carried out. As described above, DNA1:DNA2 was hydrolyzed by DNase I with a <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of 5.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). When a 2-fold amount of the thioDNA3 homoduplex, which was used to avoid interstrand exchange, was added as an inhibitor, no obvious elongation of the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> value was observed. Similar to the double-stranded ON, the single-stranded thioDNA1 also did not inhibit the hydrolysis of DNA1 (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 11.7 &#x000b1; 0.4 min vs. <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> =10.1 &#x000b1; 0.1 min). Contrary to the case of DNase I, the thioDNA1 was slowly hydrolyzed by SVPD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and this ON inhibited the SVPD hydrolysis of the DNA1 (data not shown). Weston <italic>et al</italic>. reported the X-ray structure of a DNase I&#x02013;d(GGTATACC)<sub>2</sub> complex, and suggested the importance of the minor groove width and depth of a B-form DNA for their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). This strict recognition of the helical structure by DNase I would be responsible for the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex not being an inhibitor. For the interaction with a single-stranded DNA, it is difficult to define the structure of a single-stranded DNA, and little is known of the interaction with either DNase I or SVPD. In addition, SVPD hydrolyzes not only single-stranded DNA analogs but also RNA analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Therefore, a detailed discussion must await further structural evidence between these nucleases and the single-stranded ONs.</p><p>Since the inhibition assay using DNase I showed that the conformation of 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex differed from the usual B-form structure, we next investigated the interaction with RNase V<sub>1</sub>, which is an RNA duplex-specific endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the duplex of RNA1:RNA2 was readily hydrolyzed by RNase V<sub>1</sub>, and the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> was calculated to be 1.8 &#x000b1; 0.3 min. When a 2-fold amount of the DNA3 homoduplex was added as an inhibitor, no obvious inhibition of the RNA duplex hydrolysis was observed. This result indicates that RNase V<sub>1</sub> does not recognize the B-form DNA duplex as the substrate. In contrast, addition of the thioDNA3 homoduplex apparently inhibited the RNA hydrolysis and the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> was elongated to 8.2 &#x000b1; 2.7 min. Under the same reaction conditions, the thioDNA3 homoduplex alone was completely resistant to hydrolysis by RNase V<sub>1</sub> (data not shown). Since the thioDNA3 homoduplex acted as an inhibitor of RNase V<sub>1</sub>, which recognizes the RNA duplex, a kinetic study was carried out for the interaction with the enzyme. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> values of the RNA1:RNA2 hydrolysis by RNase V<sub>1</sub>, analyzed by Hanes&#x02013;Woolf plots, were estimated to be 76 &#x000b1; 4.0 nM and 65 &#x000b1; 1.5 nM/min, respectively. In the presence of the thioDNA3 duplex as an inhibitor, the secondary plot afforded the same slope as that with no inhibitor, and thus it was concluded that the thioDNA3 duplex is a competitive inhibitor of RNase V<sub>1</sub>. The <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> value of the thioDNA3 duplex was estimated to be 130 &#x000b1; 25 nM. Since the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex has some affinity to RNase V<sub>1</sub>, but not to DNase I, this too suggests an RNA-like behavior of the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex in its interaction with the enzyme. Although the X-ray structure of RNase V<sub>1</sub> has not been solved, Auron <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that the enzyme interacts with the minor groove of the RNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Accordingly, the shape of the minor groove of the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex would be close to that of the RNA duplex, while the similarity of the major groove is suggested from the results of the RNA major groove binder, lividomycin A. In addition, Wyatt and Walker suggested that interaction of RNase V<sub>1</sub> with a 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group in RNA is necessary for efficient cleavage but not for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Our results indicating that the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex was not hydrolyzed by RNase V<sub>1</sub> and that it inhibited this enzyme competitively with RNA duplex are in good agreement with their previous report.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this article, we have presented the first preparation of fully modified 4&#x02032;-thioDNAs consisting of four kinds of 2&#x02032;-deoxy-4&#x02032;-thionucleosides. In addition to the known literature properties (preferable hybridization with RNA and resistance to endonuclease digestion), we pointed out that 4&#x02032;-thioDNA also exhibits higher resistance to 3&#x02032;-exonuclease hydrolysis. Furthermore, we found that fully modified 4&#x02032;-thioDNA behaved as an RNA-like molecule in its hybridization properties and structural aspects, at least in the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA:4&#x02032;-thioDNA homoduplex. The experiments using groove binders and nucleases also supported this unexpected behavior. It is known that the B-form DNA duplex is forced to change to the A-form helical structure under dehydrating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), while our results suggested that the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex adopted the A-form in aqueous buffer at neutral pH and moderated salt conditions. The most typical change of the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA is the substitution of the furanose ring oxygens (termed O4&#x02032;) by the more hydrophobic sulfur atoms (termed S4&#x02032;). Since the O4&#x02032; oxygens play a critical role in stabilizing minor groove hydration spines via a series of hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), the substitution of S4&#x02032; sulfurs would disturb this type of hydration, and give a dehydrated environment. Consequently, the 4&#x02032;-thioDNA duplex may adopt an A-form in aqueous buffer conditions. Thus far, oligonucleotide N3&#x02032; &#x02192; P5&#x02032;phosphoramidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) and ONs containing 3&#x02032;-methylene backbones (3&#x02032;-methylene phosphonate backbone, methylene methylimino backbone and amide backbone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) composed of 2&#x02032;-deoxyfuranose-based nucleosides are known RNA-like molecules. The nucleoside units of those modified ONs prefer the 3&#x02032;-endo sugar conformation in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), while that of 4&#x02032;-thioDNA adopts a 2&#x02032;-endo sugar conformation in solution and crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). It is nevertheless worth noting that, despite such structural differences in nucleoside units, 4&#x02032;-thioDNA can adopt an RNA-like conformation. In addition, since 4&#x02032;-thioDNA possesses the phosphodiester linkages and is available via standard ON synthesis, 4&#x02032;-thioDNA should be a new type of RNA-like molecule. Further investigation into its structural aspects and the applications of 4&#x02032;-thioDNA are in progress.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec>

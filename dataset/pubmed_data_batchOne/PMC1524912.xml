Such mechanisms regulate different transcriptional, translational and post-translational processes and include the recently identified transcription induced chimerism (TIC). We have found two novel chimeric transcripts in the chick and quail that result from the fusion of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and insulin into a single mature transcript. The <italic>th</italic> and insulin genes are located in tandem and they are generally transcribed independently. However, it appears that two chimeric transcripts containing exons from both the genes can also be produced in a regulated manner. The TH&#x02013;INS1 and TH&#x02013;INS2 chimeras differ in their insulin gene content, and they encode two novel isoforms of the TH protein with markedly reduced functionality when compared with the canonical TH. In addition, the TH&#x02013;INS1 chimeric mRNA generates a small amount of insulin. We propose that TIC is an additional mechanism that can be employed to further regulate TH and insulin expression according to the specific needs of developing vertebrates.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The basis of an organism's functional and behavioral complexity is a question that currently remains unresolved. After completing the sequencing of multiple genomes, it is accepted that this complexity is not merely determined by the number of genes. Irrespective of the size of the proteome, the sophisticated regulation of gene expression is an aspect that clearly contributes to increased functional complexity across the phyla. Thus, the 20&#x02009;000&#x02013;25&#x02009;000 genes estimated currently in humans can give rise to &#x0223c;1 million proteins, which in combination with other molecules generate &#x0003e;250 cell types in a human being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hupo.org"/>). Alternative splicing is a widespread mechanism used to generate protein diversity in metazoans, and it has been estimated that &#x02248;70% of the genes undergo alternative splicing in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). This mechanism has the potential to introduce tremendous variation as witnessed by the &#x02248;38 000 isoforms that can be generated from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene Down Syndrome Adhesion Molecule gene (Dscam) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Indeed, comparative analyses have shown similar rates of alternative splicing in vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Nevertheless, other processes may also be employed to generate complexity in vertebrates, and multiple transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), 3&#x02032; end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), pre-mRNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and post-translational protein modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) are all important sources of protein diversity.</p><p>Recently, novel mechanisms of co- and post-transcriptional regulation have been identified. As such, microRNAs have been shown to influence mRNA stability or translation, thereby regulating protein production and playing important roles in invertebrate and vertebrate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Another quite unexpected phenomenon that may add complexity to a genome is the generation of chimeric transcripts from two adjacent, apparently independent genes that share the same orientation. Recently, this phenomenon has been termed transcription induced chimerism (TIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), and it is estimated that between 2 and 5% of tandem human genes may be transcribed into chimeric mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>The tyrosine hydroxylase (<italic>th</italic>) and insulin genes are well-characterized independent genes that are situated in tandem, a syntenic organization that is conserved across phyla. While studying the presence of alternative insulin mRNA variants during development, we discovered two chimeric TH&#x02013;insulin transcripts in avian species. We have characterized previously two embryonic mRNA isoforms of insulin that differ from the pancreatic transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and that have a very marked functional impact at the level of translational regulation. Here we have characterized these two chimeric mRNAs, which are developmentally regulated and tissue-specific. These chimeras encoded two TH protein isoforms whose functionality was somewhat diminished with respect to the canonical TH. Our results underscore an additional aspect in the control of <italic>th</italic>/insulin gene expression involving TIC. In our previous reports, we referred to the insulin gene and mRNA as &#x02018;proinsulin&#x02019; since the primary protein product is proinsulin, which is proteolytically processed to insulin in the pancreas but that remains as proinsulin in extrapancreatic tissues. In the current study, we prefer to use the term &#x02018;insulin&#x02019; since this is how it is annotated in the databases (AY377922; NM_205222).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Embryos</title><p>Fertilized White Leghorn eggs (Granja Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Serrano, Salamanca, Spain) and quail eggs (kindly supplied by Dr V.

Both chimeras contain the first 12 of the 13 exons that make up the <italic>th</italic> gene, as well as the 5&#x02032; portion of the last exon excluding the stop codon. This fragment of the <italic>th</italic> gene is fused to exons 2 and 3 of the insulin gene in the first chimera but to only exon 3 of the insulin gene in the second chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The last exon of the <italic>th</italic> gene contains a consensus sequence for an internal 5&#x02032; donor splice site that appears to be used by the TIC pre-mRNA to splice to the 3&#x02032; acceptor site in either exon 2 or 3 of the insulin pre-mRNA, thereby generating the TH&#x02013;INS1 and TH&#x02013;INS2 chimeras, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This internal splicing of <italic>th</italic> exon 13 avoids the stop codon, extending the open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>th</italic> into the insulin gene. The TH&#x02013;INS1 fusion gives rise to a putative TH protein with an altered C-terminus. Thus, the TH&#x02013;INS1 isoform shares regulatory and catalytic domains with the protein encoded by the full-length TH mRNA, but it lacks the last 16 amino acids of the tetramerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). These are replaced by an extended stretch of 67 new amino acids since the insulin ORF overlaps with that of TH in this chimera. The extra 67 amino acids are not coding a part of the insulin protein since the insulin ORF is not kept. As for TH&#x02013;INS2, a premature stop codon is introduced by the chimeric fragment that generates a truncated TH lacking the last 16 amino acids (see Supplementary Figure 1).</p><p>We performed a Southern blot analysis to determine whether the chimeric mRNAs are induced by the transcription of two independent genes or whether they are rather the product of retroposition of a chimeric gene. Chicken genomic DNA hybridized with either a cDNA or genomic TH probe rendered identical restriction enzyme pattern to that predicted in the recently released chicken genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, PCR of E4 chicken genomic DNA with the forward primer targeted to the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) of the <italic>th</italic> gene and the reverse primer in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the insulin gene generated a single amplified fragment of &#x0223c;14 kb. A semi-nested PCR of the first amplification reaction rendered also a single amplimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Sequencing of the PCR product confirmed that this corresponds to the intergenic region. These results confirm the existence of unique TH and insulin gene in the chick genome.</p><p>We further analyzed the nature of these chimeric mRNAs by performing RT&#x02013;PCR on oligo(dT) primed cDNAs. When RT&#x02013;PCR amplification was carried out with a forward primer located either in the first exon of <italic>th</italic> (P1; see primers in Materials and Methods) and a reverse primer in the last insulin exon (P3), two chimeric mRNAs were amplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These transcripts were not unique to the chick since the two chimeras were also found in quail cDNA. Indeed, RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of RNA from stage 10 chick and quail embryos with the forward primer located in the 10th exon of <italic>th</italic> (P4) and the reverse primer in the last insulin exon (P3) demonstrated that the TH&#x02013;INS1 and TH&#x02013;INS2 chimeras were expressed in both avian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Sequencing of the amplification products confirmed their identity and the species of origin. Note that this combination of primers (P4 + P3) permitted better separation of the two chimeras than primers P1 and P3. Moreover, we could also detect the TICs in insulin-expressing quail embryonic retina cells (RTC5; data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). However, we failed to detect the putative TH&#x02013;INS chimeras by RT&#x02013;PCR in RNA from 8.5 day mouse embryos (equivalent to chicken stage 10) using several primer combinations, despite the independent expression of both TH and insulin in these embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Although these results indicate that the TH/insulin chimerism may not occur in mice, we cannot exclude the possibility that the expression of these chimeras in this species or at this stage is below the limits of detection of this technique. Furthermore, genome-wide analysis of the UCSC database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/"/>) failed to identify any expressed sequences, EST or mRNA, that correspond to these TICs in other vertebrate species (Genis Parra and Roderic Gig&#x000f3;, personal communication). This would suggest that either chimera formation is confined to avian species or that the expression of these TICs is highly restricted to a specific tissue and/or developmental stage in other species. Accordingly, TICs identified in the human genome were observed at a single or low-EST copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Moreover, it is well accepted that EST libraries represent only a fraction of the diverse transcripts and splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis of the <italic>th</italic>/insulin synteny</title><p>The insulin-like and the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase (AAAH) genes can be traced to the early metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Moreover, paralogs of each family are located in the genome forming clusters. In humans, the tryptophan hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase genes are situated on chromosome 11 followed by the insulin and insulin-like growth factor (<italic>igf</italic>)<italic>-2</italic> genes. Similarly, chromosome 12 contains the phenylalanyl hydroxylase and <italic>igf-1</italic> tandem. The existence of a paralogous region containing an AAAH gene followed by an insulin-like gene is conserved throughout the vertebrate lineage, even in <italic>Amphioxus</italic> that has been proposed as the archetypal vertebrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Hence, we analyzed the TH&#x02013;insulin synteny in early metazoa. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the <italic>th</italic> ortholog <italic>ple</italic> is located in tandem with several insulin family orthologs (<italic>dilp1-5</italic>) on chromosome 3. Similarly, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> the <italic>th</italic> ortholog <italic>cat-2</italic> is located in tandem with 10 insulin family orthologs (<italic>ins 2&#x02013;6</italic>, <italic>11&#x02013;15</italic>, <italic>19</italic>, <italic>20</italic>, <italic>31</italic>, <italic>32</italic>) on chromosome II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the <italic>th</italic>/insulin synteny is subject to selective pressure owing to the formation of chimeric transcripts.</p><p>Two plausible mechanisms might explain how these chimeras are generated. On the one hand, it has been suggested that TIC generation is due to regulated transcriptional read-through of the upstream gene, as frequently occurs in viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Alternatively, <italic>trans</italic>-splicing between the individual pre-mRNAs may result in chimeric transcripts, as it commonly occurs in nematodes and as has been described in a few mammalian situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). We favor the read-through mechanism, since the <italic>th</italic> and insulin genes are adjacent and in the same orientation. In addition, the intergenic distance between <italic>th</italic> and insulin is relatively short and well-conserved among vertebrates, a fact that could favor the run-off transcription of TH into the insulin gene. In this respect, tandem genes that produce chimeric transcripts have a tendency to reside closer in the genome than the entire gene pair population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). However, at present the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing hypothesis cannot be ruled out and more detailed molecular studies will be required to confirm either hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>The regulation TH&#x02013;INS1 expression</title><p>Using quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR, we studied the expression of the most abundant chimera, TH&#x02013;INS1, throughout development. The levels of TH&#x02013;INS1 mRNA increased between gastrulation and the beginning of neurulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; stage 4 versus stage 8), maintaining a similar level of expression throughout neurulation (stages 8 and 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A similar pattern of expression was also observed for total insulin and TH mRNA. We then compared the relative abundance of the TH&#x02013;INS1 transcript in stage 8 embryo to that in the pancreas where insulin gene transcription is high, and to that in the <italic>substantia nigra</italic> where the <italic>th</italic> gene is preferentially expressed. The TH&#x02013;INS1 mRNA was expressed in different ratios in the three tissues studied. With respect to total insulin mRNA, the highest relative abundance of the TH&#x02013;INS1 transcript arose in stage 8 embryos (11.2%) whereas it was lowest in embryonic day (E) 13 pancreas (0.01%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, the ratio of the TH&#x02013;INS1 transcript with respect to total TH mRNA was greatest in E13 pancreas (5.4%) whereas it was the lowest in E18 <italic>substantia nigra</italic> (0.12%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>These expression profiles suggest that the TH&#x02013;INS chimeras are not the result of transcriptional leakage, where the transcriptional machinery accidentally ignores the termination of the <italic>th</italic> gene and transcribes through the insulin gene. Such leakage would be an unregulated stochastic event. In contrast, we found that the levels of the TH&#x02013;INS1 chimera are regulated throughout development and that they are also tissue-specific. In addition, the TH&#x02013;INS1 mRNA produced by the neurulating embryo (stage 8) was 3.5-fold higher than that generated in the <italic>substantia nigra</italic>, despite the total TH mRNA being 5.3-fold lower in stage 8 embryo than in <italic>substantia nigra</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These results argue against transcriptional leakage, which would be reflected by higher TIC formation in the tissue with more active upstream gene transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the protein products from chimeric transcripts</title><p>As mentioned, the TH&#x02013;INS1 chimera appears to encode a C-terminal isoform of the TH enzyme, and TH&#x02013;INS2 a truncated isoform that lacks the last 16 amino acids of TH (Supplementary Data). To test these predictions, we analyzed HEK293T cells expressing the chimeric mRNAs by western blotting. Immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody generated against the whole TH protein detected three TH isoforms, which presented slight different electrophoretic mobilities in accordance with their predicted molecular masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). No TH immunoreactivity was observed in untransfected cells or cells transfected with an unrelated construct (data not shown). Interestingly, the amount of protein recognized following transfection of the TH&#x02013;INS1 construct was much lower than that observed in cells transfected with either TH or TH&#x02013;INS2 construct. However in northern blots, the mRNAs for the three TH variants were expressed at comparable levels relative to endogenous GAPDH mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Hence, this difference in expression is produced at the post-transcriptional level (see below). Similar results were obtained in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown).</p><p>The TH&#x02013;INS1 chimera also includes the insulin ORF. To assess whether this chimera could behave as a bicistronic transcript, the TH&#x02013;INS1 cDNA was fused to the V5 epitope tag in phase with the insulin ORF to facilitate the detection of insulin. NIH3T3 cells transfected with the TH&#x02013;INS1 chimera produced the TH&#x02013;INS1 protein isoform as well as detectable but low levels of insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The generation of multiple gene products from overlapping reading frames, although common in bacteria and viruses, is rather rare in higher eukaryotes. One of the few examples described in vertebrates is the INK4a/ARF locus which generates two alternative transcripts encoding proteins with distinct reading frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Here we showed a novel transcript in vertebrates, the TH&#x02013;INS1 chimera, that contains two overlapping reading frames encoding different proteins. However, translation of the first cistron imposed strong translation constriction to the second cistron, similarly to the effect of the upAUGs in the pro1A embryonic insulin transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>To study whether the relative decrease in TH&#x02013;INS1 protein was mediated by a difference in mRNA stability, we studied mRNA degradation. The half-life of the TH and TH&#x02013;INS1 chimera transcripts were identical (12 h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>), indicating that the extension of the TH mRNA produced by the fusion of the insulin mRNA did not influence transcript stability. These results prompted us to check the translational activity and protein stability of the chimera. Pulse&#x02013;chase experiments showed that although the translational activity of TH&#x02013;INS1 chimera was higher (compare the time 0 h for both TH and TH&#x02013;INS1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), the half-life of the TH&#x02013;INS1 protein was one-third that of the TH protein (45 min versus 150 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). These differences in protein stability could well account for the marked decrease in steady-state protein levels of TH&#x02013;INS1 with respect to TH and TH&#x02013;INS2. Considering that the only difference between the TH&#x02013;INS1 and TH&#x02013;INS2 proteins is the extension of 67 amino acids in its C-terminal extension, it is plausible that these 67 additional amino acids confer instability to the TH&#x02013;INS1 protein and therefore they act as a &#x02018;degron&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Activity of the novel TH isoforms</title><p>TH is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of cathecholamines, catalyzing the conversion of tyrosine into <sc>l</sc>-DOPA. The holoenzyme is a homotetramer and this assembly is required to generate a fully functional enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). The TH&#x02013;INS1 and TH&#x02013;INS2 proteins only differ from the canonical TH in the tetramerization domain, both of them lacking the C-terminal leucine-zipper motive involved in the assembly of TH tetramers. Therefore, we analyzed how these modifications might affect the enzymatic activity of the protein. We measured <sc>l</sc>-DOPA accumulation in HEK293T cells expressing the TH&#x02013;INS chimeras and compared it to that found in cells expressing the canonical TH. In order to generate equivalent levels of TH and TH&#x02013;INS1 protein, the cells were transfected with different amounts of plasmid. The levels of <sc>l</sc>-DOPA in cells expressing TH&#x02013;INS1 are &#x0223c;5-fold lower than those found in cells expressing similar or lower amounts of TH protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Similarly, cells transefected with the TH&#x02013;INS2 construct produced &#x0223c;6-fold less <sc>l</sc>-DOPA than cells expressing the canonical TH isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the TH&#x02013;INS1 chimera encodes an unstable TH isoform that presents considerably lower enzymatic activity than the canonical TH. Although the TH&#x02013;INS2 generates similar levels of a truncated TH isoform, the enzymatic activity is also greatly diminished. It could be hypothesized that expression of the two chimeric isoforms might represent a mechanism to downregulate TH function. Hence, expression of TH&#x02013;INS1 would result in a severe downregulation, decreasing both the level of protein and its activity, whereas the TH&#x02013;INS2 would generate an intermediate situation affecting only enzymatic activity. It is also noteworthy that the TH&#x02013;INS1 chimera also generates insulin, although at a much lower level than the embryonic Pro1B insulin transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In this context, it represents the third alternative insulin transcript found in early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate the formation of chimeras between the syntenic <italic>th</italic> and insulin genes. These genes have well-characterized independent expression patterns and physiological functions in postnatal organisms. TH expressed in neurons and chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla is critical for the synthesis of essential neurotransmitters, the catecholamines. Conversely, insulin produced and secreted into the blood by the pancreas is a vital anabolic hormone responsible for maintaining glucose homeostasis. However, in recent decades new biological functions together with novel regulatory mechanisms have been identified for proinsulin/insulin [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>)]. During embryonic development and before pancreas formation, insulin acts as a survival factor and it is involved in early morphogenesis. Similarly, it has been suggested that cathecholamines might be involved in morphogenesis during development, preceding neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). These novel physiological roles appear to be paralleled by specific ways to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Here, we have identified two TH&#x02013;INS chimeras which, to our knowledge, are the first examples of TIC in avian species. Our results suggest that these TICs may represent an additional mechanism of regulating the post-transcriptional gene expression of two adjacent genes. Although, further studies are required to determine the physiological implications of the formation of TH&#x02013;INS chimeras, we envisage that they fulfill a relevant function based on the changes in expression levels of both genes. Concomitant with the reduction of full-length TH and insulin transcripts, TIC formation by read-through would restrict the initiation of transcription from the insulin promoter owing to transcriptional interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Finally, studies have begun to reveal that variation in the regulatory regions of particular genes might be associated with species differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). In this context, we speculate that changes in the regulatory elements that permit the formation of TH&#x02013;INS chimeras in avian species may have contributed to their evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.</p></sec>

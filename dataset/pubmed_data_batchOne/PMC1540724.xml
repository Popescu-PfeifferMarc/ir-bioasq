A decrease in transcription of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene to &#x0003c;3% was demonstrated in cells with deletions in all four regions. The Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin was resistant to DNase I digestion in these cells. Thus, the collaboration is shown to convert the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin from the condensed state to a relaxed state. H3 and H4 acetylation decreased to &#x0003c;8% but H3K4 hypermethylation was observed at the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter and exon 3. The collaboration of four regions had virtually no effect on CG hypomethylation in the region upstream the transcriptional start site. Accordingly, neither the DNase I general sensitive state in the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin nor hyperacetylation of H3 and H4 histones in the promoter proximal region causes H3K4 di-methylation or CG hypomethylation in the promoter. From these analyses, a chromatin situation was found in which both an active state, such as enhanced H3K4 methylation, or CG hypomethylation, and an inactive state, such as DNase I resistance in the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin or hypoacetylation of H3 and H4 histones in the Ig-&#x003b2; locus, coexist.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In vertebrate genes that are transcribed cell type specifically, transcriptional regulatory regions are present not only in the promoter proximal region, but also scattered in the upstream region, intron and downstream region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). However, the role of the scattered regulatory regions for cell type-specific transcription remains obscure. In eukaryotic cells, DNA with genomic information is first stored in nucleosomes as the fundamental units, and then highly folded into chromatin. In the process of differentiation, to switch &#x02018;ON&#x02019; the cell type-specific genes that have not been transcribed so far, it is first necessary to convert the chromatin of a gene and its flanking region from an inactive state to an active state. In vertebrate cells, chromatin of the committed or active gene and its flanking region shows the following features: (i) sensitivity to DNase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>); (ii) cell type-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>); (iii) core histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation specific for the active chromatin state, largely at the N- and C-terminal tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>); and (iv) histone variants such as H3.3 and H2AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In addition, hypomethylation at the cytosine (C) residues of the cytosine&#x02013;guanine (CG) dinucleotides is shown in the active promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Cell type-specific DHSs not only correspond to promoters and enhancers but also are likely to be the regulatory regions participating in the change and maintenance of the chromatin structure from an inactive state to an active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). In addition to their presence in and close to committed or active genes, cell type-specific DHSs are reported to reside inside the flanking genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) or between the flanking genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Several investigations have been carried out to determine the regions necessary for chromatin changes in the scattered regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Deletion of DHS1-6 in the mouse &#x003b2;-globin locus control region (LCR) results in an extraordinary low level of &#x003b2;-globin transcription. However, the acetylation of H3 and H4 histones at the &#x003b2;-globin promoter is the same as in the undeleted control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and no change in DNase I sensitivity in the &#x003b2;-globin locus has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Transgenic mice with 0.1 kb deletion of the DHS I region, which constitutes the LCR in the human GH locus, show loss of H3 and H4 acetylation starting from 32 kb upstream of the transcriptional starting site of the GH gene to the GH gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Accordingly, the deleted sequence is essential for the establishment and maintenance of histone acetylation in the GH locus. However, no example has been reported that demonstrates the change in chromatin structure from sensitive to resistant to DNase I by deleting DHS.</p><p>To determine the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of the scattered DHSs, genetic studies such as gene targeting are effective. Chicken B-lymphocyte-derived DT40 cells are particularly useful for gene targeting because of the high rate of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Along with membrane immunoglobulin and Ig-&#x003b1;/mb1, Ig-&#x003b2; is a component of the antigen receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Chicken Ig-&#x003b2; gene is specifically expressed in B lymphocytes such as DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and a project has been planned to elucidate the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of DT40-specific DHSs in B-cell-specific transcription of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene by deleting the DHSs. A total of 13 DT40-specific DHSs were mapped in the 40 kb region spanning from 19 kb upstream to 21 kb downstream from the transcriptional starting site of Ig-&#x003b2; gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Based on these results, 11 DT40-specific DHSs found in the Ig-&#x003b2; locus were divided into four regions and deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The deletion of a single region demonstrated no prominent effect on the Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA level. In this study, combinations of deletions of the four DHS regions were carried out. A marked decrease in the level of Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA was observed in cells with deletion of all four regions (All Del cells). Thus, it has been demonstrated that the collaboration of scattered regulatory regions causes a effect on the expression of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene. Examination of Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin in All Del cells showed that the collaboration of the four regions is capable of converting the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin from a condensed state to a relaxed state and enhancing H3 and H4 acetylation in the Ig-&#x003b2; gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Generation of DHS deletion mutants</title><p>DT40/Cre cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan)/10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS, USA)/1% chicken serum (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 39.5&#x000b0;C. The plasmid pLoxBsr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) containing the chicken &#x003b2;-actin promoter-driven blasticidin resistance (Bsr) gene with mutant loxP sequences at both ends was used as a targeting vector. For the targeting construct, genomic DNA of &#x0223c;2 kb in size was linked on bothsides with the actin promoter-driven Bsr gene. Preparation of the targeting constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) except for IIS Del was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Positions of left and right arms of the IIS Del constructs are as follows (the transcriptional starting site of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene is shown as base number one): IIS-L (&#x02212;4613 to &#x02212;2692; 1922 bp) and IIS-R (&#x02212;612 to +1479; 2091 bp). DT40/Cre cells were electroporated with linearized DNA and Bsr resistance clones were obtained. To determine homologous recombination, PCR was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). DT40/Cre clones with homologous recombination were treated with 0.1 mM 4-OH-tamoxifen (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for 19 h and then cloned in 96-well microtiter plates.</p></sec><sec><title>DNase I sensitivity analysis and filter hybridization</title><p>For DNase I sensitivity analysis, nuclei were prepared and treated with DNase I (Takara Bio), and restriction enzyme digestion and Southern hybridization were carried out as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).

Anti-acetylated H3 and H4 and anti-di-methylated H3K4 were obtained from Upstate Biotech (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Pol II was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA). The state of CG methylation in the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter (&#x02212;409 to +14) was examined by the bisulfite sequencing method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).

A total of 10 DHSs present between &#x02212;7.3 and +6.1 kb were divided into the following four regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): region I, having transcription-enhancing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) in the sodium channel gene (&#x02212;7.8 to &#x02212;6.0 kb; DHSs, &#x02212;7.3 and &#x02212;6.5 kb); region IIS, between the sodium channel and Ig-&#x003b2; genes (&#x02212;2.7 to &#x02212;0.6 kb; DHSs, &#x02212;2.1, &#x02212;1.5 and &#x02212;1.0 kb); region III, in the first intron of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene (+0.6 to +1.1 kb; DHS, +0.9 kb); and region IV, between the Ig-&#x003b2; and GH genes (+4.5 to +6.7 kb; DHSs, +4.8, +5.2, +5.8 and +6.1 kb). DT40 cells with a 16 kb deletion (16K Del) in one allele of the Ig-&#x003b2; locus was produced and then cells with every combination of deletions were generated. Proper deletions in all combinations were confirmed by genomic Southern hybridization (data not shown) and a representative result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Level of Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA decreases to &#x0003c;3% in cells with I-IIS-III-IV (All) DHS deletions</title><p>The level of Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA in cells with combinations of DHS deletions was examined by northern hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Changes more or less than 30% were observed in cells with a single deleted region, such as I Del (94 and 92%), IIS Del and III Del, whereas a decrease to 47 and 78% was demonstrated in cells with the region IV deletion. The level of Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA decreased to 69 and 75% in I-IV Del cells, to &#x0223c;60% in IIS&#x02013;III Del cells, and to &#x0223c;30% in III&#x02013;IV Del cells, while no prominent change was observed in I&#x02013;IIS Del and IIS&#x02013;IV Del cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and I&#x02013;III Del (93 and 93%) cells. In deletion cells with a combination of three regions, a marked decrease was observed in two combinations, such as I&#x02013;III&#x02013;IV Del (16 and 12%) and IIS&#x02013;III&#x02013;IV Del (5 and 10%), whereas a decrease to 71 and 57% was detected in I&#x02013;IIS&#x02013;IV Del cells, and no notable change was found in I&#x02013;IIS&#x02013;III Del cells (118 and 110%). A decrease was demonstrated in I&#x02013;IIS&#x02013;III&#x02013;IV (All) Del cells in which the level of Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA was &#x0003c;2 and 3% as compared with undeleted 16K Del cells. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the collaboration of scattered regulatory regions causes an effect on the expression of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene in B lymphocytes.</p><p>Although the level of Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA in cells with the region I deletion was almost the same as that in 16K Del cells, a greater decrease in the Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA level was found in I&#x02013;III&#x02013;IV Del cells (lane 10, 16 and 12%) as compared with III&#x02013;IV Del cells (lane 7, 32 and 29%). Such decrease in the Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA level was again detected in All Del cells (lane 12, &#x0003c;2 and 3%) in comparison with All minus region I Del (IIS&#x02013;III&#x02013;IV Del) cells (lane 11, 5 and 10%). Accordingly, the participation of region I in cell type-specific transcription of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene was shown to be present inside the flanking gene, as has been reported in mouse and human &#x003b2;-globin loci and the human GH locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Decrease in transcription is the reason for low level of the Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA in All Del cells</title><p>To investigate whether the decrease in the Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA level in All Del cells is at the transcriptional step, the occupancy of pol II at the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter and exon 3 was examined by ChIP analysis with anti-pol II antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As a positive control, the promoter proximal target of the Ig-J chain gene, which is transcribed equally with Ig-&#x003b2; gene in DT40 cells (data not shown), was used, while the target in the 16 kb condensed chromatin, which is located between the &#x003b2;-globin domain and the folate receptor gene, was used as a negative control because markedly low levels of H3 and H4 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) in DT40 cells had been reported at this target. Similar amounts of pol II occupied the Ig-J promoter in 16K Del, III-IV Del and All Del cells. A 13-fold enrichment as compared with the negative control was observed at the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter in 16K Del cells, while the occupancy decreased markedly to 4-fold in III-IV Del cells, and to 1.6-fold in All Del cells where the level is close to that of the negative control. At Ig-&#x003b2; exon 3, a decrease in the occupancy was again found in both deletion cells.</p><p>Total RNA from 16K Del, III-IV Del and All Del cells was analyzed by quantitative S1 nuclease protection assays with mixed probes for Ig-&#x003b2; and G3PDH mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Several protected bands due to multiple transcriptional initiation sites of the TATA box-less Ig-&#x003b2; gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) were observed. The band intensity decreased to 34 and 26% in III&#x02013;IV Del cells and &#x0003c;5% in All Del cells as compared with undeleted 16K Del cells. From these evidences, a decrease in the Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA level in All Del cells is shown to be regulated at the transcription stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene turns out to be DNase I-resistant in All Del cells</title><p>DNase I general sensitivity in the chromatin of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene in III&#x02013;IV Del and All Del cells was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Chromatin of the glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) gene, which is transcribed in all three kinds of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) including 16K Del cells, was examined as the positive control, while the chromatin in the olfactory receptor domain, which is located downstream from the &#x003b2;-globin domain, was investigated as the negative control because it had been reported as DNase I-resistant in 15-day-embryo chicken erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). In all cells, the chromatin in the olfactory receptor domain was resistant to DNase I digestion, whereas the G3PDH chromatin was DNase I-sensitive. The chromatin of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene in 16K Del cells was sensitive to DNase I. In contrast, the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin turned out to be resistant to DNase I digestion in All Del cells. Partial resistance to DNase I was observed in the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin in III&#x02013;IV Del cells. These results indicate that the collaboration of I&#x02013;IIS&#x02013;III&#x02013;IV regions is capable of converting the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin from the condensed state to a relaxed state.</p></sec><sec><title>Acetylation and H3K4 methylation at Ig-&#x003b2; promoter and exon 3 in cells with combinations of DHS deletions</title><p>The states of H3 and H4 acetylation and H3K4 di-methylation at the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter and exon 3 in cells with combinations of deletions were examined by ChIP analysis followed by real-time PCR quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In 16K Del cells, a 67-fold increase at the promoter and a 19-fold increase at exon 3 were found in H3 acetylation as compared with the condensed region flanking the &#x003b2;-globin locus where a hypoacetylation state has been reported in DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), while H3 acetylation decreased to 20% at the promoter and 40% at exon 3 in III-IV Del cells as compared with 16K Del cells. In comparison with III&#x02013;IV Del cells, a gradual decline in H3 acetylation was observed in two triple deletions. In All Del cells, H3 acetylation at the promoter and at exon 3 reached 3% of that in 16K Del cells, the same level as the Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA reduction. In H4 acetylation, the same profile as H3 acetylation was found. H4 acetylation was 8 and 4% at the promoter and at exon 3, respectively. In all cells, hyperacetylation of H3 and H4 histones was observed at the Ig-J promoter. In contrast to the decrease in H3 and H4 acetylation, there was a decrease to 56% at the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter and 2.7-fold increase at the exon 3 in H3K4 di-methylation in All Del cells. In III&#x02013;IV Del cells, 2.2-fold increase in H3K4 di-methylation at the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter was observed, while the same di-methylation state as in 16K Del cells was found at the exon 3. Thus, the collaboration of I&#x02013;IIS&#x02013;III&#x02013;IV regions is shown to participate in H3 and H4 acetylation in the promoter proximal region of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene.</p></sec><sec><title>CG methylation in the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter in cells with combinations of DHS deletions</title><p>The state of CG methylation in the promoter region of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene was examined by the bisulfite sequencing method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). All sixteen CG dinucleotides were unmethylated in 16K Del and III&#x02013;IV Del cells, whereas most CG dinucleotides except at &#x02212;409 and &#x02212;317 were methylated in kidney cells, where the Ig-&#x003b2; gene is not transcribed (data not shown). Most CG dinucleotides were unmethylated in All Del cells except for significant methylation at +12 and +14, thus indicating that the collaboration of I&#x02013;IIS&#x02013;III&#x02013;IV regions does not have an effect on hypomethylation in the region situated upstream the transcriptional start site. Although the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin becomes DNase I-resistant, and the state of H3 and H4 acetylation in the promoter proximal region decreases in All Del cells, the CG hypomethylation state in the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter is essentially the same as in 16K Del cells except at +12 and +14. This indicates that neither the DNase I general sensitive state in the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin nor hyperacetylation of H3 and H4 histones in the promoter proximal region causes CG hypomethylation in the region present upstream the transcriptional start site.</p></sec><sec><title>DHS formation in further upstream and downstream of the regions I and IV is the same but DNase I sensitivity at Ig-&#x003b2; promoter decreases in All Del cells</title><p>In addition to the DHSs deleted in this study, two DT40-specific DHSs are present in further upstream and downstream regions: one at &#x02212;13.6 kb is positioned in the intron 13 of the upstream sodium channel gene and the other is at +12.7 kb, located close to exon 4 of the downstream RDM1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Examination was carried out to determine whether III&#x02013;IV Del and All Del deletions have any effect on the formation of these DHSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, DHSs at the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter and at +10.3 kb, located at the promoter of the RDM1 gene, which is transcribed in DT40 cells and liver-derived LMH cells (data not shown), were analyzed. No difference in DHS formation at &#x02212;13.6, +10.3 and +12.7 kb was found in 16K Del, III&#x02013;IV Del and All Del cells. Thus, I&#x02013;IIS&#x02013;III&#x02013;IV regions are shown to be unnecessary for the maintenance of these DHSs. In addition, neither hyperacetylation of H3 and H4 histones in the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter proximal region nor the DNase I general sensitive state in the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin was found to be required for these DHS formations. In All Del cells, the DHS at the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter was present with a decrease in sensitivity to DNase I. Thus, chromatin parameters such as moderately sensitive DHS, enhanced H3K4 methylation and CG hypomethylation in the promoter were shown to be insufficient for optimal transcription of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene. Based on the analyses of All Del cells, a chromatin situation was found in which both an active state, such as enhanced H3K4 methylation, CG hypomethylation or moderately sensitive DHS in the promoter, and an inactive state, such as DNase I resistance of the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin or hypoacetylation of H3 and H4 histones in the Ig-&#x003b2; locus, coexist.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>On the roles of the scattered DHSs in the cell type-specific transcription of vertebrate genes, many questions remain unsolved. To solve these, the deletion effect of the cell type-specific DHSs was investigated in mouse and human &#x003b2;-globin loci and the human GH locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In any deletion, the change of DNase I general sensitivity had not been obtained so far. In this study, however, combinations of deletions of the scattered DHS regions were shown to convert the chromatin from sensitive to resistant to DNase I digestion. In transgenic mice carrying the 185 kb human &#x003b2;-globin locus, a combination of deletions of HS3 and the &#x003b2;-globin promoter causes changes in chromatin structure not only into a DNase I-resistant state but also into H3 hypoacetylation in the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). However, to convert the chromatin into a DNase I-resistant state with the DHS at the promoter intact, it would be necessary to perform combinations of deletions of the scattered DHSs in human and mouse &#x003b2;-globin loci and in the human GH locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). As was observed in this study, collaboration of cell type-specific DHSs that are found not only in and around a particular gene but also in the regions situated far upstream or downstream of the gene may participate in cell type-specific transcription in vertebrates through changes in chromatin structure including DNase I general sensitivity. It is unclear how to convert the chromatin by the collaboration of many DHSs. It is reported that scattered DHSs located in more than the 100 kb region assemble to form the active chromatin hub in the transcription of the &#x003b2;-globin gene family in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) &#x003b2;-globin loci. Perhaps the same situation is true in the chicken Ig-&#x003b2; locus. To gain further insight into how the different deleted regions might contribute to Ig-&#x003b2; gene activation, it would be useful to determine whether the lower level of Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA in the deletion mutant such as region IV result from a generalized decrease in all cells, or complete shutdown in some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>Among several parameters that determine the active chromatin state, such as (i) DNase I general sensitivity, (ii) active-type histone modifications, (iii) formation of cell type-specific DHSs, (iv) replacement of histone variant and (v) CG hypomethylation, which comes first for chromatin activation? In All Del cells, Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin turned out to be DNase I-resistant and a decrease in H3 and H4 acetylation at the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter and exon 3 was observed, whereas three parameters (H3K4 di-methylation, CG hypomethylation state in the region situated upstream the transcriptional start site, and cell type-specific DHSs in further upstream and downstream regions) were virtually unchanged. In the case of the DHS deletion that causes hypoacetylation of H3 and H4 histones in the wide range of the human GH locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), chromatin of the locus still seems to remain sensitive to DNase I, and thus the change in chromatin structure to a DNase I general sensitive state may come earlier than the hyperacetylation of core histones. Di- and tri-methylation of H3K4 is shown to be linked with active transcription in vertebrate genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In this study, a different effect of the DHS deletion on the acetylation and methylation of core histones has been demonstrated. In contrast to the decrease to &#x0003c;8% in H3 and H4 acetylation in All Del cells, H3K4 hypermethylation remained in the Ig-&#x003b2; gene. In murine &#x003b2;-globin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and GATA-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) loci, the same situations have been described in which histone acetylation is reduced without a concomitant reduction in H3K4 di-methylation. The hypomethylation state in the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter is virtually unchanged in All Del cells except for significant methylation at +12 and +14. Preventing methylation of these sites might be crucial for proper transcription of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene, or transcription may be necessary to prevent methylation. Intragenic DNA methylation has been reported to repress gene expression and to alter chromatin structure in murine erythroleukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), and then it would be interesting to determine the intragenic CG methylation of the Ig-&#x003b2; gene in All Del cells. Based on the data obtained in this study, it is still difficult to determine the changing order of chromatin parameters.</p><p>At the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter in III&#x02013;IV Del cells, H3 and H4 acetylation decreased to 20 and 40%, respectively, whereas H3K4 di-methylation showed a 2.2-fold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In place of the GATA-2 protein, the induced GATA-1 protein is reported to bind to the regulatory region present upstream of the GATA-2 gene, which is known to be one of the targets of the GATA-1 transcription factor in mouse proerythroblast-like G1E cells; binding of GATA-1 then blocks the transcription of the GATA-2 gene by disrupting positive autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). In this case, the decrease in H3 and H4 acetylation and the increase in H3K4 methylation are demonstrated at the 1G promoter of the GATA-2 gene. To explain this finding, we propose that an unidentified factor(s) increases H3 and H4 acetylation but represses H3K4 methylation at the Ig-&#x003b2; promoter through binding in the III&#x02013;IV regions, consistent with the decrease in H3 and H4 acetylation and the increase in H3K4 methylation observed in III&#x02013;IV Del cells. Detailed investigations of the proteins capable of binding to III&#x02013;IV regions should clarify whether other factor(s) are involved and may facilitate their identification.</p><p>For the maintenance of DT40-specific DHSs at &#x02212;13.6 and +12.7 kb, neither the DNase I-sensitive state in the Ig-&#x003b2; chromatin nor hyperacetylation of H3 and H4 histones is required. The presence of the so-called &#x02018;pioneer transcription factors&#x02019; such as HNF3, GATA-4 and MyoD capable of binding to compact chromatin and opening chromatin locally has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Thus, in the first step, the binding of pioneer transcription factors may cause some DHS formation in the inactive chromatin and then active-type change in chromatin structure occurs. The regions required for the maintenance of H3K4 methylation and CG hypomethylation have not been determined in this study; combinations of deletions between the &#x02212;13.6 and +12.7 kb regions and All Del regions may have an effect on these two parameters, although a single deletion of these upstream and downstream regions showed virtually no effect on the Ig-&#x003b2; mRNA level.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Frontier Project's &#x02018;Adaptation and Evolution of Extremophile&#x02019; program and Rikkyo University for the Promotion of Research.

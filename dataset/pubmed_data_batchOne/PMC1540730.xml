The latter modified base that exhibits a low ionization potential is highly susceptible to further degradation upon exposure to various oxidants. Emphasis was placed in thiswork on the formation and characterization of one-electron oxidation products of 5-hydroxyuracil within DNA fragments of defined sequence. For this purpose, 5-hydroxyuracil containing single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides of various lengths were synthesized and then exposed to the oxidizing action of iridium salts. Isodialuric acid was found to be formed almost quantitatively by a one-electron oxidation mechanism for which relevant information was inferred from a freeze-quenched ESR study. Information on the stability of isodialuric acid thus formed and its conversion products in aqueous solutions was also gained from experiments performed at acidic, neutral and alkali pH&#x02019;s. Moreover, biochemical features dealing with the substrate specificity of several bacterial and yeast base excision repair enzymes to remove isodialuric acid from site-specifically modified DNA fragments were determined.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Oxidatively generated damage to DNA bases by reactive oxygen species, which is either formed endogenously in cells during aerobic metabolism or following exposure of cells to chemical agents or radiations, can lead to cellular lethality, mutations and diseases such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Until now, &#x0223c;100 oxidized bases and nucleosides have been isolated and characterized in numerous model studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The most frequently investigated oxidized lesion is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo), a highly mutagenic nucleoside that is formed almost ubiquitously by one-electron oxidants and most of the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). 8-OxodGuo, currently used as a biomarker of DNA oxidation, is highly susceptible to further reaction with one-electron oxidants agents and singlet oxygen. 8-OxodGuo-related oxidation products and their potential biological impact, in terms of mutagenicity and repairability, havebeen extensively studied over the last decade [for a recent review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and references cited therein]. Pyrimidine-oxidation products also present a major interest and therefore have received a large attention in the recent years. Thus,cytosine is an efficient target for chemical oxidants such as KMnO<sub>4</sub>, hydroxyl radical or type I photosensitizers that produce a wide set of base lesions. Among them, 5-hydroxycytosine and, to a lesser extent, 5-hydroxyuracil (5-ohUra) are abundant degradation products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The toxicity and mutagenicity of 5-hydroxy-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (5-ohdUrd) are now well established. Indeed, mutations, mainly C&#x0003e;T transitions, are induced when the latter oxidized nucleoside is bypassed by DNA polymerases <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, proving its high miscoding feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). On the other hand 5-ohdUrd is known to be an efficient substrate for several repair enzymes, namely DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases, both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>Similar to 8-oxodGuo, 5-ohdUrd exhibits a lower oxidation potential than its unmodified initial nucleoside precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). This property suggests that oxidation of 5-ohdUrd may occur in cellular DNA even if the expected frequency of the event is low. If this is the case, it is likely that the resulting degradation products may have biological effects. Recently, Wagner and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) reported that oxidation of 5-ohdUrd by Br<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>IrBr<sub>6</sub> or type I photosensitizers exclusively generates diastereomers of 1-(2-deoxy-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro</italic>-pentofuranosyl)isodialuric acid (dIdial) as the primary degradation products. Subsequently, diastereoisomeric isodialuric acid nucleosides are converted into 1-(2-deoxy-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro</italic>-pentofuranosyl)dialuric acid (dDial), 1-(2-deoxy-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro</italic>-pentofuranosyl)-5-hydroxyhydantoin (5-ohdHyd) diastereomers and 1-(2-deoxy-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro</italic>-pentofuranosyl)-4-hydroxyimidazolidine-2,5-dione(iso-4-ohdHyd) diastereomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch1">Scheme 1</xref>). Until now, there was a paucity of information on the formation of Idial and on biochemical features of this oxidatively generated base lesion within DNA. Thus, isodialuric acid base lesion has been detected at significant levels in O<sub>s</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-treated isolated DNA, &#x003b3;-irradiated isolated DNA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The same group has reported that two <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> enzymes, Nth and Ung, as well as human Ung are able to recognize and excise isodialuric acid from oxidized isolated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Recently, Lindahl and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) provided some evidence on the toxicity of radiation-induced dIdial in the DNA of mammalian cells deficient in Smug and Ung proteins.</p><p>In this article, we report the results of a study dealing with the one-electron oxidation-mediated conversion of 5-ohdUrd residues into dIdial within synthetic single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides. The conversion of dIdial into several degradation products was also investigated in order to further establish the chemistry of the successive steps together with the stability of the resulting modified nucleosides formed within DNA strands. Pulse ESR experiments were performed using the freeze-quench approach in order to gain further insights into the mechanisms of 5-ohdUrd oxidation. Finally, information is also provided on the abilities of several prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases, involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, to remove isodialuric acid from site-specifically modified oligonucleotides.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>General procedures and materials</title><p>Na<sub>2</sub>IrCl<sub>6</sub>, &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and piperidine were obtained from Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France).

The RP-HPLC elution profile of the reaction mixture arisingfrom the oxidation of trinucleotide <bold>1</bold> by Na<sub>2</sub>IrCl<sub>6</sub> shows a quantitative conversion of the starting material, within a few minutes, giving rise to a new product eluting as a single peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The latter peak was collected and its content analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry measurements. The pseudo-molecular ion of the related modified oligonucleotide exhibits an <italic>m/z</italic> ratio 34 amu higher than that of the starting oligomer <bold>1</bold>, as determined by MALDI-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The overall data are in agreement with the formation of isodialuric acid base due to selective one-electron oxidation of the 5-ohUra residue within the oligonucleotide, following the mechanism reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch2">Scheme 2</xref>. Similar results were obtained using ESI-MS analyses of the latter oxidized oligonucleotide (data not shown). Moreover, the fragmentation pattern in the MS/MS analysis mode is indicative of an initial 18 amu mass loss from the pseudo-molecular ion, most probably as the result of a dehydration process. Indeed, isodialuric acid was shown in a previous work to be susceptible to dehydration under MS/MS analysis conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). The oxidation of <bold>1</bold> is quantitative and selective as shown by the absence of starting material or any byproducts after 1 h reaction. It is important to mention here that the presence of buffer (typically a 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7, was used) does not significantly influence the efficiency and the nature of the products formed during the present oxidation reaction, in contrast to iridium-mediated oxidation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine. In the same way, the pH dependence of the oxidation step was investigated by performing the reaction at three different pH values (pH 6, 7 and 8, respectively). The results obtained clearly show that the pH has no effect on the nature of the products formed, the isodialuric acid lesion being generated as the sole product. The only significant change observed was a higher rate of degradation of the isodialuric acid lesion at pH 8 by comparison with acidic and neutral pHs (<italic>vide infra</italic>). Similarly, oxidation of the 5-ohUra residue within ssDNA fragments <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold> leads selectively to related isodialuric acid-containing oligonucleotides, as detected by RP-HPLC analyses (data not shown). However a second product with a lower molecular weight by 18 mass units with respect to the previous one is detected by MALDI-TOF mass measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B&#x02013;D</xref>). The possibility that the second product was generated through a dehydration event was investigated by nuclease P1 and acid phosphatase treatment of oligonucleotide <bold>4</bold> oxidation mixture, in which both hydrated and dehydrated products are present in equal amounts. The resulting HPLC chromatogram shows four peaks corresponding to 2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine, 2&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine, thymidine and a product with <italic>m/z</italic> = 581 that consists of a non-digested thymine-hydrated isodialuric acid dinucleoside monophosphate (Supplementary Data). No thymine-dehydrated isodialuric acid dinucleoside monophosphate was detected at the dinucleotide level, thus confirming the predominance of the hydrated form of the base lesion within short DNA oligomers and the presence of the dehydrated species when the length of the DNA fragment increases. The two oxidation products are likely to be in a hydratation&#x02013;dehydratation equilibrium which is displaced to the hydrated form at the nucleoside level and in short single-stranded oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch2">Scheme 2</xref>). On the other hand, the percentage of the dehydrated form rises with the length of oligonucleotide. This oligonucleotide size dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) may be explained by enhanced stability of the dehydrated form in longer oligonucleotides. This equilibrium has been suggested previously in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). It is interesting to note that under our current digestion conditions, the oligonucleotide was not cleaved at the isodialuric acid site by nuclease P1, reflecting significant structural changes within the DNA molecule. Indeed, the resistance of Idial nucleoside to enzymatic digestion may be the result of structural modifications at the damaged site together with the possible sensitivity of nuclease P1 to some alterated DNA bases.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxidation of 5-ohdUrd in a double-stranded oligonucleotide</title><p>To study the oxidation of 5-ohdUrd in a double-stranded structure, the reaction was performed after hybridization of oligonucleotide <bold>4</bold> with the complementary DNA strand <bold>5</bold>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the 5-ohdUrd residue of the targeted double-stranded oligonucleotide was quantitatively converted into an overoxidized nucleoside. The modified oligomer was found to exhibit a molecular weight of 4423 amu, i.e. 16 mass units higher than that of the starting DNA fragment, as inferred from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. This may be rationalized in terms of a structure corresponding to dehydrated isodialuric acid for the oxidation product of 5-ohdUrd. This strongly suggests that the latter form of dIdial is much more stable than the hydrated one in a DNA double-helix structure. As it was observed for single-stranded oligonucleotides <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>, a quantitative oxidation of 5-ohdUrd into dIdial without the formation of any detectable side-products was found to take place within the DNA duplex. This clearly shows that the reactivity of 5-hydroxypyrimidine bases toward one-electron oxidants and the specificity of the oxidation reaction are similar, irrespective of the single- or double-stranded nature of the DNA fragment. This also indicates that isodialuric acid may be formed in isolated double-stranded DNA as a secondary oxidation product of cytosine, suggesting that it could also be generated in cellular DNA. These results underline the interest for assessing biological features and the DNA repairability of the isodialuric acid lesion.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Stability of dIdial-containing oligonucleotides</title><p>Post-synthetic preparation of isodialuric acid containing oligonucleotides has allowed the determination of the stability of the dIdial residue in 50 mM phosphate buffer at three pH values. This was achieved by RP-HPLC analysis of the solution of dIdial-containing trimer oligonucleotide <bold>1</bold> at increasing periods of time. Conversion of dIdial with time at pH 7 and 25&#x000b0;C is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Degradation of dIdial (<bold>a</bold>) leads to two products (<bold>b</bold>) and (<bold>c</bold>) after 10 h of incubation. The ESI-MS analysis of both products shows a pseudo-molecular ion at <italic>m/z</italic> of 885. By homology with a recent study performed on free dDial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), compounds <bold>b</bold> and <bold>c</bold> could be identified as DNA trimers that contain the two diastereomers of dialuric acid (dDial). After a 15 h period, dDial evolves into three other products. MS analysis of two of them, namely (<bold>d</bold>) and (<bold>e</bold>), show pseudo-molecular ion at <italic>m/z</italic> = 839 indicating that they are probably the two diastereomers of 1-(2-deoxy-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro</italic>-pentofuranosyl)-5-hydroxyhydantoin (5-ohdHyd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). It should be noticed that the structure of hydantoin diastereomeric residues needs to be further investigated. Indeed, a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) indicates that dIdial can lead not only to the hydantoins but also to 1-(2-deoxy-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro</italic>-pentofuranosyl)-4-hydroxyimidazolidine-2,5-dione (iso-4-ohdHyd), resulting from an &#x003b1;-hydroxy-ketone rearrangement. In the present case, compound <bold>d</bold> could tentatively be assigned to 5-ohdHyd diastereomers and peak <bold>e</bold> would contain the likely iso-4-ohdHyd compounds.</p><p>The last product formed, namely (<bold>f</bold>), was collected and then assigned as urea by ESI-MS measurement (<italic>m/z</italic> = 783). The presence of urea byproducts could be explained by the formation of iso-4-ohdHyd diastereomeric intermediates that undergo opening of the five-membered ring with subsequent hydrolysis of the ureid thus formed.</p><p>Degradation studies of dIdial at pH 7 and 25&#x000b0;C, have allowed determination of the half-life of the modified base, estimated at 10 h in a ssDNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The relativity fair stability of dIdial at neutral pH, that is expected to be significantly increased in the double-stranded DNA molecule, would suggest that this oxidized cytosine base would be a target for different biochemical processes such as DNA replication and transcription that are expected to give rise to potential mutagenic effects. Stability studies of Idial base within DNA oligomers show very low degradation in acidic buffer (pH 6) and a high instability in basic aqueous solutions (pH 8). Thus, 19% of dIdial was found to be decomposed after a 2 h period under the latter alkali conditions. The nature of the byproducts thus formed and the pH susceptibility are in agreement with the recently reported results on the free nucleoside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Information is also provided on the alkali-lability of dIdial-containing oligonucleotide as inferred from the results of a hot piperidine cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In this experiment, total strand cleavage was shown to occur within 30 min at the Idial site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lane 6). This has to be compared with the 60% cleavage observed at the 5-ohUra site under the same pH and time conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lane 3). Then, the latter study clearly shows the higher alkali-lability of the Idial nucleoside than its parent 5-ohdUrd nucleoside within DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>RPE analyses of one-electron oxidation of free 5-ohdUrd and proposed mechanism</title><p>As a first remark it may be pointed out that freeze-quenched samples showed a brown color reminiscent of the color of Na<sub>2</sub>IrCl<sub>6</sub> salt. Among the two different types of EPR signals, one was attributed to the Na<sub>2</sub>IrCl<sub>6</sub> salt (data not shown) by comparison with the EPR spectrum of a freeze-quenched sample containing only the iridium salt. The second EPR signal was observed at g_av = 2.0063 and exhibited a narrow (&#x0223c;20 G peak to peak) spectrum characteristic of free radicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Albeit not well resolved, the shape of the signal was dominated by the presence of a strong hyperfine coupling (<italic>a</italic> = 20 G) with an <italic>I</italic> = 1/2 nucleus and by a low g tensor anisotropy. Upon thermal annealing at 200 K for 1 min, the brown coloration of the sample disappeared and the EPR signals could no longer be detected. We conclude from these observations that the previously quenched reactions had now run to completion. EPR results are strongly indicative of the existence of at least one short-lived organic radical formed during the oxidation of 5-ohdUrd by the iridium salt. However, the chemical nature of this intermediate could not be determined unambiguously. The g_av value of 2.006 and the low g tensor anisotropy precluded the attribution of the spectrum to either an alkoxy or a peroxy radical such as <bold>C</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch2">Scheme 2</xref>), since the latter species are known to possess a g tensor principal value higher or equal to 2.03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Carbon centred radicals that exhibit typical lower g_av value and g tensor anisotropy would be better candidates. By comparison with previously studied nucleic acid components, namely thymine and isoorotic acid, a radical cation such as <bold>A</bold> would exhibit an important N1 nitrogen hyperfine coupling constant and only a very weak hydrogen hyperfine coupling constant (H6) which in fact are not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Radical <bold>B</bold> is a better candidate since it should exhibit a strong proton hyperfine coupling. For example, Close <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) determined &#x003b2; proton hyperfine couplings in a radical similar to <bold>B</bold>, derived from a thymine derivative, to be 38 G by ENDOR experiments. Unfortunately, these constants are strongly dependent on the chemical nature and local geometry of the radical centre; therefore, it was not possible to determine the exact nature of the radical intermediate. The information inferred from the EPR measurements thus provides further support for the proposed one-electron oxidation mechanism of 5-ohdUrd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch2">Scheme 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA repair studies of isodialuric acid containing oligonucleotides</title><p>The possibility to specifically generate a dIdial-containing double-stranded oligonucleotide <bold>4/5</bold>, that shows enough stability, has allowed us to study the ability of several DNA repair enzymes to excise this pyrimidine lesion. It is now well documented that BER is the major DNA repair mechanism involved in the removal of structurally non-disturbing and non-bulky lesions such as oxidized bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). BER is a multi-enzymatic pathway initiated by specific DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases that are able to remove the alterated base by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond. The hydrolytic cleavage by monofunctional DNA glycosylases leads to the release of the damaged base and the formation of an AP-site, subsequently converted to a single-strand break by an AP-endonuclease. Bifunctional DNA N-glycosylases present an associated lyase activity that catalyzes the cleavage of the DNA phosphodiester backbone via &#x003b2;&#x02013; or &#x003b2;, &#x003b4;&#x02013;elimination reactions. Only a few DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases are specific for a dedicated substrate, whereas others are able to recognize several different types of damaged nucleobases with a considerable degree of overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, the major DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases involved in the removal of oxidatively generated DNA base damage (<italic>E.coli</italic> endo III, endo VIII and Fpg together with <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Ntg1, Ntg2 and Ogg1 enzymes) were selected for the excision repair experiments. A short reaction time (15 min) was used to avoid potential degradation of isodialuric acid within the oxidized duplex <bold>4</bold>/<bold>5</bold> which would complicate data interpretation. We have shown that under the experimental conditions applied, dIdial was the predominant lesion within the DNA duplex probe since &#x0003c;5% side products, mainly dialuric acid derivatives, were detected (data not shown). As illustrated on the PAGE analysis depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, isodialuric acid is a substrate for both endo III and endo VIII proteins (lanes 3 and 4, respectively), two DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases that show high excision activities for several oxidized pyrimidine bases. These data are in agreement with a previous result obtained from repair studies using oxidized isolated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Further information on the capacity of other prokaryote DNA N-glycosylases to cope with the excision of isodialuric acid was gained from additional investigations. Thus it was shown that Fpg is able to remove isodialuric acid from <bold>4</bold>/<bold>5</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lane 2). This original result confirms recent experiments which have shown clearly that the Fpg protein has a wider specificity than initially proposed, being able to efficiently remove several ring-saturated, ring-contracted and ring-fragmented pyrimidine and purine bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Insights into the mechanisms of AP-lyase activity of the enzymes tested were gained from PAGE patterns concerning the migration of enzymatically cleaved oligonucleotides. Further confirmation of the implication of a &#x003b2;, &#x003b4;&#x02013;elimination mechanism in the repair mode of Fpg and endo VIII proteins was thus obtained. It may be reminded that cleavage products resulting from the latter pathway show a faster migration than those generated by endo III. Moreover, incubation of <bold>4</bold>/<bold>5</bold> with <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Ntg1 and Ntg2 proteins showed that isodialuric acid was efficiently removed by both eukaryote enzymes following a &#x003b2;-elimination mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). This was also the case with the monofunctionnal <italic>E.coli</italic> Ung repair enzyme which is able to excise the isodialuric acid base from single- and double-stranded DNA oligomers. This gives rise to an abasic site that may be cleaved by endonuclease IV (data not shown). The latter activity is in agreement with previous findings reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). It was also found in a recent study by Lindahl and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) that in mammalians cells, Ung and Smug are able to recognize and excise isodialuric acid. In contrast, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (lane 7), isodialuric acid is not a substrate for yOgg1 protein. This is in conformity with the much narrower substrate specificity of the yeast analog of bacterial Fpg protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Moreover, it is widely assumed that the excision activity of yOgg1 and hOgg1 proteins is highly dependent on the presence of a cytosine opposite the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). In the present experiment, the isodialuric acid lesion, an oxidized cytosine residue, was paired to a guanine residue, a situation which is not favorable to Ogg1 activity.</p><p>Finally, the presence of several DNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosylases capable of repairing the isodialuric acid lesion within prokaryotic and eucaryotic organisms highlights the biological significance and the possible impact of this type of base damage within cells. Therefore, it would be of interest in forthcoming repair studies to assess the capability of <italic>E.coli</italic>, yeast and mammalian total cell extracts to eliminate isodialuric acid and to determine which BER proteins may have relevant activity in cells. Attempts should be made to check for the possible existence of backup enzymes for the repair of Idial.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES</title><p>In this work, evidence is provided that the one-electron oxidation of 5-ohdUrd-containing oligonucleotides by iridium salts induces the formation of dIdia nucleoside with a high yield within both single- and double-stranded DNA fragments. Strikingly, the 5-ohUra lesion was found to be highly susceptible to overoxidation within DNA, confirming previous findings observed with nucleosides. Then, the specific oxidation of 5-ohUra was used to prepare, for the first time, a set of site-specific modified oligonucleotides containing the isodialuric acid base lesion. Indeed, stability studies of dIdia within the synthetic DNA oligomers show that this oxidatively generated base damage has a lifetime compatible with several biological processes that take place in cells, such as DNA replication, transcription and repair. The data thus obtained allow us to suggest that this lesion could be present <italic>in vivo</italic> and may have potential deleterious effects for cells. A search for the formation of dIdia lesions in cellular DNA is currently under investigation using the highly accurate ESI-MS technique coupled to HPLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). Further information should also be gained on biological features of Idia base damage in terms of mutagenic, toxic and lethal potential during cellular replication. One possibility to assess the mutagenic features of dIdia would be to use site-specifically modified oligonucleotides as specific probes to extend mutagenesis studies using host cells.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The contributions of Dr Serge Boiteux (CEA Fontenay-aux-Roses, France) by providing DNA repair enzymes and Colette Lebrun for ESI mass spectrometry measurements are gratefully acknowledged.

For many species, SSBs that bind to ssDNA with little or no sequence specificity have been identified, and such proteins have been identified in almost all living cells. SSBs can be divided into several classes ranging from monomeric proteins of bacteriophages such as gene-32 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) to dimeric SSBs of filamentous phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) to heterotrimeric nuclear SSBs in eukaryotes such as replication protein A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and finally to homotetrameric SSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Zeta Crystallin (ZTA1), an NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase, is a major eye lens protein in certain vertebrates such as guinea pigs and camels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) but not in others such as humans, mice or cattle. It is a soluble enzyme and is distinct from membrane-bound quinone oxidoreductase, the large complex in the respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). It is also distinct from the mammalian quinone oxidoreductase called DT-diaphorase, a flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing enzyme that catalyses NAD(P)H-dependent two-electron reduction of quinones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). ZTA1 reduces naturally occurring quinones such as 1,2-naphthoquinone and phenanthraquinone and the physiological function of ZTA1 is speculated to be detoxification or metabolism of a quinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Genes encoding ZTA1 homologues are widely distributed from bacteria to higher plants and animals and the crystal structure of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> quinone oxidoreductase/ZTA1 is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Among the mammalian zeta crystallins, the bovine ZTA1 was shown to be capable of binding to single-stranded as well as double-stranded Z-DNA which could be competed with NADPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Bovine ZTA1, also known as RF-36, was shown to play pleiotropic roles in gene expression, growth and differentiation of bovine lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). A well-characterized nucleotide-binding domain (Rossmann fold) as well as a pyridine nucleotide-binding sequence (GxxGxxG) or its variant are present in ZTA1 of all species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Genes encoding ZTA1 are reported in the genomes of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgibin/locus.pl?locus=zta1"/>) and <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ergo.integratedgenomics.com/ERGO/CGI/prot.cgi?prot=RPPA06848"/>) but the proteins are not biochemically characterized.</p><p>In the methylotrophic yeast <italic>P.pastoris</italic>, alcohol oxidase (AOX) is the first enzyme involved in the methanol metabolism. It is encoded by two methanol-inducible genes, <italic>AOX1</italic> and <italic>AOX2,</italic> of which transcription of <italic>AOX1</italic> gene is induced to very high levels by methanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Therefore, the upstream region of <italic>AOX</italic> promoter between &#x02212;735 and &#x02212;1 is widely used for heterologous expression of a number of foreign proteins in <italic>P.pastoris</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faculty.kgi.edu/cregg/index.htm"/>). Recently, a protein referred to as methanol expression regulator 1 (Mxr1p) binding to the upstream region of <italic>P.pastoris AOX1</italic> promoter was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Mxr1p binds to the <italic>AOX1</italic> upstream region between &#x02212;415 and &#x02212;172 <italic>in vitro</italic> and deletion of this region results in a significant decrease in <italic>AOX1</italic> gene expression <italic>in vivo.</italic> However, deletion of sequences outside Mxr1p-binding region in the <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter also results in a decrease in <italic>AOX1</italic> gene expression indicating the involvement of multiple regulatory circuits in <italic>AOX1</italic> gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In this study, we employed a biochemical approach to identify proteins interacting with specific upstream sequences of <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter. Such efforts have led to the isolation of an SSB which was purified and identified as the <italic>P.pastoris</italic> homologue of ZTA1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Growth of <italic>P.pastoris</italic> cells and preparation of whole cell extracts</title><p><italic>P.pastoris</italic> (GS115 strain) cells were grown overnight in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) at 30&#x000b0;C with vigorous shaking.

This region was shown to harbour multiple regulatory elements including the binding site for the recently identified transcription factor Mxr1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In this study, we first focused our attention on the sequences in the near upstream region of AOX1 promoter between &#x02212;288 and the major transcription start site (0&#x02013;115) of <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter. Oligonucletodies spanning this region were designed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and their ability to interact with proteins present in whole cell extracts of <italic>P.pastoris</italic> cells grown in YPD was examined by EMSA. Since EMSA with whole cell extracts did not yield significant results, we enriched DNA-binding proteins by heparin agarose chromatography and also generated high-specific activity <sup>32</sup>P-labelled DNA probes (Materials and Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> indicate that 229* and 288* DNA probes formed protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (E1, E2 and E3) while no significant super shift was observed with probe 174*.

Surprisingly, complex I was generated by ssDNA probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8) except 174c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 7) but not by dsDNA probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 3, 6 and 9). These results indicate that complex I is formed by an SSB protein present in the E1 fraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification and characterization of SSB from <italic>P.pastoris</italic> cell extracts</title><p>To purify the SSB present in <italic>P.pastoris</italic> cell extract, the E1 fraction was fractionated on a DEAE-Sepharose column, the flow through and 200 mM NaCl eluate fractions were analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The SSB activity was detected in the flow through fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 1) but not in the eluate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 2). UV cross-linking of DEAE flow through fraction and <sup>32</sup>P-labelled 229 DNA followed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and autoradiography lead to the identification of a radioactive band of &#x0223c;35&#x02013;40 kDa molecular weight (data not shown). Since a protein of similar molecular weight was enriched in the DEAE flow through fraction (indicated by an arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), this protein band was excised from the gel, subjected to trypsin digestion and the amino acid sequence of one of its tryptic peptides was determined. BLASTP search of this amino acid sequence (AYLSPSTFAQYTK) against the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> genome database revealed it to be homologous to a 37 kDa protein annotated as YBR046c/zeta crystallin (ZTA1) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgibin/locus.pl?locus=zta1"/>). BLASTP search of ScZTA1 amino acid sequence with the <italic>P.pastoris</italic> genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ergo.integratedgenomics.com"/>) led to the identification of a protein (ID # RPPA06848) annotated as quinone oxidoreductase. Multiple sequence alignment of amino acid sequences of ZTA1 from different species indicated that the NADPH-binding motif (AXXGXXG) present in the ZTA1 isolated from <italic>E.coli</italic> and mammalian cells is conserved in the yeast ZTA1 as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Yeast ZTA1 had &#x0223c;55% and 46&#x02013;49% homology to <italic>E.coli</italic> and mammalian ZTA1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Since the molecular weight as well as the amino acid sequence of the protein sequenced in this study was similar to that encoded by <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> YBR046c/ZTA1 and identical to that encoded by <italic>P.pastoris</italic> RPPA06848 genes, we conclude that the protein sequenced in this study is the <italic>P.pastoris</italic> homologue of <italic>E.coli</italic> and mammalian ZTA1 (PpZTA1).</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of SSB activity of recombinant PpZTA1</title><p>To examine whether PpZTA1 is an SSB, oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the Pp<italic>ZTA1</italic> nucleotide sequence and the full-length Pp<italic>ZTA1</italic> cDNA was isolated from <italic>P.pastoris</italic> cellular RNA by RT&#x02013;PCR. The cDNA was cloned into an <italic>E.coli</italic> expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and the recombinant PpZTA1 was purified as a histidine-tagged protein using Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The ability of recombinant PpZTA1 to bind ssDNA was examined by EMSA. The results indicate that the SSB properties of recombinant PpZTA1 are indistinguishable from those of the SSB purified from <italic>P.pastoris</italic> cell extracts (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). To gain further insights into the DNA-binding properties of PpZTA1, we chose 5&#x02032; end-labelled 288c and 229c ssDNA probes and annealed them to a number of short complementary oligonucleotides to generate partial duplex DNA molecules for use in EMSA as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. The results indicate that the DNA-binding activity of ZTA1 is not abolished when the 3&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 2 and 2a) or a region near the 3&#x02032; end of ssDNA molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 5 and 5a, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, v</xref>) is double-stranded. However, PpZTA1 failed to bind partial duplex DNA with double-stranded regions in the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 3 and 3a), 5&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 4 and 4a) or near the 5&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 6 and 6a). The results of EMSA are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. Dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for the interaction between recombinant PpZTA1 and three different oligonucleotides were calculated using scatchard plots and the results indicate that PpZTA1 binds 174 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>M) and 229 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>M) ssDNA probes with higher affinity than 288 ssDNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>M). To identify the minimal ssDNA region required PpZTA1 binding, short oligonucleotides of 20&#x02013;32 nt in length were designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and used in EMSA. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> indicate that PpZTA1 binds to ssDNA of 28 and 32 nt in length but not to shorter oligonucleotides. Since <italic>E.coli</italic> and mammalian ZTA1 are NADPH quinone oxidoreductases capable of binding to NADPH through the AXXGXXG nucleotide-binding motif, we examined the effect of NADPH on the SSB activity of PpZTA1. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> indicate that SSB activity of recombinant PpZTA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) is abolished in presence of NADPH but not NADH. Finally, gel filtration chromatography indicates that PpZTA1 exists as a dimer in solution since it co-elutes with albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our efforts to identify proteins interacting with the upstream sequences of <italic>P.pastoris AOX1</italic> promoter have led to the isolation of a SSB. This SSB could be identified in <italic>P.pastoris</italic> cell extracts primarily because of our strategy of radiolabelling oligonucleotides by method A as well as enrichment of DNA-binding proteins by heparin agarose chromatography. Radiolabelling of oligonucleotides by method A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) resulted in the generation of full-length as well as partially double-stranded radiolabelled DNA molecules and the latter are responsible for binding to the SSB enriched in the E1 and flow through fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> clearly demonstrate that complex I is indeed generated by an SSB present in the E1 fraction. Partial purification and sequencing of a &#x0223c;37 kDa protein enriched in the DEAE flow through fraction led to the identification of PpZTA1. Studies carried out with recombinant PpZTA1 clearly establish its identity as an SSB. Although gene sequences encoding ZTA1 have been reported for a number of organisms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=protein&#x00026;cmd=search&#x00026;term=zeta?crystallin"/>), thus far only the bovine ZTA1 was shown to have SSB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Our studies indicate that PpZTA1 is similar to bovine ZTA1 since it also binds ssDNA. In this study, we focused our attention on the DNA-binding activity of PpZTA1 using oligonucletodies of defined length and sequence since such studies have not been carried out thus far. We have also calculated the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values which are comparable with those for other well-characterized DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Of the six different single-stranded oligonucleotides examined in this study, ZTA1 binds to five of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7) but does not bind to 174c oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lane 8), which is complementary to 174. This is a very interesting observation since it demonstrates for the first time that the binding of ZTA1 to ssDNA may be sequence-specific. However, the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> does not completely support this notion. To address these issues, we are now carrying out DNA-binding studies using chimeric oligonucleotides in which specific regions in 174 ssDNA are replaced by corresponding regions in 174c ssDNA. We are also examining the ability of ZTA1 to bind to homopolymers such as poly(dA), poly(dT), poly(dC) and poly(dG). Such studies aimed at understanding the molecular mechanism of ZTA1 DNA binding will be published in a separate study.</p><p>Earlier studies on analysis of SSB of bovine ZTA1 were carried out using denatured or high molecular weight bovine lens DNA and Z-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). For the first time, we report the purification of ZTA1 based on its ability to bind to ssDNA sequences of defined length. Further, the SSB activity of PpZTA1 is abolished in presence of NADPH as observed in case of bovine ZTA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Among the mammalian ZTA1 proteins studied thus far, bovine but not guinea pig ZTA1 binds ssDNA and the theoretical pI of bovine and guinea pig ZTA1 calculated based on their amino acid sequences is 8.61 and 7.81, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). It was suggested that the increased positive charge may contribute to the high affinity of bovine ZTA1 for ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The theoretical pI of PpZTA1 calculated based on the amino acid sequence is 8.93 which is similar to that of bovine ZTA1 rather than guinea pig ZTA1. Thus, there appears to be a good correlation between the net positive charge of ZTA1 of different species and the SSB activity.</p><p>The redox potential of cells vary during the metabolism of different carbon sources and proteins which act as redox sensors as well as regulators of gene expression may play an important role in cellular homeostasis. A number of pyridine nucleotide-binding proteins possessing nucleotide-binding domains also bind nucleic acids indicating a dual role for these metabolic enzymes in enzyme catalysis as well as gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that ZTA1 may have such dual functions wherein, it not only performs catalytic function in the cytoplasm but also under conditions of reduced cytosolic NADPH levels, translocates to nucleus, bind to single-stranded regions in the promoters of genes such as <italic>AOX1</italic> and functions as a regulator of gene expression. ZTA1 is localized in cytoplasm as well as nucleus in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://yeastgfp.ucsf.edu/getOrf.php?orf=YBR046C"/>) and preliminary studies from our laboratory indicate that PpZTA1 is also localized in both these compartments (B. V. Kranthi and P. N. Rangarajan, unpublished data). It should be noted that deletion of ZTA1 results in a viable phenotype (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://db.yeastgenome.org/cgibin/phenotype/phenotype.pl?dbid=S000000250"/>) in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> indicating that the function of ZTA1 may be evident only under specific growth conditions. Identification of these growth conditions as well as characterization of the DNA sequences to which ZTA1 binds <italic>in vivo</italic> may pave way for the understanding of the physiological functions of ZTA1.</p><p>Bovine ZTA1 was originally identified as a DNA-binding protein called regulatory factor 36 (RF-36) involved in the homeotic switch concerned with adult lens gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). RF-36 was shown to bind to alpha-crystallin A-2 gene promoter region between the TATA box and transcription initiation site which possesses a Z-DNA conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Addition of bovine ZTA1 (RF-36) to <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions was shown to result in 6- to 10-fold increase in transcription of alpha-crystallin A-2 gene or purified bovine lens chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). It is speculated that mammalian ZTA1 may act as a transcriptional enhancer in the outer lens cortex by binding to Z-DNA sequences in the lens crystallin gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In the light of these observations, a role for PpZTA1 in <italic>AOX</italic> gene regulation cannot be ruled out. Finally, ZTA1 is induced by various oxidative stress treatments in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and it confers tolerance toward oxidative stress to yeast when introduced into the yeast, suggesting that the enzyme is involved in an antioxidative mechanism in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Whether PpZTA1 has a similar role during the oxidative stress induced by methanol and oleate metabolism in <italic>P.pastoris</italic> remains to be examined.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the financial support received from the Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, India.

Additional sequences for the appropriate functioning of these promoters have been proposed but not characterized, probably due to the absence of sufficient number of strong mycobacterial promoters. In the current study, we have isolated functional promoter-like sequences of mycobacteria from the pool of random DNA sequences. Based on the promoter activity in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> and score assigned by neural network promoter prediction program, we selected one of these promoter sequences, namely <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic> for characterization in order to understand the structure of housekeeping promoters of mycobacteria. <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic>&#x02013;RNAP complexes were subjected to DNase I footprinting and subsequent mutagenesis. Our results demonstrate that in addition to &#x02212;10 sequences, DNA sequence at &#x02212;35 site can also influence the activity of mycobacterial promoters by modulating the promoter recognition by RNA polymerase and subsequent formation of open complex. We also provide evidence that despite exhibiting similarities in &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 sequences, promoter regions of mycobacteria and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> differ from each other due to differences in their requirement of spacer sequences between the two positions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Success of a pathogen lies in its ability to control gene expression under varying environmental conditions. In prokaryotes gene expression is mostly regulated at the initiation of transcription. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, one of the most successful and dreaded organisms is responsible for the loss of &#x0223c;40&#x02009;000 human lives every week, globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The genome sequence of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> has revealed the presence of 13 different sigma factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>); some of these have been implicated in the control of pathogenesis of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Hence, one of the critical factors for the success of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> as a pathogen appears to be its ability for differential expression of genes required for its survival under various environmental conditions, it faces during the course of infection. Despite several elegant studies on the expression of genes in mycobacteria, we still lack a clear understanding about the structure of mycobacterial transcriptional elements.</p><p>In an earlier study, we had characterized promoter elements of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> and showed that fast growing <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> and slow growing <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG recognize mycobacterial promoters with similar efficiencies and that the basic transcriptional machineries of these mycobacterial species have common determinants of transcriptional specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Our study revealed that at &#x02212;10/extended &#x02212;10 positions the mycobacterial promoters have sequences similar to their counterparts in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>; most significantly, the mycobacterial promoters appeared to lack any other canonical sequence(s) except the Pribnow Box. However, deletion of entire promoter sequence, upstream to &#x02212;10 hexamer in a few of the mycobacterial promoters and consequent loss of their transcriptional activities (&#x0223c;90%) clearly suggested the requirement of additional upstream sequences for the optimal functioning of these promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Although, a number of mycobacterial promoters have been reported to posses <italic>E.coli</italic>-like &#x02212;35 sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), only a few of these exhibit comparable activity in both the organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). In fact, in a systematic study on the transcriptional signals of mycobacteria, we had shown that most of the mycobacterial promoters function very inefficiently in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have characterized the important regions in the housekeeping mycobacterial promoters. The availability of abundant strong promoter sequences marks the primary requirement for the characterization of important promoter regions. However, in an earlier study it was demonstrated that most of the mycobacterial promoters are weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Hence, in the current study, we first selected sequences similar to those of functional promoters of mycobacteria from a random DNA sequence library. The selection was based on the promoter activity of these DNA sequences in <italic>M.smegmatis</italic>. Out of 475 promoter clones, 40 clones exhibiting the varying promoter activities were sequenced and 26 unique clones were subsequently analyzed by using neural network promoter prediction (NNPP) program, (version 2.2) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/nnppAbst.html"/>). One of these promoter-like sequences namely <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic>, based on its high activity and score was subsequently selected for detailed characterization. Our results demonstrate that both the &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 conservations are required by mycobacterial promoters for the initiation of transcription and optimal activity. We also provide evidence for the functional differences in the promoter regions of mycobacteria and <italic>E.coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids and enzymes</title><p>In this study we used <italic>E.coli</italic> strain XL1Blue (<italic>F&#x02032;</italic>::Tn<italic>10 proA<sup>+</sup>B<sup>+</sup> lacI</italic><sup>q</sup> &#x00394;[<italic>lacZ</italic>] <italic>M15/recA1 endA1 gyrA96</italic> [Nal<sup>r</sup>] <italic>thi hsdR17</italic> [<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>r</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>k</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>m</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>k</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>] <italic>glnV44 relA1 lac</italic>), procured from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA and BL21 (DE3) pLysS (<italic>F</italic>- <italic>ompT hsdS<sub>B</sub></italic> [<inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>r</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>m</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>] <italic>gal dcm</italic> [DE3] pLysS [Cm<sup>R</sup>]), purchased from Novagen, Madison, WI, USA. <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> MC<sup>2</sup>155 (avirulent, fast growing saprophytic strain of mycobacterium) was kindly provided by Dr S.

Each of the 30 cycles was carried out at 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min, followed by final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. DNA fragments used for cloning and labeling reactions were purified by using GFX&#x02122; PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) as per the manufacturer's specifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of promoter fragments with random sequences</title><p>Promoter fragments were selected by partially annealing oligomers, oligos 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The oligo1 contained a 29 bp long random sequence, flanked by constant sequences, at its 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends. The flanking sequence at the 5&#x02032; end comprised of a partial TER3 terminator sequence of pSD5B and the flanking sequence at the 3&#x02032; end carried the sequence of coding strand of <italic>sigA</italic> gene from position &#x02212;142 to &#x02212;163 (with respect to translational start codon). The oligo2 contained the sequence of template strand of <italic>sigA</italic> gene from position &#x02212;88 to &#x02212;163 (with respect to translational start codon). Thus, these oligomers had a 22 bp long complementary sequence for hybridization. The template strand of <italic>sigA</italic> gene (in oligo2) carried mutations at positions, &#x02212;141 and &#x02212;140 (5&#x02032;-TA-3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032;-GC-3&#x02032;), which abolished inherent transcriptional activity of this sequence (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Promoter fragments used in the first round of selection were generated <italic>in vitro</italic> by hybridizing these two partially complementary oligonucleotides, oligo1 and oligo2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Oligonucleotides (1 &#x003bc;M each) were incubated in 40 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 50 mM NaCl for 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C and then annealed by slow cooling to 30&#x000b0;C for 1 h. The 3&#x02032; ends were extended with 0.5 mM dNTPs and 3 U of Sequenase DNA polymerase at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. The resulting fragments were extracted with phenol, followed by chloroform. A total of 20 randomly chosen fragments were sequenced after cloning in pGEM3Z vector at XbaI&#x02013;SphI sites; the frequency of base pairs at each position in the randomized region was approximately equal (data not shown). DNA fragments were end-labeled by PCR amplification by using a set of primers, PrF&#x02032; and oligo2, one of which (oligo2) was labeled with 10 &#x003bc;Ci [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (4000 Ci/mMol) and polynucleotide kinase, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> selection</title><p>Labeled DNA fragments (&#x0223c;0.5 &#x003bc;M) were incubated with &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;M RNA polymerase (purified from <italic>M.smegmatis</italic>, as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>)). After binding for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C, heparin was added at a final concentration of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml. After incubation for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C, RNAP-promoter complexes were separated from unbound DNA on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. These complexes were eluted by Tris&#x02013;HCl (10 mM)/EDTA (1 mM), pH 8.0 and the purified DNA was amplified by PCR by using <italic>Pfu</italic> DNA polymerase. Primers, PrF&#x02032; and oligo2 contained all non-randomized promoter positions to reduce the frequency of PCR-generated mutations that might increase promoter binding by RNAP. Amplicons were monitored on gels and the PCR was terminated at appropriate stage to avoid formation of heteroduplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). In the third and subsequent round of selection, the PCR-amplified DNA fragments from the previous round were used and the RNAP-binding reactions were carried out under progressively more stringent conditions [by reducing RNAP concentration to 0.1 &#x003bc;M after second round of binding; 10 nM after fourth round of binding and 1 nM after sixth round of binding (keeping reaction time 10 min), and reducing reaction time to 5 min after sixth round of binding and 2 min after eight round of binding (keeping RNAP concentration 1 nM)]. DNA fragments obtained in each round of selection were subsequently PCR amplified and cloned in pSD5B at its promoter cloning sites. The recombinant vectors were employed to determine the transcriptional activity of cloned DNA fragments in <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Ten rounds of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection were carried out, as after tenth round we could not monitor any complex on the gel (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of mutants</title><p>DNA fragments carrying the mutations and deletions/insertions in promoter sequences were constructed by two-step PCR amplification using overlapping modified primers, as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).

All the binding reactions were performed with PCR-amplified labeled promoter fragments as template. The DNA fragments were PCR amplified by using primers, PrF (labeled by using the [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, according to the manufacturer's specifications) and PrR (Figure 4A), resulting in a 217 bp amplicon, which contained 142 bp upstream of the TSP (+1) of <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic> and 75 bp downstream of +1 (Figure 4C).</p></sec><sec><title>DNase I footprinting</title><p>DNase I footprinting of the RNAP&#x02013;<italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic> promoter complexes was performed with 217 bp long PCR amplicon, labeled at single end as described above.

However, owing to lack of enough information about the sequence requirements by mycobacterial transcriptional machinery, we restricted the length of random nucleotides to 29 bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which represent the number of bases acquired between &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 hexameric sequences ([6 &#x000d7; 2] + 17) in other prokaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). However, the random DNA sequence library generated by us represents relatively small fraction of possible DNA sequences at the site of randomization, as compared to the one exhibiting 95% coverage (which would need enormous starting DNA material (&#x0003e;5 mM), and thus may not be experimentally feasible). Despite this caveat, as described below, we were able to select several strong transcription signals of mycobacteria.</p><p>The initial selection of strong promoter-like sequences was based on the ability of these random DNA fragments to bind with RNAP and form open complexes under varying stringencies in the presence of heparin, as described in Materials and Methods. Subsequently, by using &#x003b2;-galactosidase-based reporter plasmid the transcriptional activities of &#x0223c;475 selected DNA sequence clones were determined in <italic>M.smegmatis</italic>, which varied from &#x0223c;900 to &#x0223c;39&#x02009;000 nmol/min/mg (&#x003b2;-galactosidase activities; data not shown). For further analysis, 40 clones were selected for nucleotide sequencing which included all the clones exhibiting greater than &#x0223c;2000 nmol/min/mg activity [which represents the activity of the constitutive <italic>sigA</italic> promoter (Figure 7A)], and some clones with the promoter activity of lower than 2000 nmol/min/mg. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, 26 out of 40 clones exhibited unique sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Promoter prediction by NNPP program and sequence analysis</title><p>To define the promoter elements, the sequence of the above 26 clones was analyzed by NNPP program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/nnppAbst.html"/>). Each of the DNA sequences containing 29 bp long unique sequence, flanked by 15 bp long constant sequences, at its 5&#x02032; (5&#x02032;-TTGGATCCTTCTAGA-3&#x02032;) and 3&#x02032; (5&#x02032;-CTGTACTCGTGCGCA-3&#x02032;) ends was subjected to promoter prediction analysis. The NNPP program recognized 10 out of 26 sequences as having a definitive TSP with a score of &#x0003e;0.25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, these promoter sequences appeared to contain the conserved bases, 5&#x02032;-WTS-3&#x02032; at &#x02212;35 and 5&#x02032;-TATACT-3&#x02032; at &#x02212;10 positions, with respect to their putative TSPs and exhibited strong activities ranging from &#x0223c;3000 to 39&#x02009;000 nmol/min/mg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Promoters, <italic>A<sub>21</sub></italic>, <italic>A<sub>24</sub></italic> and <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic> also contained an extended &#x02212;10 motif. These results indicate that despite using the incomplete DNA sequence library, we were able to select a few strong promoter sequences preferred by mycobacterial RNAP. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, activities of these promoter sequences were not corresponding to the scores assigned by the program. Therefore, we selected one of the promoter sequences, <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic> for further characterization on the basis of its highest activity and the score &#x0003e;0.9, assigned by NNPP program.</p><p>To experimentally define the promoter elements of <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic>, it was subjected to primer extension analysis, which revealed that transcription from this promoter starts from a purine residue G near the position predicted by program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, the holoenzyme partially protected the sequences around &#x02212;10 position and exhibited complete protection of the bases 5&#x02032;-ACAGG-3&#x02032;, near &#x02212;35 position (from &#x02212;31 to &#x02212;27 positions).

Since the presence of TGN motif in case of mycobacteria may mask the contribution of &#x02212;35 region in the promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), we first mutated the TGN motif of <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic> and the subsequent mutations in the &#x02212;35 region were carried out with <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic>. In the preliminary studies it was observed that substituting T at position &#x02212;35 by G [<italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic>(<sub>-35</sub>T-G)], TT at positions &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;34 by GG [<italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic>(<sub>-35-34</sub>TT-GG)], and GT at positions &#x02212;33 and &#x02212;32 by CC [<italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic>(<sub>-33-32</sub>GT-CC)] resulted in a substantial reduction in the <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic> promoter activity. However, substitutions of bases at positions &#x02212;31, &#x02212;30, &#x02212;29, &#x02212;28 and &#x02212;27 (A31C30 by GG [<italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic>(<sub>-31-30</sub>AC-GG)], A29 by C [<italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic>(<sub>-29</sub>A-C)] and G28G27 by TT[<italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic>(<sub>-28-27</sub>GG-TT)]) exhibited only moderate effect on the promoter activity in <italic>M.smegmatis</italic>.

It was also observed that mutation of A residue at position &#x02212;29 exhibited no effect on the binding of RNAP (Lane 3). Hence, these results were in agreement with the <italic>in vivo</italic> activities exhibited by the mutant promoters and suggested that &#x02212;35 region of mycobacterial promoter is an important determinant of its activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of the optimal base requirement at the &#x02212;35 region</title><p>To determine if there is a sequence preference in the &#x02212;35 promoter element, we examined each position in the &#x02212;35 promoter region from positions &#x02212;35 to &#x02212;30, comparing the effect of each of the four possible nucleotides on promoter activity.

Different concentrations of RNAP were mixed with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled promoter fragments at 37&#x000b0;C to allow complex formation. The results showed concentration-dependent binding of RNAP with all the four promoter fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

In addition, majority of these sequences (47 out of 115) exhibited a distance of 18 bp between putative &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 hexamers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To analyze the effects of base substitution at &#x02212;35 position in the activity of these promoter-like sequences, we randomly selected the 5&#x02032;-UTRs of two genes, <italic>mmsA</italic> and <italic>gcvH</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The DNA sequence of each of these 5&#x02032;-UTRs encompassing the minimal promoter region from position &#x02212;35 to +10 (based on the respective putative TSPs) was cloned in pSD5B at the promoter cloning sites, XbaI and SphI and the promoter activity was determined in <italic>M.smegmatis</italic>, as described above.

By replacing the &#x02212;35 sequence by a non-identical sequence, there was a significant reduction in the activities of the respective promoters (105 nmol/min/mg by <italic>mmsA</italic> and 79 nmol/min/mg by <italic>gcvH</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These results further confirm the premise that the &#x02212;35 sequence can influence the activity of mycobacterial promoters by modulating the promoter recognition by RNA polymerase and subsequent formation of open complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of optimum distance between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 sequences of mycobacterial promoters</title><p>Although the sequences between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 regions may not directly contribute towards the specificity of recognition of promoter elements by RNAP, the placement of two sites at an appropriate distance is critical for the geometry of RNAP and subsequent recognition by RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). In order to determine the optimal intervening distance, spacer length was modulated from 15 to 19 bp (The distance between &#x02013;35 and &#x02013;10 sequences in <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub>con</italic> was 17 bp). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the distance was altered by deleting or inserting bases at the center of spacer. Moreover, we inserted random bases in the spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and observed that the effect was not sequence specific (data not shown). Promoter derivatives with 15 or 19 bp long spacer sequences exhibited a drastic reduction in their activities (1912 and 5757 nmol/min/mg, respectively) in comparison with activity of the wild-type promoter (25&#x02009;393 nmol/min/mg). Promoter derivative with 16 bp long spacer sequence exhibited significant promoter activity (11&#x02009;278 nmol/min/mg); however, the highest activity was exhibited by promoter derivative with 18 bp spacer (36&#x02009;309 nmol/min/mg).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the functional differences between mycobacterial and <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters</title><p>Since, the overall architecture of mycobacterial and <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters appeared similar, we compared the activity of one of the derivatives of <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic>, <italic>A<sub>37TG</sub></italic><sub>-</sub>(<italic>conE.coli</italic>) (which has <italic>E.coli</italic> consensus sequence 5&#x02032;-TTGACA-3&#x02032; at &#x02212;35 position with a spacer length of 16 bp) in <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic>. <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic>(<italic>conE.coli</italic>) exhibited a specific activity of 11&#x02009;623 nmol/min/mg in <italic>M.smegmatis</italic>, which was comparable with the activity of <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic> (9909 nmol/min/mg). However, contrary to our expectations, <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic>(<italic>conE.coli</italic>) exhibited only negligible activity in <italic>E.coli</italic> (85 nmol/min/mg). These observations suggested that in <italic>E.coli</italic>, in addition to &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 sequences, there might be other determinants required for promoter function, which may not be essential in mycobacteria. Recently, in a study by Liu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), it was reported that the &#x02212;15 sequence plays a crucial role in determining the strength of <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters. <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters with a consensus &#x02212;15 sequence 5&#x02032;-TTTATGTT-3&#x02032;, exhibited &#x0223c;2- to 8-fold higher activities compared to their counterparts devoid of this sequence. In order to find out whether the inability of <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub> (conE.coli)</italic> promoter derivative to support transcription in <italic>E.coli</italic> was related to the presence of GC-rich sequence in the spacer region, we replaced the sequence <sup>&#x02212;20</sup>CCCCGACG<sup>&#x02212;13</sup> by an AT-rich sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The resulting promoter derivative, <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub>(conE.coli)AT+</italic> showed &#x0223c;15-fold increased activity in <italic>E.coli</italic>, while in <italic>M.smegmatis</italic>, its activity remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These results pointed out that the sequences in the spacer region and their AT richness could be one of the determinants in differentiating between mycobacterial and <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Selection of strong transcriptional signals of mycobacteria and analysis of <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic></title><p>Although, the &#x02212;10 region of mycobacterial promoters has been clearly identified, the additional features required for transcription from these promoters have not been clearly defined. In this study, we have carried out a detailed analysis to identify what other sequences/features apart from &#x02212;10 region contribute to the activity of mycobacterial promoters. Since majority of the known housekeeping promoters of mycobacteria are weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and are unlikely to carry consensus/nearly consensus recognition sequences, we were required to generate strong promoters which bind efficiently with the RNAP of mycobacteria which was obtained by following a strategy, similar to the saturation mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). However, owing to lack of sufficient knowledge about the mycobacterial promoter elements (except the Pribnow Box), we started with background information about the promoters from other prokaryotic systems. We generated DNA sequence library harboring &#x0223c;100 bp long DNA fragments containing random sequences in a stretch of 29 bases, which represent the number of bases acquired between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 positions in a typical prokaryotic promoter (number of bases in two hexamers separated by a distance of 17 bp = [2 &#x000d7; 6] + 17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Despite using the incomplete library of DNA sequences, we were able to select a few strong promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We chose to characterize the promoter <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic> from this library based on its extremely high activity and near-perfect score.</p><p>Thorough analysis of <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic> revealed that its extremely high activity could be subscribed to cumulative effect of several features such as a purine at +1, a conserved &#x02212;10 sequence along with an extended &#x02212;10 motif. We have observed that replacing the base at +1 by any of the purine residues resulted in &#x0223c;2-fold increase in the promoter's activity in mycobacteria (N. Agarwal and A. K. Tyagi, unpublished data). In addition, we had earlier described the role of &#x02212;10 and extended &#x02212;10 sequences in mycobacterial promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In the DNase I footprinting experiments, hyperactivities of DNase I at &#x02212;24/&#x02212;25 positions of <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic> indicated overexposure of the bases to DNAse I due to the presence of RNAP. This suggests that interaction of RNAP with <italic>A<sub>37</sub></italic> may result in the generation of a favorable conformation of the promoter possibly due to bending at &#x02212;24/&#x02212;25 positions for a better binding of holoenzyme to both the &#x02212;35 and the &#x02212;10 sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the &#x02212;35 sequence for promoter functions</title><p>The reduced RNAP binding and consequently reduced promoter activity due to substitution of bases at &#x02212;35 region suggested the requirement of an optimal &#x02212;35 sequence in the activity of mycobacterial promoters. In this study we show that for the optimal activity and recognition of RNAP, a sequence at &#x02212;35 region, 5&#x02032;-TTGCGA-3&#x02032; is preferred by mycobacterial transcriptional machinery. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, most of the promoters in our library lack this consensus sequence at &#x02212;35 positions, which is probably due to incomplete DNA sequence library used for the selection of promoter-like sequences by mycobacterial RNAP. Significant changes in the activities of the promoters, <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub>, sigA, mmsA</italic> and <italic>gcvH</italic> on the substitution of their respective &#x02212;35 regions substantiated the importance of &#x02212;35 region in the activity of a mycobacterial promoter. Further evidence for the role of &#x02212;35 sequence in promoter function was provided by enhanced binding of the mycobacterial RNAP with <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub>con</italic> and <italic>sigAprocon</italic> promoter derivatives containing 5&#x02032;-TTGCGA-3&#x02032; sequence at &#x02212;35 region. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, substitutions of various individual bases at &#x02212;35 site still resulted in substantial promoter activities, indicating that mycobacterial transcriptional machinery can tolerate variety of sequences at &#x02212;35 position, as reported in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of optimum distance between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 sequences of mycobacterial promoters</title><p>The distance between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 sequences is one of the important determinants of promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Alterations in the distance between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 sequences revealed that unlike <italic>E.coli</italic> RNAP (where the optimum distance between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 sequences is 17 bp), mycobacterial enzyme requires an 18 bp long spacer sequence for optimal promoter activity. These results along with the observations that &#x0003e;40% of the putative promoter sequences in 5&#x02032;-UTRs, obtained by pattern search analysis, exhibited a distance of 18 bp between putative &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), suggest that a distance of 18 bp between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 sequences represents an optimal spacer length for mycobacterial promoters. Further support for this comes from our analysis of several known mycobacterial promoters, which revealed the presence of a spacer of 18 bp in most of the strong promoters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the functional differences between mycobacterial and <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters</title><p>Despite the similarities with <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters, the mycobacterial promoters do not function efficiently in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In the present study also, we observed that <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub>conE.coli</italic>, a derivative of <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub></italic> promoter, despite having an <italic>E.coli</italic> consensus sequence, 5&#x02032;-TTGACA-3&#x02032; at &#x02212;35 position did not exhibit significant activity in <italic>E.coli</italic>. Recently, in a study by Liu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), it was shown that the presence of GC-rich sequences in the spacer region drastically influences the strength of promoters in <italic>E.coli</italic>. This observation was further substantiated by the fact that majority of strong <italic>E.coli</italic> promoters have an AT content of &#x0003e;75&#x02013;80%. Analysis of <italic>A<sub>37TG-</sub>con E.coli</italic> promoter derivative indicated the presence of high GC content (&#x0223c;60%) in the spacer region. Hence, we replaced the GC-rich spacer sequence of this promoter (from position &#x02212;13 to &#x02212;20) by a sequence resulting in 75% AT richness in the spacer region. This enhanced AT richness resulted in 15-fold higher activity of this promoter in <italic>E.coli</italic>. However, despite this significant increase, the activity of <italic>A<sub>37</sub>TG-</italic>(<italic>conE.coli</italic>)<italic>AT+</italic> was still lower in <italic>E.coli</italic> than in mycobacterium. This could probably be due to a suboptimal distance between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;15 sequences in this promoter (8 bp) compared to the distance reported by Liu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), where it was observed that the distance between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;15 sequences is an important determinant of the promoter activity in <italic>E.coli</italic>. It has been observed by Callaci <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) that the inter-domain distance between regions 2.4 and 4.2 of <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is much shorter than the distance between &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 promoter elements. Hence, the AT-rich spacer sequence may be better suitable for appropriate binding of this region required by RNAP to establish optimal contacts with &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 hexameric sequences. Although, &#x003c3;<sup>A</sup> from mycobacteria has not been crystallized as yet, possibly, itmay have a more appropriate distance between 2.4 and 4.2 regions, thus, making it less dependent on the maneuvering of promoter region affected by bending of the spacer sequence. This may provide an explanation as to why mycobacterial promoters may function with highly GC-rich spacer regions but exhibit significantly reduced activity in <italic>E.coli</italic>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Bhavna Varshney for assistance in the mutation studies, Radhika Gupta and Ruchi Jain for critical reading of the manuscript and Rajiv Chawla for efficient secretarial assistance in the preparation of the manuscript.

Oligonucleotides were annealed and extended with Sequenase DNA polymerase to form a library of double-stranded DNA fragments carrying 29 bp long random sequence, flanked by constant sequences, at its 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends. The flanking sequence at the 5&#x02032; end comprised of a partial TER3 terminator sequence of pSD5B and the flanking sequence at the 3&#x02032; end carried the sequence of coding strand of <italic>sigA</italic> gene from position &#x02212;142 to &#x02212;163 (with respect to translational start codon). The oligo2 contained the mutant sequence (positions of mutations are marked by small asterisks) of template strand of <italic>sigA</italic> gene from position &#x02212;88 to &#x02212;163 (with respect to translational start codon). These oligonucleotides were designed in such a way that the resulting double-stranded DNA fragments contained an XbaI site upstream to random sequence and an SphI site downstream to it. The end-labeled DNA fragments were obtained by subjecting the double-stranded DNA fragment to PCR amplification by using primer PrF&#x02032; and labeled primer oligo2. Primers, PrF&#x02032; and oligo2, were designed in such a way that the amplicon carried sufficient bases (76 bases) downstream to the random sequence to ensure that the selected promoter sequences have sufficient bases downstream to the TSP. These end-labeled DNA fragments were subjected to EMSA by allowing them to form the complex with RNAP of <italic>M.smegmatis</italic>. The DNA fragments were subsequently eluted from the gel and re-amplified by PrF&#x02032; and oligo2. PCR amplicon was subsequently used for either its cloning into the pSD5B (after digestion by XbaI and SphI) or as a template for second round of PCR amplification using primer PrF&#x02032; and labeled primer oligo2. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase activity of the promoter clones was determined, as described in Materials and Methods.

Sp. represents the spacer length between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 sequences and between &#x02212;10 region and TSP, respectively. These sequences were obtained from the upstream region of various genes from different mycobacterial species: BCG, <italic>M.bovis</italic> BCG; Mfo, <italic>M.fortuitum</italic>; L5, Mycobacteriophage L5; Mtb, <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> and Msm, <italic>M.smegmatis</italic>. The promoter sequences were obtained from different sources as mentioned in corresponding references.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></back></article>

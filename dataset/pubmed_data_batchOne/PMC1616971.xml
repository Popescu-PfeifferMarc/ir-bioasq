This modification is catalyzed by TruB in bacteria and by Pus4 in eukaryotes, but so far the &#x003a8;55 synthase has not been identified in archaea. In this work, we report the ability of two distinct pseudouridine synthases from the hyperthermophilic archaeon <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> to specifically modify U55 in tRNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. These enzymes are <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5, a protein known to play a role in RNA-guided modification of rRNA, and <sub>pfu</sub>PsuX, a previously uncharacterized enzyme that is not a member of the TruB/Pus4/Cbf5 family of pseudouridine synthases. <sub>pfu</sub>PsuX is hereafter renamed <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10. Both enzymes specifically modify tRNA U55 <italic>in vitro</italic> but exhibit differences in substrate recognition. In addition, we find that in a heterologous <italic>in vivo</italic> system, <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 efficiently complements an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain deficient in the bacterial &#x003a8;55 synthase TruB. These results indicate that it is probable that <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 or <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 (or both) is responsible for the introduction of pseudouridine at U55 in tRNAs in archaea. While we cannot unequivocally assign the function from our results, both possibilities represent unexpected functions of these proteins as discussed herein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Pseudouridine (&#x003a8;) is the most abundant modified nucleoside in RNA. It has been identified in tRNAs, rRNAs, snRNAs and/or snoRNAs of all organisms that have been analyzed to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). &#x003a8; is formed post-transcriptionally by enzymatic isomerization of uridine by a class of enzymes known as pseudouridine synthases. Most &#x003a8; synthases have the ability to recognize and catalyze isomerization of one (or a few) unique target uridines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p>For many years, there were thought to be only four families of &#x003a8; synthases, corresponding to TruA, TruB, RluA and RsuA in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Members of these families were found in all three domains of life. Recently however, &#x003a8; synthases that share little sequence homology to any of these families (such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> TruD) have been found, leading to the recognition of additional groups of &#x003a8; synthases, as well as the idea that there may be many more &#x003a8; synthases that are yet to be discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>&#x003a8;55 in tRNA is a quasi-universally conserved modification found in all forms of life analyzed to date. The &#x003a8; synthases responsible for this very highly conserved modification have been identified in eukaryotes and bacteria, and are members of the TruB/Pus4/Cbf5 family [Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) 0130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>)]. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Pus4 was shown to be the enzyme responsible for this modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), and in <italic>E.coli</italic>, TruB is the enzyme responsible for formation of &#x003a8;55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Although &#x003a8;55 is known to exist in archaeal tRNAs and the activity has been identified in <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> cell extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), no archaeal &#x003a8;55 synthase has been identified to date. The goal of the present work was to identify the enzyme responsible for isomerization of U55 to &#x003a8;55 in <italic>P.furiosus</italic>, our model archaeal system. We have tested two candidate &#x003a8; synthases, <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 and <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 (previously known as PsuX).</p><p>The only identified archaeal protein within the TruB/Pus4/Cbf5 family was recently shown to function in RNA-guided pseudouridylation of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). While most &#x003a8; synthases are dedicated to modification of a single target uridine, in eukaryotes and archaea members of the Cbf5 sub-family modify multiple specific sites by a mechanism that depends on guide RNAs and a set of essential accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Thus in most eukaryotes, the paralogous proteins Pus4 and Cbf5 function in tRNA U55 and rRNA pseudouridylation, respectively. The functional complex is comprised of Cbf5 (the enzyme) plus Nop10, Gar1 and L7Ae (essential accessory proteins) and an H/ACA guide RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The guide RNA mediates substrate recognition by basepairing with nucleotides surrounding the target uridine. Multiple guide RNAs provide for pseudouridylation of numerous individual rRNA sites. Once recruited to the substrate rRNA by the guide RNA, the complex catalyzes formation of &#x003a8; at the targeted uridine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). There is no existing evidence that Cbf5 functions in the absence of a guide RNA and accessory proteins, or that Cbf5 is involved in pseudouridylation of tRNA.</p><p>The second candidate &#x003a8;55 synthase that we tested has been called PsuX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The <italic>psuX</italic> gene (hereafter the <italic>pus10</italic> gene) was identified by sequence similarity to an internal region (catalytic domain; residues G66&#x02013;A271) of the <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic> Cbf5 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Pus10 (PF1139) belongs to a different &#x003a8; synthase family than TruB, Pus4, and Cbf5 [COG 1258 for Pus10, and COG 0130 for the three other &#x003a8; synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>)] and its function and specificity are unknown.</p><p>In this work, the activities of recombinantly expressed and purified <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 and <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 enzymes were characterized and compared in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. The results indicate that both enzymes are capable of selective modification of tRNA U55 <italic>in vitro</italic> under similar reaction conditions. We found that <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 can pseudouridylate a truncated tRNA substrate (miniS) and a tRNA lacking the 3&#x02032;CCA, but that <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 functions only on the full-length tRNA substrate including the 3&#x02032;CCA end. Moreover, <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 efficiently complements tRNA &#x003a8;55 formation in an <italic>E.coli truB</italic> knockout strain. These results suggest two novel and interesting candidates for the pseudouridylation of tRNA U55 in archaea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>To construct the ML100 strain (BL21(DE3)<italic>truB</italic>), the <italic>truB</italic>2422::mini-Tn<italic>10</italic>Cm allele from strain GOB113 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) was transferred by P1 transduction into strain BL21(DE3).

The transformed cells were grown to an optical density at 660 nm of 0.5, and the expression of the protein was induced with 1 mM isopropylthio-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-galactoside (IPTG) for 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C.

The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (20&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min) and was applied to a column of Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (1 &#x000d7; 30 cm; Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni<sup>2+</sup>. The column was washed with buffer A and adsorbed material was eluted with a linear gradient (from 0 to 1 M) of imidazole in buffer A. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Fractions containing the <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 protein were pooled, concentrated to 3 mg/ml in buffer containing 1 M NaCl and 200 mM imidazole and kept at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until used.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of radiolabeled tRNA substrates</title><p>The general procedure for generating (<sup>32</sup>P) radiolabeled tRNA transcripts as substrates for enzymatic reactions is based on the method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).

The modified tRNA was then treated and analyzed for its &#x003a8; content as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). In brief, each RNA sample was hydrolyzed by nuclease P1 or RNase T2 and the resulting nucleotides were analyzed by 1D-(20 cm) or 2D-(10 cm &#x000d7; 10 cm) thin layer chromatography (TLC) on cellulose plates (Merck). First dimension was developed with solvent A (isobutyric acid/concentrated NH<sub>4</sub>OH/water; 66/1/33; v/v/v); the second dimension was developed with solvent B (concentrated HCl/isopropanol/water; 18/68/14; v/v/v). When only one dimension was performed as in Figure 3, to reduce background, the incubated tRNA was digested with RNase T1, and the fragments were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and the fragment corresponding to the T&#x003a8;-loop was extracted from the gel, eluted, ethanol precipitated and then subjected to nuclease P1 digestion and TLC, as outlined above, except using an acidic solvent for TLC (concentrated HCl/isopropanol/water; 15/70/15; v/v/v).</p></sec><sec><title>rRNA pseudouridine synthase assay</title><p>Recombinant <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 (2 &#x000b5;g) was incubated with 0.75 pmol unlabeled guide (Pf9) sRNA and 0.05 pmol [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]UTP-labeled-target rRNA as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).

To test whether these enzymes are tRNA &#x003a8;55 synthases, we cloned the <italic>P.furiosus cbf5</italic> and <italic>pus10</italic> genes, expressed and purified the <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 and <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 proteins and assayed their activity. Both enzymes catalyzed the formation of &#x003a8; <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). More extensive tests were then performed to further analyze the activity of <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 and <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10. Both enzymes were found to work under the same reaction conditions, with the optimal activity observed at 1 h at 70&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C&#x02013;F</xref>). <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 efficiently produced 1 mol of &#x003a8; for each mol of tRNA in the reaction, suggesting complete modification of a single site in the tRNA. The maximum extent of modification observed with <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 in this assay was &#x0223c;0.6 mol &#x003a8; per mole of substrate RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C and E</xref>). This limitation could reflect the sensitivity of Cbf5 to alterations in the substrate RNA or the requirement of Cbf5 for accessory proteins (see below).</p><p>We determined the sites of tRNA modification for each enzyme by performing a combination of nearest neighbor analysis and mutational analysis. Wild type <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed <sub>pfu</sub>tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> was (<sup>32</sup>P)-radiolabeled with one of the four nucleotides. The RNA was incubated with the protein under the optimal reaction conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The modified tRNA was isolated and digested with either RNase T2 or nuclease P1 as indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The resulting mononucleotides were analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (2D-TLC) followed by autoradiography. For both <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 and <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10, &#x003a8; is only detected when tRNA is either UTP-labeled and digested with nuclease P1, or CTP-labeled and digested with RNase T2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, panels 1&#x02013;4 and 9&#x02013;12 and data not shown). These results indicate that the modified uridine is 5&#x02032;-adjacent to a cytidine. This limits the modified uridine to positions 22, 35, 39, 55 and/or 60 [numbered according to yeast tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>)]. To test whether the modified uridine is formed at position 55, a U55C mutant substrate was constructed in which U55 was replaced with C55, which cannot be modified. For <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, panels 5&#x02013;6), this mutation completely abolished activity. For <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, panels 13&#x02013;14), this mutation also dramatically reduced the amount of &#x003a8; produced. The small amount of &#x003a8; seen with <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 may be owing to inefficient modification of other sites on the tRNA under the <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction conditions. These results clearly indicate that both <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 and <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 can specifically modify U55 to &#x003a8;55 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Previously, we identified U55 modification activity in a crude <italic>P.furiosus</italic> cell extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). This extract was active on both a wild-type tRNA substrate and a truncated mini-substrate (miniS) that contains only the T&#x003a8;-arm and the acceptor stem (outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). To test the ability of the two candidate proteins to act on this substrate, [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]UTP-radiolabeled transcripts of the miniS were incubated with the <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 or <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 proteins, and analyzed as described above. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> panel 7, <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 was unable to modify any uridine residue in the mini-substrate. In contrast, <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 was active on the mini-substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, panel 15).</p><p>The binding of <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 to H/ACA guide RNAs (for rRNA modification) was previously found to depend on the presence of an intact ACA sequence near the 3&#x02032; terminus of the guide RNA (box ACA) and mutations in this element prevented Cbf5 activity toward rRNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). tRNAs contain a CCA sequence at the 3&#x02032; end. To determine whether the 3&#x02032;CCA plays an important role in recognition of tRNA by <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5, we generated a tRNA that lacked the terminal CA (see dashed outline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> (panels 8 and 16), <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 did not modify the tRNA &#x02212;3&#x02032;CA mutant.

The T&#x003a8;-arm fragment consists of nucleotides 54&#x02013;65 and contains three uridines. The isolated fragment was digested with nuclease P1 and the mononucleotides were separated by single dimension TLC.

Unfortunately, because <italic>P.furiosus</italic> is not currently amenable to genetic analysis, we are unable to unequivocally determine which protein is responsible for U55 modification in this organism. Therefore we tested for the ability of the enzymes to modify tRNA U55 in a heterologous system&#x02014;an <italic>E.coli</italic> strain harboring a null allele of the <italic>truB</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).

The <italic>truB</italic> strains were transformed with plasmids containing the <italic>P.furiosus pus10</italic> or <italic>cbf5</italic> gene and the effect of the expression of each of these proteins on tRNA modification was assayed by primer extension after CMCT treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The cells were incubated for 1 h at 50&#x000b0;C [a compromise between the high temperature optimum for enzymatic activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E&#x02013;F</xref>) and optimal <italic>E.coli</italic> growth temperature]. tRNA was isolated from these cells and &#x003a8; residues within tRNA<sup>Cys</sup> and tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> were identified using the CMC/RT assay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Similar results were obtained with both tRNAs. As expected, &#x003a8;55 was observed in the wild type (wt) strain but not in the <italic>truB</italic> (KO) strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). <italic>truB</italic> cells transformed with a plasmid containing the <italic>cbf5</italic> gene showed no significant modification of U55 (data not shown), but because we were not able to detect expression of the Cbf5 protein in the <italic>E.coli</italic>, no conclusion can be drawn from the lack of activity. Nearly wild type levels of U55 modification were observed in the <italic>truB</italic> strains transformed with a plasmid containing the <italic>pus10</italic> gene (+Pus10). These results indicate that <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 can efficiently catalyze formation of tRNA &#x003a8;55 in this heterologous system.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Identification of archaeal enzymes that modify U55 in tRNA</title><p>Until the present work, no protein was attributed to the role of pseudouridylation of tRNA U55 in archaea. U55 modification activity was demonstrated in a cell-free extract of <italic>P.furiosus</italic>, but no protein was implicated as the source of the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). We have identified two archaeal proteins capable of site-specific modification of U55: <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5, the only member of the TruB/Pus4/Cbf5 family (COG 0130) found in archaea, and <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 (previously PsuX, belonging to COG 1258), which was previously uncharacterized. The evidence reported here indicates that both of these archaeal enzymes are capable of specifically performing this modification. It is possible that either or both of these proteins introduce the conserved &#x003a8;55 in tRNA in <italic>P.furiosus</italic>.</p><p>Pus10 (alias PsuX) is a previously uncharacterized enzyme. The data presented here clearly show that this enzyme can efficiently modify U55 both <italic>in vitro</italic> within a variety of substrates (wild type, &#x02212;3&#x02032;CA mutant and miniS tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>), and <italic>in vivo</italic> within <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNAs. While Pus10 is not a member of the (TruB/Pus4/Cbf5) family of &#x003a8; synthases that carry out tRNA U55 pseudouridylation in bacteria and eukaryotes, Pus10 orthologs are found in all sequenced archaeal genomes, consistent with the notion that this may be the conserved archaeal enzyme responsible for tRNA &#x003a8;55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Pus10 homologs are not present in bacteria (which employ TruB for &#x003a8;55 synthesis), but do also appear to exist in certain higher eukaryotes (which employ Pus4 for &#x003a8;55 synthesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Pus10 is renamed here as the 10th &#x003a8; synthase acting on tRNA [for review on Pus1&#x02013;9, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>)]. The implication of Pus10 in tRNA &#x003a8;55 formation (based on our findings) represents the first evidence for function of a protein outside the TruB/Pus4/Cbf5 family in introduction of this highly conserved modification.</p><p>The results of our studies indicate that <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 also catalyzes specific tRNA &#x003a8;55 formation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cbf5 is the only enzyme in archaea that bears significant sequence similarity to the known &#x003a8;55 synthases in bacteria and eukaryotes. Therefore, it is the most logical choice for the relevant enzyme. However, a role for Cbf5 in RNA-guided rRNA modification has been firmly established in archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) as well as eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Our finding that Cbf5 may also function in tRNA U55 modification suggests an unexpected dual function for Cbf5 in archaea. There is some precedent for this concept in the dual specificity of Pus1p for tRNA and U2 snRNA in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>Pseudouridylation of rRNA by Cbf5 depends upon the accessory proteins Gar1, Nop10 and L7Ae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). In this work we found that the activity of Cbf5 toward tRNA is enhanced in the presence of the accessory proteins. Thus, in both cases the relevant enzyme may be a multi-protein complex.</p><p>The dual function of archaeal Cbf5 in tRNA and rRNA modification may account for structural similarities that have been noted between components of these pseudouridylation reactions from different systems. The X-ray crystal structures of bacterial TruB and archaeal Cbf5 are remarkably similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Moreover, the structure of the regions of the substrate RNAs recognized and modified by TruB and Cbf5, the T&#x003a8;-arm of tRNA and guide RNA/rRNA duplex respectively, are strikingly comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Indeed this similarity was recently used to model the interaction between <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 and the guide RNA/rRNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Our findings suggest that <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 may also recognize a common feature of tRNAs and H/ACA guide RNAs outside the area of modification&#x02014;the CCA and ACA at the 3&#x02032; ends of tRNAs and H/ACA RNAs, respectively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>)]. These conserved structural features between tRNA and rRNA modification systems may be a consequence of the dual function of Cbf5 in both processes in archaea. Alternatively, the observed activity of Cbf5 toward tRNA may reflect general conservation between &#x003a8; synthases.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003a8;55 synthases in the three domains of life</title><p>Modification of U55 in tRNA to &#x003a8;55 occurs in all three domains of life. In bacteria, TruB is responsible for this modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In eukaryotes (with few exceptions including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) the tRNA &#x003a8;55 synthase is Pus4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The results presented here implicate Cbf5 or Pus10 (or both) as the enzyme responsible for this modification in archaea. Cbf5 also functions in H/ACA RNA-guided modification of rRNA in archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). rRNA modifications are also introduced by Cbf5 (by an RNA-guided mechanism) in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Pseudouridylation of rRNA is carried out by a set of site-specific enzymes in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Pus10 is more distantly related to these other &#x003a8; synthases.</p><p>The overall domain organization of Pus10 differs significantly from the other &#x003a8;55 synthases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Sequence analysis of Pus10 reveals the presence of several distinct domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). CXXC Zn binding motifs are found in the N-terminal region of Pus10 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). A similar motif is present in Pus1, a distinct tRNA &#x003a8; synthase in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, which contains one atom of Zn essential for the native conformation and tRNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). A THUMP domain (present in some THioUridine synthases, Methylases and Pseudouridine synthases) is located adjacent to the CXXC Zn binding motifs of Pus10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). This characteristic motif is proposed to be involved in RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). A recent study indicates that the THUMP motif alone cannot bind RNA, but facilitates the interaction of the catalytic domain of the archaeal Trm-G10 methyltransferase enzyme with tRNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The Pus10-related proteins of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> lack this THUMP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). The catalytic domain of Pus10 appears to be found in the C-terminal region of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>TruB and Cbf5 (but not Pus4 of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>) contain a characteristic PUA domain (so called because it is present in PseudoUridine synthases and Archaeosine transglycosylase) within the C-termini of the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In archaeal Cbf5, the PUA domain plays a crucial role in binding H/ACA guide RNAs [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), D. Baker, R. M. Terns and M. P. Terns, unpublished data]. This RNA binding depends on the presence of an ACA sequence at the 3&#x02032; end of the guide RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). We have found that archaeal Cbf5 also requires an intact 3&#x02032; terminal CCA sequence for activity toward tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary considerations</title><p>The observations made in this study may provide some insight on the evolutionary origin of the present-day RNA &#x003a8; synthases, especially the tRNA &#x003a8;55 synthases. The finding that in archaea Cbf5 may function in tRNA U55 pseudouridylation as well as RNA-guided pseudouridylation of rRNA supports the idea that Cbf5 is a direct descendant of a primordial TruB/Pus4-like tRNA &#x003a8; synthase. This primordial &#x003a8; synthase may have had the ability to also act on rRNA (and some dependence on guide RNAs and accessory proteins) in a common ancestor of eukaryotes and archaea. After the divergence of eukaryotes and archaea, a gene duplication in eukaryotes may have allowed separation of the functions in Cbf5 and Pus4. An analogous situation exists in the cases of the RNA-guided machinery catalyzing the formation of 2&#x02032;<italic>O</italic>-methylribose in both rRNA and tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>).</p><p>As we have indicated, our results suggest the possibility that Cbf5 and Pus10 provide redundant function in formation of the highly conserved tRNA U55 modification in archaea. Therefore it is also possible that the Pus10-related proteins present in higher eukaryotes also function redundantly in tRNA &#x003a8;55 synthesis (in this case with Pus4).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank S.

WT indicates wild-type <sub>pfu</sub>tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (panels 1&#x02013;4, 9&#x02013;12); U55C indicates U55 replacement mutant (panels 5,6,13,14); miniS indicates mini-substrate (panels 7,15) and &#x02212;3&#x02032;CA indicates 3&#x02032; terminal CA deletion (panels 8,16). See text for more details. UTP/CTP/ATP and GTP refer to the (<sup>32</sup>P)-labeled nucleotide incorporated at transcription. Incubation was for 1 h at 70&#x000b0;C in the presence of 0.12 nmol (5 &#x000b5;g) of <sub>pfu</sub>Cbf5 (panels 1&#x02013;8) and 0.01 nmol (0.5 &#x000b5;g) of <sub>pfu</sub>Pus10 (panels 9&#x02013;16). After incubation, the RNA was digested by nuclease P1 or RNase T2 (as indicated in each panel) and the resulting nucleotides were analyzed by 2D-TLC on cellulose plates and autoradiography.

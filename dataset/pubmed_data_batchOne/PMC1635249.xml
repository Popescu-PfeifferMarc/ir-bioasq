The 14 kDa protein, termed <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> transcription activator 1, Sta1, is encoded on the host chromosome. Its activating effect on transcription initiation from viral promoters was demonstrated in <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments using a reconstituted host system containing the RNA polymerase, TATA-binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor B (TFB). Most pronounced activation was observed at low concentrations of either of the two transcription factors, TBP or TFB. Sta1 was able to bind viral promoters independently of any component of the host pre-initiation complex. Two binding sites were revealed by footprinting, one located in the core promoter region and the second &#x0223c;30 bp upstream of it. Comparative modeling, NMR and circular dichroism of Sta1 indicated that the protein contained a winged helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motif, most probably involved in DNA binding. This strategy of the archaeal virus to co-opt a host cell regulator to promote transcription of its genes resembles eukaryal virus&#x02013;host relationships.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The mechanisms and regulation of gene expression in the Archaea have been studied during the past 25 years [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>)]. However, our knowledge on them remains modest in comparison to what is known on transcription in the other two domains of life, the Eukarya and Bacteria. Initial studies revealed that the archaeal basal transcription machinery resembles the core components of the eukaryal RNA polymerase (RNA Pol) II apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Through the establishment of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription systems for some archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), it became possible to identify the archaeal factors necessary for specific initiation of transcription. Consisting of only the TATA-binding protein (TBP), transcription factor B (TFB), homologous to the eukaryotic TFIIB, and the RNA polymerase, a multi-subunit enzyme, the minimal archaeal transcription pre-initiation complex appears to be a simplified version of the eukaryotic RNA Pol II system. With the ongoing genome sequencing projects many transcription regulators could be identified in archaeal genomes. Surprisingly, many of them were homologs to the members of the bacterial Lrp-like regulator family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). How regulation of an eukaryotic-like system could occur using bacterial-like regulators remains an intriguing question, mainly from an evolutionary point of view. Some of these regulators have been studied in cell-free transcription systems. Except the transcription activators Ptr2 from <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), and the homologous Lrp protein Mth from <italic>Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), these were exclusively repressors: MDR1-repressor of the ABC-transporter-gene from <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), LrpA from <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), the negatively autoregulated factor Lrs14 from <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), and Phr involved in the heat-shock response of <italic>P.furiosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). However, the physiological functions of most of these regulators are still unclear. It would appear that a majority of <italic>trans-</italic> and <italic>cis-</italic>acting regulatory transcription factors of the Archaea still remain unknown.</p><p>In a situation in which efficient genetic tools are not yet available, one possibility to study transcription regulation in hypethermophilic archaea is offered by diverse crenarchaeal virus&#x02013;host systems. Although studies on transcription of the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> virus SSV1, crucial for the identification of archaeal promoter sequences, were carried out about two decades ago, detailed analysis of transcription of viruses of hyperthermophilic crenarchaea over the replication cycle was performed only recently. <italic>In vivo</italic> transcription studies on the rudiviruses SIRV1 and SIRV2 infecting the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon <italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic> demonstrated a rather simple and barely chronological pattern of transcription, with a few cases of temporal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). SIRV promoters, similar to the host promoters, contain a TATA-box and a TFB responsive element. However, most of them contain an additional virus-specific consensus element. These observations suggested a major role for the host transcription machinery in the transcription of viral genomes, as well as possible involvement of virus-specific transcription factors.</p><p>Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of a host-encoded transcription regulator Sta1 involved in the activation of transcription from promoters of the crenarchaeal virus SIRV1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Biotinylation of promoter DNAs</title><p>Biotinylated promoter DNA used for the magnetic DNA affinity purification experiments were generated by PCR using biotinylated primers.

The system consisted of recombinant TBP and TFB as well as highly purified RNA polymerase from <italic>Sulfolobu</italic>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). As DNA templates, we used the same viral promoters that were used for affinity purification. The T6 promoter again served as a control. Although the 14 kDa protein had no effect on transcription initiation on the T6 promoter, a stimulation of transcription was observed for the viral gene promoters 56 and 134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Owing to its origin and activating effect, we term the protein <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> transcription activator, Sta1.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification and heterologous expression of the <italic>sta1</italic> gene, activating effect of the recombinant protein</title><p>For identification of the gene encoding Sta1, the protein was identified by using MALDI&#x02013;TOF mass spectrometry. It was identified as a <italic>S.islandicus</italic> homolog of the gene SSO0048 of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic>, a species closely related to <italic>S.islandicus</italic>. The putative protein encoded by this gene, owing to its predicted helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motif in the annotation of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), was presumed to be a transcription factor with homology to the <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> Lrs14 transcription regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>SSO0048</italic> gene of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> was cloned and expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in native form, as well as with a C-terminal His-tag. The recombinant protein in both forms, Sta1 and Sta1-h6, was purified to apparent homogeneity (Supplementary Figure S2).</p><p>The activity of the recombinant protein was inspected by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments using the SIRV1 gene promoter 134 as a template. To ensure that the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription start site was identical to the one <italic>in vivo</italic>, the primer extension product of the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction was analyzed together with its sequence reaction. The recombinant Sta1 was further tested in different amounts in the reconstituted transcription system with the promoter 134 as DNA template. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> demonstrate that the recombinant protein at a concentration of 0.4 &#x000b5;g/ml has the same stimulating effect on transcription as the one purified from <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells. Increasing the concentration of the recombinant Sta1 &#x0003e; 0.4 &#x000b5;g/ml no stronger stimulation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Structural analysis of Sta1</title><p>A model of the putative helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix region of Sta1 was obtained by comparative modeling and validated experimentally using NMR and CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The protein Mj233 from <italic>M.jannaschii</italic>, which is the closest homolog of Sta1 with known structure, served as a template (Materials and Methods). Mj233 forms a homodimer in which each monomer contains a winged helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix (wHTH) motif in its N-terminal region and two C-terminal &#x003b1;-helices involved in the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). The wHTH module consists of a two- or three-stranded antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet and three &#x003b1;-helices.</p><p>1D spectra (data not shown) and 2D NOESY <sup>1</sup>H NMR experiments of Sta1-h6 showed several characteristics indicating that the protein was rich in &#x003b1;-helices and contained &#x003b2;-sheets. In order to test the model, we assigned several signals of the NOESY spectra of Sta1-h6 acquired in D<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O (Supplementary Figure S3). As &#x003b2;-sheets produce well-resolved downfield-shifted NH and H&#x003b1; signals, and aromatic proton signals generally show very good dispersion, we focused on the antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet predicted by the model, which contained two tyrosine residues (Y93 and Y95) in the second strand. We identified two tyrosine spin systems with downfield-shifted NH and H&#x003b1; resonances, which indicated that the corresponding aromatic residues were located in a &#x003b2;-sheet. Remarkably, we found several NOEs implicating these tyrosine residues that were in accordance with the topology of the antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet of the model. A careful analysis of the NOESY spectra allowed us to unambiguously assign several long-range NOEs in agreement with the model between residues 51 and 95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Hence, our results showed that Sta1 had indeed a wHTH motif that resembled to that of Mj233. Of note, analysis of the NOESY spectra indicated that Sta1 did not contain any extra &#x003b2;-sheet.</p><p>Sedimentation&#x02013;diffusion equilibrium experiments performed by centrifugation indicated that, similar to Mj233 and generally, prokaryotic transcription regulators Sta1 showed a dimer&#x02013;monomer equilibrium. The dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of this equilibrium was 5 &#x000b5;M at 20&#x000b0;C. Far-UV CD spectra of Sta1 were recorded at concentrations higher than the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> to observe the dimer's CD. Once normalized, the latter was concentration independent between 20 and 100 &#x000b5;M and was dominated by contributions of &#x003b1;-helical structures (Supplementary Figure S4). As estimated by deconvolution of the CD spectrum, Sta1 contained 39% of &#x003b1;-helices and 16% of &#x003b2;-sheets. Taking into account that the content of &#x003b1;-helices of the wHTH motif (residues 30&#x02013;97) was &#x0223c;25%, the rest of the molecule (residues 1&#x02013;29 and 98&#x02013;129) should contain &#x0223c;20 residues in &#x003b1;-helices.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional analysis of Sta1</title><p>For functional studies of Sta1, the 134 promoter was chosen, as it revealed the strongest level of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In order to identify Sta1-binding sites, we employed DNase I footprinting assays on the promoter 134. Two non-sensitive regions were clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). One binding site was shown to be located in the core promoter region, the second &#x0223c;30 nt upstream of it. About 20 bp were protected in both regions at low concentrations of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Increasing the protein concentration resulted in extension of the protected areas, suggesting multiple binding. The results of the footprinting confirmed the initial observation that Sta1 was able to bind to viral promoters in the absence of other components of the transcription pre-initiation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Sta1 showed a monomer&#x02013;dimer equilibrium. To assess, which species binds DNA, we performed sedimentation/equilibrium experiments of Sta1 at 20&#x000b0;C in the presence or absence of a 30 bp oligonucleotide (Reg2), corresponding to a fragment of the protected region 2 in the footprinting experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Experiments were performed at protein concentrations above the Sta1 dimerization <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>. Sedimentation/equilibrium profiles (Supplementary Figure S5) of Reg2 alone were well-fitted by a single species with a mass corresponding to double-stranded DNA (18.4 kDa). Fitting of the Sta1 profiles showed an equilibrium of monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein, with only the dimeric form being substantially populated at 20 &#x000b5;M, the concentration used in the experiment. Importantly, the binding experiment was well described by the association of a dimer of protein with double-stranded DNA, with a dissociation constant of 10 &#x000b1; 2 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M. Hence, these results indicate that Sta1 binds to DNA as a dimer.</p><p>Considering that Sta1 binds DNA as a homodimer, its binding sites are expected to comprise inverted repeat sequences, as is the case for many transcription regulators. Imperfect palindromes detected in both the 20-bp-long protected regions are highlighted by arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>The apparent proximity of one of the binding sites of Sta1 with the TATA-box and the BRE element suggested that the activating effect of Sta1 might influence binding by the general transcription factors, TBP and/or TFB. Thus, the effect of Sta1 was studied in <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments with varying concentrations of TBP and TFB. As expected, in absence of TBP, no transcription initiation could occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the presence of low amounts of TBP, however, the activating effect of Sta1 was observed. Quantification of band intensities by phosphorimaging revealed that the strongest activation effect was observed using low amounts of TBP. Indeed, in the presence of 1 ng of TBP, transcription of promoter 134 is about five times stronger if Sta1 is added and the effect is even more dramatic (nearly 10-fold difference) in the presence of 5 ng of TBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The activating effect of Sta1 was also observed in analogous titration experiments in which the concentration of TFB was varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>The activating effect of Sta1 was also observed in analogous titration experiments in which the concentration of TFB was varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The effect of Sta1 was shown to be specific for SIRV1 promoters: transcription efficiency of the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> promoter T6 was not affected in experiments with varying concentrations of either TBP or TFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results are in line with the failure to pull-down Sta1 using the immobilized T6 promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In order to isolate proteins involved in transcription of genes of the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> virus SIRV1, DNA affinity purification experiments were conducted. With the help of three different viral promoters immobilized on magnetic beads, we isolated a 14 kDa DNA-binding protein from crude extracts of host cells. All three promoters bound to the same protein, which turned out to be encoded on the chromosome of the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> host. When we used crude extracts from virus-infected host cells in the purification experiments, the same protein was bound to all three promoters. The protein was identified as the product of the <italic>S.islandicus</italic> homolog of the gene SSO0048 from <italic>S.solfataricus</italic>, and was named Sta1.</p><p>Analysis of Sta1, either purified from host cell extracts or recombinant, showed an activating effect on transcription from two viral promoters in <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments.</p><p>Sta1 is the first archaeal transcription regulator isolated by pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) with archaeal promoters directly from cells. All other archaeal transcription regulators have been identified by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis. Our results open possibilities for the identification of unknown proteins involved in the regulation of archaeal gene expression.</p><p>Binding sites for Sta1 were determined by DNase I footprinting. Two distinct protected regions of &#x0223c;20 bp could be clearly identified. One of them was located in the core promoter region and the other was &#x0223c;30 nt upstream of it. The analysis of the protected sequences allowed us to identify the imperfect 16 bp inverted repeat which is also present in the promoter region of the SIRV1 gene 56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The alignment of the identified and putative Sta1-binding sites let us to design the consensus site as ATNT-N<sub>8</sub>-A/TNAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Location of a binding site in immediate proximity of the TATA-box and the BRE element suggested that the activating effect of Sta1 could be associated with the TBP and/or TFB, for example, by enhancing their recruitment or by stabilization of their binding. To confirm the possibility of a TBP/TFB-dependent effect, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments under suboptimal concentrations of TBP and TFB. The results demonstrated that in the presence of low amounts of one of the two factors, either TBP or TFB, Sta1 is necessary for transcription initiation from the assayed viral promoter, especially in the case of low amounts of TBP.</p><p>In general, mechanisms of transcription activation in archaea are poorly understood. Sta1 is the first transcription activator from the Crenarchaeota for which an activating effect has been directly demonstrated in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. The current knowledge on the molecular basis of transcription activation in the entire archaeal domain of life is limited to results gleaned from analysis of the recently described factor Ptr2 from <italic>M.janaschii</italic> and its Lrp ortholog from <italic>M.thermolithotrophicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Activation by Ptr2 is generated by recruitment of the TATA-binding protein to the promoter, and conveys its stimulatory effect, in contrast to Sta1, from two upstream-located binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Significantly, Sta1 is only distantly related to Ptr2 and appears to operate by distinct mechanisms from Ptr2, facilitating transcription at limiting TBP and TFB, suggesting that it belongs to a novel class of archaeal transcriptional activators.</p><p>Genomic analysis implies that Sta1 could represent a group of archaeal-specific transcription regulators. Conserved domains search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) identified an archaea-specific domain in Sta1, annotated as predicted transcription regulator (CDD 12 688). Clear homologs of Sta1, containing 120&#x02013;130 amino acids, are present on all three sequenced genomes of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> species, at least in five copies in each of them, based on an <italic>E</italic>-value threshold of 0.01. However, given the small size of the protein, additional homologs may be present but not identified as significant. Applying the same threshold, Sta1 homologs of 120&#x02013;130 amino acids were also identified in many other archaeal genomes. In contrast, BLAST searches against bacterial proteins reveal only a weak similarity to proteins of the MarR family. No evident homologs of Sta1 were found in eukaryotes.</p><p>The protein encoded by gene <italic>SSO0048</italic> was initially annotated as a putative transcription regulator with a similarity to the <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> transcriptional regulator Lrs14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) of the Lrp family. However, we showed here using NMR and homology modeling that Sta1, in contrast to the classical regulators of the Lrp family that display a HTH module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), comprises a wHTH motif with an antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet, which is absent in Lrp-like proteins. Our results, together with a BLAST search and a DALI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) search of homologous protein structures, indicated that Sta1 contained a wHTH domain similar to that of Mj233 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) and multiple antibiotic resistance proteins such as MarR, which is implicated in stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). The electrostatic potential of the model of the wHTH region of Sta1 suggested that helix H1 may be involved in hydrophobic interactions within the protein, and that the region of the molecule containing the loop between strands B1 and B2 (wing), rich in positively charged residues, the &#x003b2;-sheet as well as the so-called recognition helix (H3), are good candidates to participate in the interaction with DNA.</p><p>A strategy of the archaeal virus to implicate a host transcription regulator to promote transcription of viral genes resembles eukaryal virus&#x02013;host relationships and is in line with pronounced similarities in transcription machineries of archaea and eukarya. Numerous cases of such regulations are known in eukaryal virus&#x02013;host systems. Some examples include requirement of the host-encoded ribonucleoproteins A2/B1 and RBM3 in transcription activation of the vaccinia virus late genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>); exploitation of the cellular transcription factor USF by herpes viruses for the regulation of their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>); a presence of binding motifs for ubiquitous cellular transcriptional enhancer factors TEF-1 and TEF-2 and nuclear factor NF-1 upstream of regulatory regions of papillomaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>); and in the case of baculoviruses transcription from most early genes appears to be activated by the interaction of both, host and viral transcription factors with viral regulatory sequence elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>).</p><p>Known examples of recruitment by viruses of essential cellular regulators of different nature for the modulation of gene expression determine a considerable interest in the identification of cellular targets of Sta1. In this light, studies of gene regulation in archaeal viruses, in addition to contributing to the knowledge on diversity and evolution of molecular mechanisms of gene regulation, may provide a tool for identifying key regulators of cellular events.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.</p></sec>

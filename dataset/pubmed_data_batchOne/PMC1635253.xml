Exquisite specificity, while highly desirable, makes it imperative that the target site be first inserted at the desired genomic locale before it can be manipulated. We describe a combination of computational and experimental strategies, based on the tyrosine recombinase Flp and its target site <italic>FRT</italic>, to overcome this impediment. We document the systematic evolution of Flp variants that can utilize, in a bacterial assay, two sites from the human interleukin 10 gene, IL10, as recombination substrates. Recombination competence on an end target site is acquired via chimeric sites containing mixed sequences from <italic>FRT</italic> and the genomic locus. This is the first time that a tyrosine site-specific recombinase has been coaxed successfully to perform DNA exchange within naturally occurring sequences derived from a foreign genomic context. We demonstrate the ability of an Flp variant to mediate integration of a reporter cassette in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> via recombination at one of the IL10-derived sites.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Site-specific recombinases of the tyrosine family mediate precise DNA rearrangements between a pair of their respective cognate target sites [for a review see Refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>)]. Among more than a hundred known members of this family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), extensive biochemical and structural information is available for a small subset&#x02014;Int proteins from phages &#x003bb; and HP1, XerC/XerD from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Cre from phage P1 and Flp from the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> plasmid 2 micron circle. Tyrosine recombinases, whose name derives from the active site nucleophile utilized for DNA cleavage, follow the same reaction chemistry as type IB topoisomerases. These recombinases display conserved active site residues and similar 3D folds in their catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), features that they share with type I eukaryotic topoisomerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). At least some of the tyrosine recombinases are able to execute DNA exchange in a variety of cell types tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), certifying their potential utility in performing directed genome rearrangements: deletions, integrations, inversions and translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Development of genetic engineering tools has focused primarily on Cre and Flp, with their relatively simple substrates and reaction requirements, and to a lesser extent on &#x003bb; Int (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). A major hindrance, though, is the need to introduce beforehand the native target sites of these recombinases at the genetic loci being targeted for manipulations. Overcoming this requirement by evolving recombinase variants that act on pre-existing target-like sites in a genome will signify an important advance in biotechnology, including gene therapy.</p><p>The related structural configurations of the exquisitely sequence-specific recombinases and the relatively sequence-indifferent topoisomerases suggest the possibility of manipulating the former to recognize novel target sites without sacrificing their recombination competence. Directed evolution strategies applied to Cre and Flp proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) have produced recombinase variants with relaxed or altered target specificities. Members of the former class recombine both the native and novel targets with comparable efficiencies; those of the latter strongly favor the novel targets. In general, amino acids that directly interact with bases in the target site provide the major determinants of specificity. At the same time, amino acids that interact with the base-contacting residues, as well as those located at the monomer&#x02013;monomer interfaces and/or in proximity to the catalytic residues, also contribute to the modulation of target specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Furthermore, as revealed by structural studies on Cre variants, plasticity in DNA and protein conformations, combined with water-mediated interactions, can result in novel modes of macromolecular recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>The initial set of evolved novel specificities was limited to a single substitution or a small number of substitutions within the recombinase-binding element of the target site. Furthermore, in order to maintain symmetry, the changes were placed in each of the two binding elements that flank the strand exchange region or spacer. Despite their value as models for understanding macromolecular recognition during recombination, these sites are quite inadequate in representing target-like sites within a genome. The probability of occurrence, at a genomic locale of interest, of a dyad symmetry formed by 11&#x02013;14 bp sequence strings bracketing a 6&#x02013;8 bp spacer is extremely low. As elementary mimics for binding site asymmetry, we incorporated a distinct specificity into each half-site of the native Flp recombination target (<italic>FRT</italic>) sequence. Such a hybrid site is recombined efficiently either by a single Flp variant that is relaxed with respect to the two specificities or by a combination of two variants, each of which satisfies one of the two specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>We describe here Flp variants, obtained through a stepwise molecular evolution regimen, with recombination competence for two <italic>FRT</italic>-like (<italic>FL</italic>) sequence segments that occur naturally within the human IL10 gene (<italic>FL-IL10A or FL-IL10B</italic>). Such <italic>FL</italic> sites, with roughly the same degree of relatedness to <italic>FRT</italic>, can be identified in a genome approximately once every 10 kb. The recombination efficiency of <italic>FL-IL10A</italic> or <italic>FL-IL10B</italic> is increased significantly when its recombination partner is <italic>FRT</italic> or a hybrid site with one Flp-binding element from <italic>FRT</italic> and the other from the <italic>FL</italic> site. The present work establishes the feasibility of mediating locale-specific DNA rearrangements on a genome-wide scale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>The computer program &#x02018;TargetFinder&#x02019; for searching <italic>FRT</italic>-like genomic sequences</title><p>TargetFinder accepts a sequence file as input, and provides an output file listing the position and scores of sub-sequences similar to <italic>FRT</italic>. The scoring algorithm works by first identifying a potential 8 bp spacer within a 34 bp segment, then comparing the 13 bp (probable &#x02018;Flp-binding elements&#x02019;) flanking it on either side to the corresponding <italic>FRT</italic> sequence. A potential spacer is defined as an 8 bp string that begins with 5&#x02032;T and ends with A3&#x02032;, and has a G&#x02013;C content &#x0003c;50%. This constraint on G&#x02013;C content ensures sufficient flexibility of the spacer during the strand exchange steps corresponding to Holliday Junction formation and resolution. Under this context, the first and seventh positions of the binding element are weighted most (score = 4), followed by positions 2&#x02013;6 (score = 2) and then by positions 8&#x02013;13 (score = 1). The final score for a genomic site is estimated by multiplying its summed score by 100 and dividing by the summed score for <italic>FRT</italic>. The ranking system may be modified, as desired, by awarding merit points for consecutive matches with <italic>FRT</italic> positions and for sequences that show dyad symmetry with respect to the spacer.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> recombination assays: negative and positive screens</title><p>All <italic>in vivo</italic> recombination assays were performed in the <italic>E.coli</italic> strain DH10B from Invitrogen (<italic>F, mcrA, (mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC), &#x003d5;80dlacZM15, lacX74, deoR, recA1, endA1, ara139, D(ara, leu)7697, galU, galK, &#x003bb;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, rpsL, nupG</italic>). The assays utilized either negative or positive screening systems. The &#x02018;negative screening system&#x02019; is based on the excision and loss of a <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> reporter cassette and the resulting change in colony color from blue to white on X-gal indicator plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The &#x02018;positive screening system&#x02019; is based on the excision of the transcription terminator (from the ribosomal RNA operon <italic>rrnB</italic> of <italic>E.coli</italic>) located between a promoter and the <italic>lacZ</italic>&#x003b1; gene, causing white to blue change in colony color in presence of X-gal.</p><p>The reporters for the positive screen were constructed as follows. First, we introduced an XhoI site between the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>rrnB</italic> region and the promoter of the <italic>bla</italic>-gene of plasmid pBAD24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In the resulting plasmid, a promoterless <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> cassette from pUC18 obtained by PCR amplification (in the <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> cassette, all restriction sites in the multiple cloning sites region except EcoRI site were deleted) was inserted between HindIII and XhoI sites, thus deleting the <italic>rrnB</italic> region. This plasmid was further modified by cloning the promoter for <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic>, prepared as a PCR-amplified fragment, between NheI and NcoI sites. This plasmid derivative called pXLPB served as a template for constructing all the positive reporters used in this study. To create a positive reporter for a given pair of recombination target sites, the <italic>rrnB</italic> region from pBAD24 was PCR amplified using oligonucleotide primers harboring the appropriate sequences and then cloned between SphI and HindIII sites of pXLPB.</p></sec><sec><title>Integration assays <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>E.coli</italic></title><p>Two plasmids were constructed for the integration assays in <italic>E.coli</italic>. To construct the first, we introduced an XhoI site between the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>rrnB</italic> region and the promoter of the non-functional <italic>bla</italic>-gene in plasmid pBAD33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The plasmid thus obtained was modified by inserting the PCR-amplified promotorless <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> cassette (&#x0223c;550 bp) from pUC18 between NsiI and XhoI sites. The forward primer in the amplification step contained the sequence for the desired recombination target site ([<italic>hFRT</italic>]-[<italic>hIL10A</italic>]; Figure 6A). In the resulting plasmid pLac, the <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> gene, being promoterless cannot be expressed. To construct the partner plasmid in integration, an RFP cassette (&#x0223c;900 bp) lacking a promoter was PCR amplified from p33Rdm11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), and was inserted into pXLPB (described above) between SphI and XhoI sites to replace <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic>. The forward primer used to amplify the RFP gene contained the <italic>FL-IL10A</italic> site. The resultant construct pRFP can express RFP from the <italic>lac</italic> promoter.</p><p>Site-specific integration of pLac into pRFP was assayed by expressing the Flp variant FV7 from the inducible arabinose promoter as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Successful integration events were scored by estimating the frequency of blue colonies on X-gal indicator plates. The expected recombination reaction was verified by digesting plasmids isolated from blue and white (red under UV) colonies with XhoI.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of Flp and Flp variants: <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding and recombination reactions</title><p>The Flp protein and its variants were purified to &#x0223c;70% purity as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), and used in DNA binding and recombination assays.</p><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination assays were performed and analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Reactions contained &#x0223c;2, 4 or 8 pmol of Flp or a Flp variant per pmol of binding element of the recombination substrate.</p><p>The substrates for DNA binding, &#x0223c;200 bp long, were obtained by PCR amplification from plasmids harboring the target sites. The binding reactions were done at 30&#x000b0;C for 30 min in a modified recombination buffer that omits PEG and reduces the final glycerol concentration from 5 to 2.5%. The molar ratio of Flp or a Flp variant to binding element ranged from &#x0223c;2 to 6. The binding reactions were fractionated by electrophoresis in 1.4% agarose gels at 4&#x000b0;C under a voltage of &#x0223c;8 V/cm. DNA bands bound or unbound by protein were visualized under UV after ethidium bromide staining. Band intensities were quantified using Bio-Rad Bio-Analyst software.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA mutagenesis and shuffling</title><p>Selected amino acid positions in Flp were randomized by a PCR-based mutagenesis scheme, using primers containing the requisite degenerate positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Usually, Flp variant libraries were prepared by simultaneously randomizing two residues. Error-prone mutagenesis and DNA shuffling were done as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p><p>Mutagenic PCR was performed using <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase in a buffer that contained 0.25 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 100 nM of each primer and 100 ng of DNA template. After amplification, the DNA product was purified using PCR Clean Up Kit (Qiagen), digested with SacI and SphI, and ligated to pBAD33 digested with the same enzymes.</p><p>The procedure for DNA shuffling was as follows. DNA fragments encompassing Flp variant genes of interest were amplified using <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase under non-mutagenic conditions. A pool of the PCR product, containing equimolar amounts of each gene, was fragmented to a size range of 50&#x02013;200 bp by digestion with DNase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) [50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.4) and 10 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>; 5 min on ice]. After purification of the DNA fragments using nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen), they were shuffled and reassembled in a PCR using <italic>Pfu</italic> polymerase, without the addition of exogenous primers. The reconstruction of DNA fragments of the expected size was verified by sampling the reaction mixture by agarose gel electrophoresis. This DNA then served as template for amplification in a second PCR using a pair of synthetic primers designed to anneal just outside the Flp (variant) coding region. Depending on the purpose at hand, amplification was done under non-mutagenic or mutagenic conditions. The latter condition introduced on an average two mutations within the Flp coding region (1.3 kb). The amplified DNA was digested with SacI and SphI, and cloned into the Flp expression vector as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Other methods</title><p>The Flp&#x02013;DNA structure was analyzed using Swiss PDB Viewer 3.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Standard procedures for plasmid isolation, bacterial, restriction enzyme digestion and so on were as described in Sambrook and Russell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Logic of progressive evolution of Flp recombination specificity to native genomic sites: screening Flp variants with low recombination activity</title><p>The directed evolution strategies used in this study emulate those of Voziyanov <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) and are based on the following rationale. The first step is to identify, using a computational method, <italic>FRT</italic>-like (<italic>FL</italic>) sites in a genome that could potentially be targeted for recombination by Flp (see below). Since <italic>FL</italic> sites deviate significantly in their sequence from <italic>FRT</italic>, and are unlikely to be symmetric in their potential &#x02018;Flp-binding elements&#x02019;, two possible solutions are suggested by previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). A separate Flp variant may be evolved to satisfy each binding element specificity, and the two variants may be coexpressed to mediate recombination. Alternatively, a relaxed specificity variant may be evolved that can mediate recombination on its own. The latter strategy was followed here. Rather than attempting to macroevolve the desired specificity in a single giant step, we followed a more gradual evolutionary path guided by the &#x02018;mixed&#x02019; specificities contained within chimeric substrates constructed from <italic>FRT</italic> and an <italic>FL</italic> sequence of interest. They are referred to as <italic>FLRT</italic> sites (see below). The fraction of <italic>FRT</italic> positions replaced by <italic>FL</italic> sequences in <italic>FLRT</italic> sites increased from early to late stages of evolution.</p><p>The exchange of sequence blocks between <italic>FRT</italic> and <italic>FL</italic> in the <italic>FLRT</italic> substrates was generally guided by features of Flp&#x02013;DNA interactions inferred from footprinting assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) and observed in crystals of the Flp&#x02013;Holliday junction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The N-terminal domain of Flp interacts with the cleavage-proximal bp 1&#x02013;5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) of the binding element, with a direct contact between Lys-82 and G-1 through the major grove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The C-terminal domain interacts with DNA from the opposite side through the central major groove and the flanking minor grooves, making a direct contact between Arg-281 and G-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Lys-285 is either within hydrogen bonding (or van der Waals) distance of T-9 or is in contact with N7 of G-10, depending on whether the Flp monomer is in its catalytically active or inactive state. A number of additional contacts by both N- and C-terminal domains are possible through water-mediated networks.</p><p>Depending on the non-<italic>FRT</italic> base pair positions within a chimeric-binding element, selected amino acids, as suggested by the DNA&#x02013;protein contacts in the Flp structure, were randomized to trigger specificity modulation. After screening this first generation Flp variant libraries for the desired recombination specificity, the subset of positive individual variants was subjected to coupled mutagenesis and gene shuffling, and further screening [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>); see also Materials and Methods]. Winners from this test were processed through additional rounds of mutagenic shuffling and screening to identify the emergence of recombination competence on chimeric sites that were systematically enriched for the genomic sequences, and finally on the genomic site <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p>To cope with the suspected low recombination efficiencies at genomic sites, we devised a more sensitive genetic screen than the standard <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> deletion assay employed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In the new &#x02018;positive&#x02019; system (Materials and Methods), recombination removes a transcription terminator sequence to turn on expression of the <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> reporter. Excision of a small fraction of the terminator copies (theoretically just one copy) would suffice to display a colony as blue on X-gal indicator plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Identifying <italic>FRT</italic>-like sites in a genome</title><p>To identify <italic>FRT</italic>-like (<italic>FL</italic>) sequences within a genome, we developed the search program &#x02018;TargetFinder&#x02019;. This program divides each of the entire set of 34 bp DNA segments (the size of <italic>FRT</italic>) into two 13 bp elements flanking an 8 bp spacer (strand exchange region), and compares it base pair to base pair with <italic>FRT</italic>. TargetFinder imposes the constraint that the first and last base pair of the spacer are T-A, as in <italic>FRT</italic>, and the overall GC content of the spacer is &#x0003c;50%. Although Flp makes only two phosphate contacts and no direct base-specific contacts within the spacer, a GC rich spacer does not support efficient recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Each <italic>FL</italic> sequence is assigned a score using a weighted system that grades not all individual positions of the binding element equally (Materials and Methods). Whereas <italic>FL</italic> sequences with high scores (&#x0003e;50) are seen approximately once every 10<sup>4</sup> bp in a genome, low-scoring <italic>FL</italic> sequences (&#x0223c;30) occur roughly once every 200 bp. Two <italic>FL</italic> sequences from the human IL10 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), <italic>FL-IL10A</italic> and <italic>FL-IL10B</italic>, have scores of 60 and 54, respectively, when normalized to the <italic>FRT</italic> score of 100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). They are the targets for the directed evolution described in this study. Chimeric <italic>FLRT</italic> sites constructed by mixing <italic>FL</italic> and <italic>FRT</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) have scores intermediate between those of <italic>FL</italic> and <italic>FRT</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Relaxed specificity Flp variants that espouse <italic>FLRT</italic> chimeric sites as recombination targets</title><p>A proof-of-principle test of our evolutionary design utilized two <italic>FLRT</italic> sites derived from <italic>FL-IL10B</italic> and <italic>FRT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The choice of <italic>FL-IL10B</italic> over <italic>A</italic> was based on the presence of the critical G&#x02013;C base pair at position 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) in both binding elements of the former, but only one of the latter. However, the two sites are also related. They harbor the important G&#x02013;C base pair at position 1 in both their binding elements. In addition, they share five identities in one of their binding elements. As such, we anticipated a finite probability that the evolutionary path to <italic>FL-IL10B</italic> might also lead to <italic>FL-IL10A</italic>, either through common relaxed specificity variants or perhaps through independent variants. In <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic>, positions 1&#x02013;8 were genomic (<italic>g</italic>) sequences derived from <italic>FL-IL10B</italic>, and positions 9&#x02013;13 were from <italic>FRT</italic>; in <italic>FLRTB(1-10g)</italic>, the genomic sequence extended to position 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The 1-8<italic>g</italic> sequence differed from <italic>FRT</italic> at three positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) in one binding element of <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic>, but at four positions (2, 4, 6 and 8) in the other. The corresponding differences between <italic>FLRTB(1-10g)</italic> and <italic>FRT</italic> were four (positions 2&#x02013;4 and 10) and six (positions 2, 4, 6 and 8&#x02013;10), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Flp variants with recombination competence on <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic> and <italic>FRT</italic></title><p>In the Flp structure, Ala-55 and Ser-59 participate in a network of water-mediated contacts with the cleavage-proximal region of the Flp-binding element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In addition, Met-58 is in close proximity to Ala-55 and could potentially be involved in contacting DNA or in positioning water molecules that facilitate DNA contact. In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), we noted the presence of A55H and S59G among the amino acid changes, collectively referred to as sup3, that strongly suppress the recombination defect of a Flp variant Flp(Y60S) on <italic>FRT</italic>. Tyr-60, which is conserved among Flp related yeast tyrosine recombinases, makes a cleavage-proximal contact with a spacer phosphate on the non-cleaved strand opposite the scissile phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). When transplanted into the wild-type background, position 60 being held as tyrosine, the sup3 group of 10 mutations (listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) confers relaxed specificity towards native (<italic>FRT</italic>) and two mutated target sites (<italic>mFRT</italic>s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Since one of the binding elements of <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic> differs from that of <italic>FRT</italic> only at three consecutive cleavage-proximal base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), we suspected that individual or combinatorial changes at amino acids 55, 58 and 59, in conjunction with other accessory mutations, will likely accommodate <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic> specificity. Two of the four differences present in the second binding element of <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic> lie within the cleavage-proximal bp 1&#x02013;5 (positions 2 and 4), and two are more distal (positions 6 and 8). In principle, a relaxed specificity Flp variant may recombine <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic> by being indifferent to the asymmetry in the binding elements; alternatively, binding cooperativity between two protein monomers may override the asymmetry.</p><p>Because of the proclivity of sup3 mutations to relax Flp specificity, pairwise randomization of residues 55, 58 and 59 were carried out in Flp<sup>sup3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Of the three separate libraries so obtained, the one with randomized 55&#x02013;58 pair yielded several variants that were able to recombine <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic>. After randomizing amino acid 59 in this sub-library, its members, together with the wild-type <italic>FLP</italic> gene, were carried through mutagenic shuffling and re-screened by the above test. Four positive variants FV1-4 were identified thus; their mutation profiles are tabulated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. The accuracy of the recombination events performed by them was verified by SphI digestion of plasmids isolated from white and blue colonies obtained in the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right). One of the variants, FV3, was also characterized by <italic>in vitro</italic> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and recombination assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As was suspected, these variants were relaxed in their specificity towards <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic> and <italic>FRT</italic>.</p><p>Consistent with their origin, FV4 retained 9 out of the 10 mutations that constitute the sup3 group and FV1-3 retained 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The lack of retention was at the randomized positions 55 and 59. All four variants harbored A55S rather than A55H of Flp<sup>sup3</sup>, whereas FV1-3 additionally contained a switch from S59G of Flp<sup>sup3</sup> to S59N. FV1-4 had also acquired M58V (a randomized position) and S130P (acquired during mutagenic shuffling). There was a single additional mutation in FV2 (F182S), three such mutations in FV1 (R17C; S193G; A349T) and FV3 (M44V; S234I; T312A), and four in FV4 (M44V; V280I; A349T; T373A). Although the structural basis for the common specificity of FV1-4 on <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic> is unknown, the locations of a subset of the mutations they harbor (S193G in FV1, F182S in FV2, S234I and T312A in FV3 and A349T in FV4) are well suited for potentially altering phosphate and base contacts or interactions involving some of the catalytic residues.</p></sec><sec><title>Two Flp variants that utilize <italic>FLRTB(1-10g)</italic> and <italic>FL-IL10A</italic> as recombination targets</title><p>Since the non-identities between <italic>FLRTB(1-10g)</italic> and <italic>FRT</italic> include position 10 in one binding element and positions 9 and 10 in the other, a <italic>FLP</italic> library randomized at the codon for Lys-285 (which is within hydrogen bonding distance of T-9 or G-10) was shuffled, under mutagenic conditions, with genes of variants that recombine <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic>. Those variants that showed recombination on <italic>FLRTB(1-10g)</italic> in the positive screen were reshuffled in efforts to improve recombination efficiency. Among the final crop of variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), FV5 and FV6 gave low to modest recombination (3 and 15% blue colonies, respectively); FV7 and FV8 were significantly more efficient (both &#x0223c;80% blue colonies). Not surprisingly, FV7 and FV8 were active on <italic>FRT</italic> as well, yielding nearly 100% recombination (blue colonies) in the positive system and &#x0223c;5 and 10% recombination (white colonies), respectively, in the negative system (data not shown). When tested against the genomic sites, both variants showed respectable recombination activity on <italic>FL-IL10A</italic> (&#x0223c;60% blue colonies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The activity on <italic>FL-IL10B</italic>, though detectable, was quite weak (&#x0223c;0.1%). Thus, by adapting Flp stepwise to chimeric sites, its recombination specificity can be sufficiently relaxed to render a true genomic sequence an acceptable target. There was only one amino acid difference, at position 193, between FV7 and FV8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The very similar activity patterns of the two proteins on the different substrates tested is therefore not surprising.</p><p>In contrast to FV7 and FV8, wild-type Flp yielded virtually no recombination or extremely poor recombination when a genomic site was offered as the substrate (&#x0003c;0.001% with <italic>FL-IL10B</italic> and &#x0223c;0.1% with <italic>FL-IL10A</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The recombination activity of Flp<sup>sup3</sup> was nearly undetectable on <italic>FL-IL10B</italic> (&#x0003c;0.001%), and quite weak on <italic>FL-IL10A</italic> (1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This result is consistent with the previous observation that Flp<sup>sup3</sup> is partially relaxed in its specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>The predicted recombination events, converting the reporter plasmid P to the shortened form R, were checked by SphI digestion of plasmid DNA isolated from a random set of blue colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The band running just above P in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> was consistent with either a recombination event from a dimer form of the parent plasmid or the insertion of the excised circle into a parent monomer. This inference was verified by digestion with SphI plus HindIII, whose target sequences bracket the DNA segment harboring the <italic>rrnB</italic> terminator and the flanking recombination sites. The SphI&#x02013;HindIII fragment carrying a second inserted copy of the <italic>rrnB</italic> terminator would be &#x0223c;1000 bp long. Indeed, a band of this size (X) was detected in digests of the plasmid mixture corresponding to lanes 3 and 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4).</p></sec><sec><title>Recombination efficiency of genomic sites can be enhanced by cooperative effects of <italic>FRT</italic> specificity</title><p>Because of the ability of FV7 and FV8 to utilize <italic>FRT</italic> with superior efficiency than the genomic sites, the recombination potential of <italic>FL-IL10A</italic>, and in particular that of <italic>FL-IL10B</italic>, could be improved by providing either one of these an <italic>FRT</italic> site with a matching spacer as the recombination partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Similarly, FV7- or FV8-mediated recombination between <italic>FL-IL10B</italic> and a hybrid site [h<italic>FRT</italic>]-[h<italic>FL-IL10B</italic>], containing one binding element from <italic>FL-IL10B</italic> and the other from <italic>FRT</italic> (see the <italic>IL10B2</italic> reporter configuration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), was much more efficient than that between two copies of <italic>FL-IL10B</italic>. The &#x02018;h&#x02019; in the hybrid site refers to a half-site. In contrast, wild-type Flp yielded no recombination or poor recombination when a genomic site was partnered with <italic>FRT</italic> or with a hybrid site. Similarly, the recombination activity of Flp<sup>sup3</sup> was nearly undetectable (&#x0003c;0.001%) when one of the recombination partners of the reporter cassette was <italic>FL-IL10B</italic> (the <italic>IL10B2</italic> or <italic>IL10B3</italic> cassettes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, it showed significantly improved recombination (20%) when <italic>FL-IL10A</italic> was paired with <italic>FRT</italic> (the <italic>IL10A3</italic> cassette in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

One of the plasmid substrates for recombination pLac contained a promoterless <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> cassette, whereas the second one pRFP contained the RFP (red fluorescent protein) gene expressed from the upstream Lac promoter. As a result, colonies harboring them were white (or faintly red) under visible light, but distinctly red under UV light. Plasmids pLac and pRFP were compatible with each other, as the former contained the ColE1 replication origin and the latter the p15a origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The [h<italic>FRT</italic>]&#x02013;[h<italic>FL-IL10A</italic>] hybrid site was placed upstream of the <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> gene and the native <italic>FL-IL10A</italic> site upstream of the RFP gene. Thus, the <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic>-containing plasmid mimicked transfected foreign DNA, whereas the RFP-containing plasmid approximated genomic DNA. The FV7 expression plasmid, harboring the R1 replication origin, was introduced into the experimental strain by transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Following P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter-driven induction of F7V, &#x0223c;45% of the colonies were blue, indicating expression of <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic> by acquisition of the Lac promoter via integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The authenticity of the recombination event was confirmed by XhoI digestion of plasmids isolated from randomly picked white and blue colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Among the white colonies, only the parental reporter plasmids were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Among blue colonies, the majority contained the fusion plasmid alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;6), whereas a smaller number contained the parent plasmids as well as the fusion plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;8).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have demonstrated the evolution of two closely related Flp variants that mediate recombination at a native site derived from the human <italic>IL10</italic> gene. A second site within <italic>IL10</italic> serves as a weaker substrate. The choice of these sites as potential recombination targets is based on their organizational and sequence similarities to <italic>FRT</italic>, as reported by the search program TargetFinder. The evolved variants retain <italic>FRT</italic> specificity, which is stronger than its acquired specificity. As discussed below, this dual specificity offers an important technical advantage in targeted integration or replacement of foreign or resident sequences, respectively, in a genomic context.</p><p>The integrase from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> phage &#x003c6;C31, a serine family site-specific recombinase, has been found to be useful for genetic manipulations in mammalian cells. Normally, the enzyme mediates integrative recombination between phage and bacterial attachment sites, <italic>attP</italic> and <italic>attB</italic>, respectively. However, it can also promote recombination between a plasmid harboring <italic>attB</italic> and certain native sequences in mammalian genomes that resemble <italic>attP</italic>, referred to as pseudo <italic>attP</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). By directed evolution, it has been possible to generate integrase variants that preferentially target one such pseudo <italic>attP</italic> site present on human chromosome 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). There is a significant difference between this &#x003c6;C31 integrase variant and the Flp variant FV7 obtained by us in their specificity attributes. What has been accomplished with the former is to obtain &#x0223c;2.5-fold higher preference and recombination efficiency for a site that the wild-type integrase also recognizes as a target for recombination. In contrast, the genomic sequence FL-IL10A that FV7 utilizes as recombination substrate is not a target, or an extremely poor target for wild-type Flp; it is discriminated against by two to three orders of magnitude relative to FRT.</p><p>An alternative approach to applying a recombinase enzyme for genome engineering is to attach to it a &#x02018;tunable&#x02019; specificity module in order to direct it to a particular genomic target site. Following this logic, Akopian <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) fused the DNA recognition domain from the mouse transcription factor Zif268 to a relaxed specificity variant of Tn3 resolvase. They demonstrated that this hybrid recombinase can act at a locale that contains the cognate DNA sequence for the transcription factor. A related strategy for promoting directed gene replacement is to stimulate homologous recombination at desired genomic locales by introducing double-strand DNA breaks with the help of zinc finger nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>).</p><p>In principle, the ability to construct designer recombinases either by directed evolution or by incorporation of specificity domains will significantly expand their role in biotechnological applications. Together with nucleases that serve as site-specific stimulators of homologous recombination, the novel specificity recombinases will provide the capacity of manipulating large genomes at multiple locales within a single cell.</p><sec><title>The logic of evolving novel recombination potential through relaxation of specificity</title><p>Since genomic <italic>FL</italic> sites have multiple differences from <italic>FRT</italic> in their &#x02018;Flp-binding&#x02019; elements and almost certainly lack binding site symmetry, evolution of unique specificity to such a site would be tremendously challenging. More plausible is the relaxation of Flp specificity that permits recombination of an <italic>FL</italic> site, albeit at a low level, without accompanying loss of native specificity. Based on this logic, the template for directed evolution is the gene for Flp<sup>sup3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), already relaxed towards <italic>FRT</italic> and two of its mutant derivatives (<italic>mFRT</italic>s), each containing a symmetric single base pair change in the binding elements. The evolutionary steps, dictated by the features of Flp&#x02013;DNA interactions, involve (i) targeted randomization of specific residues, (ii) iterative shuffling of gene libraries under mutagenic conditions, and (iii) low and high sensitivity screens for recombination events. The adaptive drive is provided by chimeric sites that diverge in steps from <italic>FRT</italic> towards <italic>FL</italic>.</p><p>Although evolution was directed to <italic>IL10B</italic> specificity, it led to better recombination efficiency on <italic>IL10A</italic>. This outcome is consistent with (i) the sequence relatedness between the two <italic>FL</italic> sites in one of the binding elements, (ii) cooperative interactions between Flp monomers during recombination, and (iii) relaxation being the source of the new specificity. The potential to generate specificity to more than one closely related genomic <italic>FL</italic> sites is a bonus of the evolutionary design.</p></sec><sec><title>Advantages of relaxed specificity in genetic engineering</title><p>Absent the capability to design or evolve a unique specificity recombinase variant with recombination competence on a native genomic sequence, a relaxed specificity variant has finite advantages in accomplishing directed genetic rearrangements. As is evident from the present findings, the <italic>FRT</italic> specificity preserved in FV7 can be exploited in the form of a hybrid site or as a partner site to enhance the recombination potential at <italic>FL</italic> sites such as <italic>FL-IL10A</italic> and <italic>FL-IL10B</italic>. This cooperativity assisted augmentation of FV7 permits successful DNA integration by recombination at <italic>FL</italic> sites in a bacterial host. Indeed, targeted integration and replacement would be among the most prominent applications of a designer recombinase enzyme. The probability that relaxed specificity will give rise to degenerate recombination events and undesirable rearrangements is essentially nil. Since successful recombination requires absolute homology between the 8 bp spacers of recombination partners, the design of the spacer sequence can impose exquisite target selectivity even when the recombinase specificity encompasses more than one genomic <italic>FL</italic> site. Consistent with this idea, the several recombination events that we have analyzed in the <italic>E.coli</italic> system have not revealed aberrant reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Future prospects</title><p>Using the Flp recombinase as a model system, we have demonstrated here the feasibility of obtaining recombination competence on native genomic sequences by coupling a structure-based evolutionary strategy with mutagenic DNA shuffling. In principle, a similar strategy can be utilized to generate a library of variants whose recombination specificities span a large number of genomic target sites. It is possible that not every one of these sites will work in its natural context due to potential masking effects of chromatin organization. Even so, being able to direct integration events at multiple locales within a large genome would be an important advance in bioengineering.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Andrew Ellington for helpful discussions.

The set of mutations present in Flp<sup>sup3</sup> are listed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The subset of the sup3 mutations that were retained in the Flp variants that recombine <italic>FLRTB(1-8g)</italic> is denoted by sup3* (A35T, I45V, T50A, E150G, K173R, I295F, T324I, I367L). The recombination activity of a variant in the negative system (deletion of <italic>lacZ</italic>&#x003b1;) was expressed as the percentage of white colonies on X-gal plates. Plasmids isolated from randomly picked white colonies (w) were digested with SphI to verify authentic recombination. Representative results in lanes 2&#x02013;5 correspond to FV1&#x02013;FV4, respectively. Lane 1 shows the digestion result for a blue colony (b) from the FV1 assay.

Recombination assays were done using the positive system (expression of <italic>lacZ&#x003b1;</italic>), and the activity of each variant was expressed as the percent of blue colonies on X-gal plates. Plasmids isolated from a random set of blue colonies (b) were digested with SphI to verify the predicted deletion event. Typical results for FV5&#x02013;FV7 are shown in lanes 2&#x02013;4, respectively. The result for a white colony (w) obtained with FV7 is shown in lane 1. P and R refer to the parental plasmid and the larger of the two deletion products, respectively. The band at the top denotes the expression plasmid (EP). The extra band above P in lanes 2&#x02013;4 was either the product of the excision reaction from a plasmid dimer or resulted from insertion of the excised <italic>rrnB</italic> circle into a parental monomer plasmid.

Plasmids isolated from blue (b) or white (w) colonies were digested with SphI. Only the results for FV7 are shown. The reporter substrates are indicated above the respective lanes. Recombination on FL-IL10B was quite weak but detectable. (<bold>C</bold>) Plasmid mixtures corresponding to lanes 3 and 4 of (A) were digested with SphI plus HindIII (lanes 3 and 4), and fractionated with similarly digested Flp expression plasmid (EP) (lane 1) and the parent reporter plasmid (P).

The size of the band marked &#x02018;X&#x02019; agrees with it containing two copies of <italic>rrnB</italic> and three copies of the recombination target site. This is the expected configuration for an intermolecular recombination event that inserts a copy of the excised <italic>rrnB</italic> circle into the parent reporter plasmid.

Transcription of the rRNA gene is initiated by the assembly of RNA polymerase I and a defined set of transcription factors at the rRNA gene promoter to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The nucleation of these factors at the promoter requires a complex network of protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;DNA interactions. Upstream binding factor (UBF) is an HMG box-containing factor that binds to the rRNA gene promoter and is responsible for the recruitment of the species-specific selectivity factor 1 (SL1). SL1 is a complex composed of TBP and three TBP-associated factors (TAFs), TAF<sub>I</sub>48, TAF<sub>I</sub>63 and TAF<sub>I</sub>110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Studies using a cell-free system indicated that SL1 binds directly to UBF and is brought to the promoter by specific protein interaction between two of its subunits, TBP and TAF<sub>I</sub>48, and UBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The formation of the UBF&#x02013;SL1 complex at the rRNA gene promoter promotes the recruitment of the RNA polymerase I enzyme, which occurs via interactions between UBF and Pol I, and between SL1 and the bridging factor Rrn3 (also termed TIF-IA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The assembly of the PIC and the transition from a closed to an open complex leads to promoter clearance and transcription elongation. As RNA polymerase I moves away from the promoter, a new Pol I/Rrn3 complex would then be recruited through interactions with the promoter-bound UBF&#x02013;SL1 complex. Based on this model, a stable UBF&#x02013;SL1 complex at the rRNA gene promoter would support high rates of rRNA synthesis by promoting multiple rounds of transcription initiation. Although the key role of UBF in nucleating the PIC at the rRNA promoter has been recently challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), recent <italic>in vivo</italic> data have clearly demonstrated that SL1 and Pol I are recruited to chromatin through protein interactions with UBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>The activity of UBF is regulated by posttranslational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation. CBP-dependent acetylation of UBF stimulates Pol I transcription by counteracting the inhibitory effect of pRb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and a recent study has shown that acetylation of UBF stimulates its interaction with Pol I, suggesting that the acetylation status of UBF influences the assembly of the PIC at the rRNA promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>In addition to acetylation, the activity of UBF is regulated by phosphorylation. Metabolic labeling studies of cultured mammalian cells demonstrated that UBF is phosphorylated under normal growth condition and both UBF phosphorylation and RNA polymerase I transcription increase upon serum stimulation of quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The critical function of phosphorylation in the regulation of UBF activity has been demonstrated in several studies. SV40 large T antigen, a viral oncogenic protein that promotes cell growth, stimulates Pol I transcription by recruiting to the rRNA gene promoter a cellular kinase that phosphorylates UBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Pol I transcriptional activity during the progression of the cell cycle is modulated, at least in part, by phosphorylation of UBF by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)&#x02013;cyclin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Reversible UBF phosphorylation of two N-terminal HMG boxes by ERK plays an important role in stimulation of rRNA gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Collectively, these studies provide compelling evidence for the important role that phosphorylation of UBF plays in the regulation of Pol I transcription. Phosphorylation of UBF has been shown to affect its DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) and its interaction with other components of the transcriptional apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). By employing <italic>in vitro</italic> protein&#x02013;protein interaction and DNase I footprinting assays we have shown that the phosphorylation status of UBF plays a key role in modulating the interaction between UBF and SL1 and in the recruitment of SL1 to the promoter elements of the rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Moreover, mitogen-induced phosphorylation of UBF has been shown to promote its association with TBP, one of the SL1 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). However, the amino acid residues in UBF whose phosphorylation is necessary for SL1 binding and the cellular kinase responsible for their phosphorylation remain to be identified. The C-terminal region of UBF is particularly rich in phosphorylation sites for the protein kinase CK2, a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase involved in cell growth, proliferation and survival, and kinase assays with purified factors have shown that UBF is phosphorylated by CK2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). CK2 is composed of two catalytic &#x003b1; and/or &#x003b1;&#x02032; subunits, and two regulatory &#x003b2; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Genetic studies in yeast and mammalian cells have indicated that CK2 is required for cell viability and for cell to progress through the cell cycle. CK2 is thought to participate in a wide array of cellular processes as a growing number of physiological targets for CK2 have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Notably, a number of recent studies have also shown that CK2 directly regulates RNA polymerase II and III transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p><p>In this study we examined the role of CK2 in the regulation of Pol I transcription. Our data indicate that CK2 is physically associated with the RNA polymerase I/Rrn3 complex and is present at the promoter region of the rRNA genes. Studies with a CK2-specific inhibitor and reconstituted transcription assays demonstrate that CK2 activity influences Pol I transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cultured cells. Importantly, our results indicate that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of UBF counteract the negative effect of HMG boxes five and six and stabilizes the interaction of this factor with SL1, thus promoting multiple rounds of Pol I transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>HEK293, HEK293T and normal diploid human fibroblast were cultured in DMEM media containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 C.

The finding that CK2 cofractionates with the Pol I/Rrn3 complex but not with UBF and SL1 was confirmed in chromatographic fractionation of nucleolar extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which contain a population of proteins primarily involved in the transcription and processing of rRNA. To determine whether the subpopulation of CK2 that copurifies with the Pol I/Rrn3 complex is physically associated with this complex, the fraction isolated from the nuclear extracts that contains the Pol I/Rrn3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 4) was then subjected to an immunoprecipitation reaction with anti-CK2&#x003b1; antibody. The results of this experiment show that Pol I and Rrn3 co-immunoprecipitate with CK2&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 5) but not with an unrelated nuclear protein (TAF<sub>II</sub>32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 6), indicating that at least a fraction of cellular CK2 is bound to the Pol I/Rrn3 complex.</p><p>To investigate the relevance of this interaction in Pol I transcription, we then determined whether CK2 is recruited to the rDNA sequences <italic>in vivo</italic>. The association of CK2 with the rDNA was examined in ChIP assays using sets of primers specific for the promoter, the coding (18S RNA) and the termination regions of the rRNA genes. We found that Pol I (&#x003b2;&#x02032; subunit) and UBF are associated with all three regions of the rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). CK2&#x003b1; is also present at the rRNA gene promoter but in contrast to Pol I and UBF, it is not detected at the transcribed and the termination regions, suggesting that this kinase may play a specific role in initiation of Pol I transcription. Moreover, if CK2 is recruited to the promoter via interactions with the Pol I/Rrn3 complex, the absence of detectable CK2 at the coding and termination regions suggest that CK2, like Rrn3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), is released from the polymerase upon transcription elongation.</p></sec><sec><title>CK2 kinase activity is required for Pol I transcription in cultured cells and <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To determine whether the kinase activity of CK2 plays a role in the regulation of Pol I transcription, 293 cells were incubated with 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB), a specific inhibitor of CK2 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), or DMSO (vehicle) for either 1, 2 or 4 h, and the endogenous level of 45S pre-rRNA was determined by nuclease S1 protection assay or by reverse transcriptase RT&#x02013;PCR. Since the probe and primers used in these assays detect the extreme 5&#x02032; end of the external transcribed sequence of the rRNA precursor, which is rapidly processed in the cell, these assays primarily measure the rate of transcription initiation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, both assays indicate that the addition of TBB causes a sharp decrease in Pol I transcription (upper panel, lanes 2, 3, 5 and 7; lower panel, lanes 2&#x02013;4). The concentrations of TBB used in this assay inhibit CK2 activity &#x0223c;80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). In contrast, the level of a control mRNA (GAPDH) is not affected by TBB (lower panel, lanes 2&#x02013;4). A similar level of inhibition of Pol I transcription by TBB was also observed in studies carried out with human primary fibroblasts (data not shown). In a complementary set of experiments, we compared Pol I transcriptional activity in nuclear extract prepared from TBB- and DMSO-treated 293 cells using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays with an rDNA reporter construct. The results of these experiments indicate that nuclear extracts prepared from TBB-treated cells have &#x0223c;2-fold lower Pol I transcriptional activity than nuclear extracts prepared from DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), providing additional evidence that CK2 kinase activity is required for optimal Pol I transcription. In addition, these data suggest that inhibition of CK2 activity likely influences the activity of one or more transcription factor. To investigate further the direct requirement for CK2 activity in Pol I transcription, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted transcription assays with purified Pol I/Rrn3 fraction, which contains CK2, SL1 and recombinant UBF. A western blot analysis of the purified proteins is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (lanes 2&#x02013;4). The partially purified components were mixed and preincubated with TBB before nucleotides were added to start the transcription reaction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, upper panel, preincubation of purified factors with increasing amounts of TBB resulted in a dose-dependant decrease of Pol I transcriptional activity, indicating that inhibition of CK2-mediated phosphorylation of one or more components of the Pol I machinery drastically reduces transcription. This result is further supported by studies showing that addition of a CK2 phosphoacceptor peptide but not an unrelated peptide (flag peptide) to an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction causes a decrease in Pol I transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panel). This CK2 phosphoacceptor peptide contains the consensus CK2 phosphorylatable sequence and has been shown to act as a competitive substrate and inhibit CK2-dependent transcription by Pol II and Pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CK2 activity influences the interaction between SL1 and UBF in cultured cells</title><p>To investigate the molecular mechanism by which CK2 regulates Pol I transcription, we determined whether CK2 activity affects the network of protein&#x02013;protein interactions involved in the assembly of the Pol I PIC. For this analysis, we focused on the interactions between UBF and SL1 and between Pol I and Rrn3, since these interactions are known to be modulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Moreover, UBF and Rrn3 appear to be cellular targets of CK2 since phosphopeptide mapping of <italic>in vivo</italic>-labeled UBF and Rrn3 revealed that peptides bearing CK2 phosphorylatable sites on both proteins are indeed phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). 293T cells were transfected with vectors expressing flag-UBF (pCMV-flag-UBF) or flag-Rrn3 (pCMV-flag-Rrn3) and treated with either the CK2 kinase inhibitor TBB or DMSO (vehicle). After 2 h of continuous treatment, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-flag agarose resin. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated products shows that a smaller amount of SL1 is coimmunoprecipitated with UBF in the extract from cell treated with TBB compared to the extract from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the interaction between UBF and SL1 is reduced in the cells treated with TBB. By contrast, the interaction of Rrn3 with the polymerase is not affected by the treatment with the CK2 kinase inhibitor, as similar amounts of Pol I &#x003b2;&#x02032; subunit were coimmunoprecipitated with Rrn3 from TBB- and DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). SL1 and Pol I did not co-immunoprecipitate with an unrelated flag-tagged protein (flag-lamin A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), confirming that the observed protein interactions were not due to non-specific binding to the anti-flag resin. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the kinase activity of CK2 specifically influences the interaction between UBF and SL1.</p></sec><sec><title>SL1 makes direct contact with a 40 amino acid domain in the C-terminus of UBF but the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the UBF&#x02013;SL1 interaction requires an extended region comprising HMG boxes 5 and 6 and the C-terminus</title><p>We have previously shown that the C-terminal region of UBF is required for SL1 binding and further demonstrated that phosphorylation of UBF is necessary for establishing a stable UBF&#x02013;SL1 complex at the rRNA gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). However, the phosphoamino acid residues and the cellular kinase involved in the phosphorylation-dependent binding of SL1 have not been identified. Notably, the C-terminal region of UBF from amino acids 670 to 764 contains a series of serine residues that are embedded within CK2 consensus sites (<bold>S/T</bold>XXE/D). Moreover, this region is highly phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and mutation of nine conserved serine sites within this region of mouse UBF abolishes CK2 phosphorylation within the acidic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). To investigate the potential role that phosphorylation within this region plays in the regulation of SL1 binding, we first mapped the minimal SL1 binding region of UBF and then examined its dependence on phosphorylation. For this purpose, a series of UBF mutants containing progressive truncations of the C-terminal region were expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells and incubated with partially purified SL1. After extensive washes, the presence of bound SL1 was determined by western blot analysis with TBP and TAF<sub>I</sub>110 antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, deletion of the last 18 amino acids of UBF (UBF746C) does not affect the binding to SL1 (lane 4), while further deletion of an additional 18 amino acid residues (UBF728C) results in a significant loss of binding (lane 3). Further deletions of the C-terminus (UBF706C and UBF670C) completely eliminate SL1 binding (lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the region of UBF between amino acids 706 and 746 is required for this protein interaction. To determine whether this 40 amino acid region can bind to SL1 by itself, we then carried out protein interaction assays using GST-fusion UBF mutants spanning the C-terminal region of UBF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The results of this experiment show that GST-UBF(706&#x02013;746) (lane 2) binds to SL1 as well as GST-UBF(670&#x02013;746) (lane 3) and GST-UBF746C (lane 1), confirming that the region from amino acids 706 to 746 within the C-terminal domain of UBF makes direct contact with SL1.</p><p>The treatment of recombinant full length UBF purified from insect cells with AP causes a significant reduction in SL1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) (see also Figure 6C, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that phosphorylation of UBF regulates the interaction between UBF and SL1. To determine whether the region of UBF between amino acids 706 and 746 is also necessary and sufficient for the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of this interaction, a series of UBF mutants were expressed and purified from insect cells and treated with AP or buffer before incubation with SL1. After extensive washes, the bound proteins were resolved on an SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel and the presence of SL1 was detected by western blot with TBP antibody. The results of this experiment, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, indicate that the binding of SL1 to UBF (706&#x02013;746) was not significantly affected by treatment with AP (lanes 9 and 10), suggesting that this domain of UBF binds to SL1 independently of its phosphorylation state. This result was confirmed in a protein interaction assay with bacterially expressed UBF (706&#x02013;746) (data not shown). A similar result was also obtained with a slightly longer UBF mutant [UBF (670&#x02013;746), lanes 7 and 8]. In contrast, the phosphorylation-dependency of the interaction was restored in the reaction containing UBF (491&#x02013;746), a UBF mutant that contains HMG boxes five and six in addition to the C-terminal domain of UBF, since the AP-treated protein shows a dramatic reduction in SL1 binding compared to the mock-treated counterpart (lanes 5 and 6). These results suggest that although SL1 binds to the region of UBF between amino acids 706 and 746, the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of this molecular interaction requires the presence of an additional region from amino acids 491 to 670 (HMG boxes five and six). This interpretation is strongly supported by the result showing that UBFdx, a UBF mutant missing HMG boxes five and six, binds to SL1 equally well with and without treatment with AP (lanes 3 and 4).</p></sec><sec><title>Phospho-ablation/mimicking mutants of UBF indicate that phosphorylation of the C-terminus of UBF by CK2 regulates SL1 binding</title><p>One possible interpretation of the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is that phosphorylation of serine residues within the region between amino acids 491 and 670 regulates SL1 binding. However, these results do not rule out that in the context of the full length protein phosphorylation within the C-terminus or in combination with the phosphorylation in HMG boxes five and six are important for the regulation this interaction. To address this question and to attempt to identify the phosphorylation sites critical for modulating this protein&#x02013;protein interaction, we examined whether CK2-acceptor sites between amino acids 491 and 764 play any role in this regulatory process. This region of UBF contains 12 CK2 phosphorylatable serines and 9 of these sites are located within the C-terminal domain, between amino acid 670 and 764 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We therefore generated a series of phospho-ablation and phospho-mimicking mutations by replacing CK2 phosphorylatable serine residues with alanine/glycine or glutamic/aspartic acid within the region from HMG box five to the C-terminus of UBF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Constructs encoding flag-tagged wild-type UBF, UBF670C and the set of aforementioned mutants were transfected into 293T cells, and the interaction of these proteins with endogenous SL1 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-flag resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As expected, full length UBF binds well to SL1 (lane 1) whereas UBF670C, which lacks the SL1 binding domain, fails to co-immunoprecipitate SL1 (lane 2). The UBF mutant in which three serine residues on HMG box six are mutated to alanines (UBF3A) binds to SL1 as well as the wild-type protein (lane 3). On the other hand, the UBF mutant with nine serines within the C-terminus substituted with alanine/glycine residues (UBF9A/G) binds poorly to SL1 (lane 4). Mutations of these nine residues affect SL1 binding independently of mutations at other CK2-acceptor sites, since UBF with combined Ser to Ala/Gly substitutions in HMG box six and the C-terminus (UBF3A + 9A/G) displays a SL1 binding capacity similar to UBF9A/G (lane 5). In contrast to the alanine/glycine mutations, the substitution of CK2-acceptor sites in HMG box six or in the C-terminus of UBF with negatively charge residues, which mimic phosphorylated amino acids, results in a similar or slightly better binding than wild-type UBF (lanes 6 and 7, respectively). Analogous results were obtained in protein binding assays with truncated UBF mutants [UBF (479&#x02013;764) 9A/G and UBF (479&#x02013;764) 9D/E; data not shown]. These results suggest that in the presence of HMG boxes 5 and 6, phosphorylation of CK2 phosphoacceptor serine residues located within the C-terminal region between amino acids 670 and 764 regulates the interaction with SL1. In contrast, CK2 phosphoacceptor serines outside this region do not seem to influence this interaction. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that in contrast to wild-type UBF, treatment of UBF9D/E with AP does not influence SL1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>To examine the impact of UBF phosphorylation by CK2 on the recruitment of SL1 to the rRNA gene promoter, we performed ChIP assays. Since endogenous UBF is potentially a heterogeneous population with varying degrees of phosphorylation, we specifically compared and contrasted the recruitment of SL1 by the phospho-ablation and phospho-mimicking UBF mutants UBF9A/G and UBF9D/E. For this purpose, cells were transfected with flag-UBF9A/G or flag-UBF9D/E and chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against flag, TAF<sub>I</sub>110 and TBP, and a non-immune serum control. Immunoprecipitation with flag antibody show that UBF9A/G and UBF9D/E bind to the rRNA gene promoter sequences with equal affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). No detectable amount of rRNA promoter DNA immunoprecipitated with flag antibody in cells transfected with flag-lamin A (data not shown). On the other hand, the recovery of rRNA gene promoter sequences in ChIP reactions with antibodies against TAF<sub>I</sub>110 and TBP in cells expressing UBF9A/G was significantly lower than in cells expressing UBF9D/E. This result is likely an underestimate of the difference in SL1 recruitment between the two UBF variants since it assumes that the flag protein occupies all the rRNA promoter sites while is it likely that the transfected proteins are associated with only a fraction of the rRNA promoter sites.</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that phosphorylation of serines located within the carboxy terminal region of UBF play an important role in SL1 binding. However, since the C-terminal domain of UBF binds to SL1 regardless of its phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;10), our data suggest that phosphorylation of this region of UBF is not directly involved in SL1 binding but rather influences the accessibility of this region to SL1, possibly through a phosphorylation-induced conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation of the C-terminus of UBF promotes multiple rounds of transcription</title><p>To investigate the molecular mechanism by which phosphoserine residues located within the C-terminal domain of UBF affects transcription, we examined the effect of the nine aforementioned phospho-ablation and phospho-mimicking mutations on single and multiple rounds of transcription on ITs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription assays with ITs have been useful to study the assembly of the PIC on the promoter and their activities in single and multiple rounds of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Hence, a biotinylated human rRNA template was immobilized on streptavidin-based magnetic bead and incubated with purified wild-type UBF, UBF670C, UBF9A/G or UBF9D/E. After the unbound proteins were removed by extensive washes, the amounts of wild-type UBF and mutated UBF variants bound to the ITs were determined by western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, wild-type and mutant UBF proteins bind to the ITs with equal affinity. This result is in agreement with previous studies showing that DNA binding of mammalian UBF is mediated by the first four HMG boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The ITs bound to wild-type UBF and UBF mutants were then incubated with nuclear extract prepared from HeLa cells to allow the assembly of the PIC. The unbound proteins were then removed by extensive washes and each PIC-assembled template was split equally into eight aliquots and used in single and multiple rounds of transcription assays. Calf thymus DNA (ctDNA), which prevents RNA polymerase and other factors from reassembling on the DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), was added to the appropriate set of reactions to limit transcription to a single round. Nucleotides were then added to the PICs-assembled templates to start transcription and the amount of transcripts generated in each reaction was determined at various time points by nuclease S1 protection assays. In the single round of transcription assays the level of transcripts generated by PICs with UBF9A/G or UBF9D/E is not significantly different from those generated by PIC with wild-type UBF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, upper panel, lanes 1, 3&#x02013;5, 7&#x02013;9, 11&#x02013;13, 15 and 16). By contrast, the PIC with UBF670C shows an overall reduction in transcriptional activity at every time point examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, upper, lanes 2, 6, 10 and 14). This result is in agreement with earlier data showing that the C-terminal region of UBF plays an important role in activation of Pol I transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Strikingly, while PICs with wild-type UBF, UBF9A/G and UBF9D/E yield similar levels of transcripts in single round reactions, the amount of transcripts generated in the multiple rounds of transcription by PIC with UBF9A/G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lower panel, lanes 7, 11 and 15) are considerably lower than those generated by PICs with wild-type UBF (lanes 1, 5, 9 and 13) or UBF9D/E (lanes 4, 8, 12 and 16). The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> shows the profile of multiple rounds of transcription reactions from three independent experiments. These results indicate that the amount of transcripts produced by the UBF9A/G-assembled PIC does not increase significantly after 5 min of reaction, while the level of transcripts generated by PICs with wild-type UBF and UBF9D/E show a steady increase over time. Interestingly, PIC with UBF9D/E, which resembles a constitutively phosphorylated UBF, is slightly more efficient than PIC with wild-type UBF in multiple rounds of transcription. These findings suggest that the phosphorylation of nine CK2-acceptor serines on the C-terminus of UBF is not essential for the initial assembly of a productive initiation complex but is important for transcription re-initiation, possibly through the stabilization of the interaction between UBF and SL1 at the rRNA gene promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here we provide experimental evidence in support for a direct role of CK2 in Pol I transcription. These results in combination with recently published data indicate that this protein kinase regulates gene transcription by all three classes of nuclear RNA polymerase (Pol I, II and III) in human cells. While a relationship between Pol I transcription and CK2 has been implied by studies showing that mammalian UBF is a substrate of CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) and CK2 cofractionates with Pol I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), the functional significance of these findings was unknown. Our studies now show that Pol I transcription activity in cultured cells is significantly reduced upon inhibition of endogenous CK2 with a specific chemical inhibitor (TBB). This drug is highly specific for CK2 and the concentrations used in our assays inhibit &#x0223c;80% of CK2 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). TBB-treated nuclear extracts also display lower Pol I transcriptional activity than mock-treated nuclear extracts and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays with partially purified proteins demonstrate that CK2 activity directly regulates Pol I transcription. The fold effect on Pol I transcription by CK2 observed in our transcription assays is comparable to that of other regulatory factors that influence the function of UBF, SL1 or Rrn3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>) and that reported on CK2-mediated regulation of Pol II and III transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p><p>Chromatographic fractionation and immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts from human cells show that CK2 is associated with RNA polymerase I but not with UBF and SL1, as observed in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Interestingly, ChIP assays indicate that CK2 is found at the promoter of the rRNA genes. However CK2, unlike Pol I, is not detected at the 18S coding or termination regions of the rRNA genes, suggesting that this protein kinase is recruited to the rRNA gene promoter by Pol I but is then released from the polymerase upon the transition to transcription elongation. In this scenario, CK2 would have access and phosphorylate transcription factors that are only found at the promoter. This would provide a fine control mechanism that allows the phosphorylation of the subpopulation of UBF found at the promoter and involved in SL1 binding, but prevents that of UBF molecules that are bound to other regions of the rRNA gene. Since CK2 does not bind to UBF or SL1, it is likely released from the rRNA gene promoter upon the transition to transcription elongation. However, we cannot rule out that CK2 remains at the promoter through interactions with UBF or SL1 that may have been disrupted by the experimental conditions used in the extract fractionation studies.</p><p>Biochemical analyses have indicated that binding of UBF to the rRNA gene promoter is critical for the recruitment of SL1 and the assembly of a productive preintiation complex at the rDNA promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). These <italic>in vitro</italic> data are supported by cell-based studies, which showed that association of UBF with the rRNA gene clusters is sufficient to recruit the Pol I transcriptional machinery to these loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). A recent report has challenged this model and suggested that SL1 stably binds to the rRNA gene promoter in the absence of UBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). We have never observed a detectable binding of human SL1 to DNA by either DNA footprinting or EMSA and our data support a key role for UBF in nucleating the pre-initiation complex at the rRNA gene promoter.</p><p>We have previously reported that phosphorylation of UBF regulates the interaction between this factor and SL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The C-terminal region of UBF is highly phosphorylated in active growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), and its phosphorylation state is modulated by signaling pathways activated by growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). The C-terminal region of UBF is exceptionally rich in serine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). This unusual amino acid composition has made the identification of the phosphorylated amino acid residues by conventional approaches particularly difficult, and attempts to map the phosphorylated sites within this region by mass spectrometry have been unsuccessful. Yet, inspection of UBF amino acid sequence indicates that the C-terminal region contains several CK2 phosphoacceptor sites and phosphorylation within this region by CK2 has been reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). However, the function of UBF that is regulated by CK2 phosphorylation was not determined. Here we show that inhibition of CK2 activity in cultured cells specifically affects the interaction between UBF and SL1, suggesting a direct involvement of this protein kinase in a regulatory process that influence transcription initiation. In agreement with this finding, we demonstrated through the analysis of a set of phospho-mimicking/ablation mutants that nine CK2 phosphorylation sites on the carboxy-terminus of UBF are important for binding to SL1. The relevance of CK2-mediated phosphorylation within the C-terminal domain of UBF in the transcription process is underscored by the transcription assays with ITs, which show that the phospho-ablation mutant UBF9A/G are much less efficient than wild-type UBF or phospho-mimicking mutant UBF9D/E in promoting multiple rounds of transcription.</p><p>We have previously reported that a kinase activity associated with large T antigen phosphorylates UBF and regulate the interaction of UBF with SL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Although we have experimental evidence indicating that CK2 associates with large T antigen, we have recently identified additional cellular kinases that bind to large T antigen (S. Navarro and L. Comai, unpublished data) and studies are in progress to determine the relative contribution of these kinases to UBF phosphorylation and SL1 binding.</p><p>CK2 is a constitutively active protein kinase. This raises the question of how it plays its regulatory role in Pol I transcription. Since CK2 has been detected in the nucleolus of active growing but not confluent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>), it is likely that the subcellular localization of CK2 is regulated by growth signals. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that CK2 can be transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and nucleolus by direct interaction with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>), suggesting that the recruitment of CK2 to the rRNA gene promoter can be mediated by interaction with factors other than Pol I. Significantly, a recent study has indicated that FGF-2 can stimulate Pol I transcription by binding to UBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>).</p><p>UBF belongs to a subfamily of the HMG proteins (HMG1 proteins) that have one or more HMG1 box domains similar to the High Mobility Group proteins 1 and 2. This family of proteins is also characterized by the presence of an acidic region at the C-terminus which commonly contains canonical CK2 phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). Studies on HMG1 proteins have revealed that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the acidic C-terminal domain induces a conformational change in the HMG box domain, which affect its DNA binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). UBF contains six HMG1-like boxes and the first four (HMG boxes 1&#x02013;4) are involved in DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). However HMG boxes 5 and 6 are not required for DNA binding and their function was never well understood. The data presented in this study suggest that the region between HMG boxes 5 and 6 is required for conferring the phosphorylation-dependency of the UBF&#x02013;SL1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since this region does not bind directly to SL1, we propose that phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of UBF induces a structural change in these HMG boxes which makes the C-terminal region of UBF, from amino acids 706 to 746, available for SL1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In contrast, HMG boxes 1&#x02013;4 do not appear to be structurally affected by CK2 phosphorylation of the C-terminus since the phospho-mimicking/ablation mutants of UBF bind to the ITs equally well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Clearly, the phosphorylation-induced conformational change hypothesis can only be rigorously tested through detailed structural studies.</p><p>The critical role that CK2 plays in general transcription has been recently emphasized by studies showing that this protein kinase is present on the promoter of RNA Pol II- and III-transcribed genes. Analyses carried out in the Hernandez lab indicated that CK2 associates with the U6 promoter and by phosphorylating components of the transcription complex, it plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in transcription by RNA polymerase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Likewise, experiments done in Reinberg lab have shown that CK2 is associated with the downstream promoter element (DPE) of a number of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes and exerts a positive effect on the transcription of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Our study, which provides evidence that CK2 also plays a critical role in RNA polymerase I transcription, reinforces the concept that this protein kinase is an important component of all nuclear transcriptional machineries. In regard to Pol I transcription, the experiments described in this study suggest a model by which CK2 is recruited to the promoter via the RNA polymerase I/Rrn3 complex and stimulates multiple rounds of Pol I transcription by stabilizing the UBF&#x02013;SL1 complex at the rRNA gene promoter through phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of UBF. In contrast, lack of phosphorylation at the reported sites would lead to the formation of an unstable complex that rapidly disassembles from the rRNA gene promoter. While this work underscores the functional link between CK2 and UBF, we cannot rule out that phosphorylation of other components of the PIC by CK2 may also influence Pol I transcription and future studies will examine this possibility.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank members of the Comai and Reddy labs for helpful discussions and comments on the paper.

(<bold>A</bold>) The protein kinase CK2 cofractionates and co-immunoprecipitates with the RNA polymerase I/Rrn3 complex. Nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa S3 cells were fractionated by column chromatography and the peak fractions containing UBF (lane 1), SL1 (lane 3), Pol I/Rrn3 (lane 4) were resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and analyzed for the presence of the indicated proteins by western blot (lanes 1&#x02013;4). Lane 2 contains recombinant UBF purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. The peak Pol I/Rrn3 fraction (lane 4) was subjected to immunoprecipitation using goat polyclonal antibodies against CK2&#x003b1; (lane 5) or TAF<sub>II</sub>32 (lane 6), and the resulting products were analyzed by western blot with antibody against the indicated factors. (<bold>B</bold>) Nucleolar extracts were prepared from four liters of HeLa S3 cells and loaded on a Poros HQ column. The column was then subjected to a continuous salt gradient and aliquots of indicated fractions were tested for the presence of Pol I, SL1, CK2 and UBF by western blot analysis as described in the Materials and Methods. (<bold>C</bold>) CK2 associates with the rRNA gene promoter but not with the coding and termination regions. Cross-linked chromatin isolated from HeLa cells was immunnoprecipitated with rabbit non-immune serum (control), rabbit antisera against UBF and Pol I &#x003b2;&#x02032; subunit (194 kDa), and goat polyclonal antibodies against TAF<sub>II</sub>32 and CK2. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was quantified by real-time PCR using primers specific to the core promoter, 18S coding, and termination regions of the rRNA genes. The relative associations of indicated proteins with the three regions of the rRNA genes are shown as the fold increases over non-immune serum (control).

TBB was added to cells in culture at the final concentration of 80 &#x003bc;M. 45S pre-rRNA level was analyzed by nuclease S1 protection assay using 5&#x02032; end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the region from &#x02212;20 to +40 of the rRNA gene (upper panel) or by RT&#x02013;PCR (lower panel). Either 5 &#x003bc;g (lanes 1&#x02013;5) or 2.5 &#x003bc;g (lanes 6 and 7) of total RNA were used in the nuclease S1 protection assay. Products were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) to detect &#x003b2;-actin transcripts were used as an internal standard to normalize the amounts of RNA used in the nuclease S1 protection assays.

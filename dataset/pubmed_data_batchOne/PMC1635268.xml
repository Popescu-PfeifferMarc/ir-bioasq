Among the types of signals identified are intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis such as Mg-protoporphyrin IX (MgProto). In <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, it was suggested that this tetrapyrrole mediates the light induction of chaperone gene <italic>HSP70A</italic>. Here we have analyzed <italic>cis</italic> elements involved in the regulation of <italic>HSP70A</italic> by MgProto and light. We identified two promoters and between their transcription start sites two regulatory regions that each may confer inducibility by MgProto and light to both <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoters. These regulatory regions, when cloned in front of basal non-light inducible heterologous promoters, conferred inducibility by MgProto and light. The orientation and distance independent function of these <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences qualifies them as enhancers that mediate the response of nuclear genes to a chloroplast signal. Mutational analysis of one of these regulatory regions and an alignment with promoters of other MgProto-inducible genes revealed the sequence motif (G/C)CGA(C/T)N(A/G)N<sub>15</sub> (T/C/A)(A/T/G) which, as shown for <italic>HSP70A</italic>, may confer MgProto responsiveness. This <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence element is employed for induction of <italic>HSP70A</italic> by both MgProto and light, lending support to the model that light induction of this gene is mediated via MgProto.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The existence of three DNA-containing organelles in eukaryotic algae and higher plants requires a coordination of gene expression in these compartments. The nucleus is the major contributor of gene products that find their way into chloroplasts and mitochondria. It also exerts a tight control over gene expression in these organelles [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)]. On the other hand, intact, functional organelles are a prerequisite for the expression of a subset of genes in the nucleus [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>)]. These observations support the concept of a bi-directional exchange between the DNA-containing organelles.</p><p>For the retrograde communication of plastids with the nucleus, experimental data until now have provided evidence for five different signaling pathways that may coordinate the expression of nuclear genes with the requirements of chloroplasts. One of these pathways is dependent on product(s) of plastid protein synthesis since mutants lacking plastid ribosomes or the application of plastid translation inhibitors caused a decrease in the expression of a set of nuclear genes [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and references therein). For another retrograde pathway the signal is chloroplast-generated singlet oxygen, shown in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to result in the specific upregulation of 70 nuclear genes and the downregulation of 9 nuclear genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Mutation in gene <italic>EXECUTER1</italic> abrogated the response to singlet oxygen, suggesting that the gene product either perceives the signal or is involved in its transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). A third pathway employs chloroplast-generated hydrogen peroxide which was shown to specifically activate the nuclear gene for ascorbate peroxidase (<italic>APX2</italic>) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). A fourth pathway by which chloroplasts exert control on the expression of nuclear genes is triggered by the redox state of photosynthetic electron transport components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). This redox signaling has been proposed to play a role in the adaptation of nuclear gene expression to changes in light intensity providing a feedback response loop in which the expression of photosynthesis genes is coupled to the function of the photosynthetic process [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>)]. For all of these chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling pathways, the downstream components, short of <italic>Executer1</italic> are not yet known, nor is it known if the signals converge at a single element in the promoters of responsive genes.</p><p>A fifth pathway for chloroplast-nucleus communication involves tetrapyrrole biosynthesis intermediates. In plants, plastids harbor the entire tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway to heme and to chlorophylls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Indirect evidence for a role of tetrapyrroles in the light regulation of a nuclear <italic>LHCB</italic> gene was derived from mutant and inhibitor studies using synchronized cultures of the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In higher plants an accumulation of Mg-porphyrins, caused by treatment with inhibitors of chlorophyll or carotenoid biosynthesis, was correlated with lower levels of <italic>LHCB</italic> and <italic>RBCS</italic> transcripts, suggesting a role of these tetrapyrroles in the control of nuclear transcriptional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>We found that the chlorophyll precursors Mg-protoporphyrin IX (MgProto) or Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester (MgProtoMe) may induce nuclear heat-shock genes <italic>HSP70A</italic> and <italic>HSP70B</italic> of <italic>C.reinhardtii</italic>, mimicking the normal light induction for these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). These chaperone genes are also induced in higher plants by a shift from dark to light, but an involvement of chlorophyll precursors has not yet been tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). A mutant defective in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> insertion into protophorphyrin IX (Proto) and thus devoid of Mg-porphyrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) showed no light induction of <italic>HSP70A</italic> and <italic>HSP70B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Thus, MgProto and MgProtoMe are candidates for a plastid signal in this response pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>A role for Mg-porphyrins as plastid signals is supported by the characterization of <italic>Arabidopsis gun</italic> (genome uncoupled) mutants in which expression of an <italic>LHCB</italic> gene is uncoupled from plastidal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). In these mutants, <italic>LHCB</italic> gene expression is not diminished when chloroplasts are rendered otherwise non-functional by norflurazon inhibition of carotenoid biosynthesis. Thus, the expression of a subset of nuclear genes became uncoupled from the physiological state of the plastid. The identified genes of four out of five of these <italic>gun</italic> mutants encode proteins involved in tetrapyrrole synthesis. The <italic>gun2</italic> and <italic>gun3</italic> mutations affect the heme branch of the pathway, and are presumed to affect flux through the chlorophyll branch as a result of feedback regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The GUN4 protein has been postulated to modulate nuclear gene expression by regulating MgProto synthesis or trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). The <italic>gun5</italic> mutation affects the gene encoding the H-subunit of Mg-chelatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). The enhanced accumulation of MgProto upon norflurazon treatment observed in wild type but not in the <italic>gun5</italic> mutant, in addition to MgProto feeding experiments to leaf protoplasts, provided evidence for a role of this plastid compound in the downregulation of the <italic>LHCB</italic> gene studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>Studies with tobacco plants that harbor transgenes in antisense or sense orientation for Mg-chelatase subunits <italic>CHL H</italic> and <italic>CHL I</italic> as well as for MgProto monomethyl transferase <italic>CHL M</italic> indicate a more complex role of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and intermediates in signaling at least in higher plants. In all transformants, reduced levels of Proto correlated with lower transcript levels of nuclear genes <italic>HEMA</italic>, <italic>GSA</italic> and <italic>ALAD</italic>, encoding glutamyl-tRNA reductase, glutamate-1-semi-aldehyde aminotransferase and 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, a limited number of genes that are regulated by MgProto have so far been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). These comprise genes <italic>HSP70A</italic> and <italic>HSP70E</italic>, both encoding cytosolic chaperones, <italic>HSP70B</italic> encoding a plastidal chaperone and <italic>HEMA</italic>, encoding glutamyl tRNA reductase, the first enzyme specific for porphyrin biosynthesis. These four genes are induced by the feeding of MgProto in dark; they also are induced by light.</p><p>For <italic>HSP70A</italic> evidence has accumulated that MgProto controls expression of this gene in response to irradiation; this signaling pathway being different from the pathway that controls the stress response. Upon shift from dark to light both Mg-porphyrin levels and <italic>HSP70A</italic> mRNA increase transiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The light-induced accumulation of Mg-porphyrins was shown to be essential for induction since inhibitors of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, which abolished MgProto accumulation, were shown to prevent the induction by light but not that by heat shock. Also, gametic cells shown to lack a light-induced accumulation of MgProto did not respond to light but responded to heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). In both cases, the addition of MgProto to cell cultures in the dark resulted in induction of <italic>HSP70A</italic>, indicating that this Mg-porphyrin could substitute for the light signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>Here we report on the identification of two <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoters and on two sequence elements between these promoters that appear to act as enhancers in response to the plastid signal MgProto.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Algal strains and culture conditions</title><p><italic>C.reinhardtii</italic> strain 325 (<italic>cw15</italic>, <italic>arg7-8</italic>, <italic>mt</italic>+) used throughout, was kindly provided by R.

A 1.5 kb NcoI/XhoI fragment of genomic DNA harboring the <italic>CYC6</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), after blunt-ending, was inserted into the SmaI site of pBluescript SKII+ (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

Here we set out to define the promoter elements involved in MgProto- and light-mediated induction of <italic>HSP70A</italic>. To identify such elements in their own sequence context, we converted <italic>HSP70A</italic> into a reporter gene by the insertion of a 199 bp DNA fragment from <italic>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</italic> into its 3&#x02032;-UTR (TAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). This and all subsequent constructs were inserted into a vector (pCB740) that harbors the <italic>ARG7</italic> gene of <italic>C.reinhardtii</italic> for the selection of transformants in <italic>arg7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Transformants were grown in the dark and exposed to light or MgProto or were heat-shocked in the light. Total RNA from these transformants was analyzed by RNA gel blot. About 50% of Arg<sup>+</sup> transformants with constructs that harbored 285 bp of sequence upstream from the <italic>HSP70A</italic> translation start site&#x02014;including three putative heat-shock elements (<italic>HSE</italic>)&#x02014;were inducible by MgProto, light and heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The degree of induction observed upon MgProto feeding or dark-to-light shift was similar. A deletion construct that lacked the three <italic>HSEs</italic> (&#x00394;-149) was no longer inducible by heat shock but induction by MgProto and light was preserved. Surprisingly, even deletion of sequences upstream from and including the previously defined transcription start site at position &#x02212;89 (<italic>TS<sub>A1</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>) exhibited MgProto and light inducibility (&#x00394;-81), suggesting that an additional promoter was located further downstream. In transformants with this deletion construct the degree of mRNA accumulation upon MgProto/light treatment was similar to that observed with the longer constructs. Since in transformants containing a construct that harbored only 20 bp upstream from the translation start site (&#x00394;-20) TAG-specific mRNA was not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) the additional promoter is assumed to be located between positions &#x02212;81 and &#x02212;20.</p><p>Consistent with the deletion data, primer extension experiments revealed two <italic>HSP70A</italic> transcription start sites. As judged from the increase in signal intensity observed with RNA from heat-shocked cells the upstream start site at position &#x02212;89 (<italic>TS<sub>A1</sub></italic>) is used upon heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). A second transcription start site (<italic>TS<sub>A2</sub></italic>) could be defined at position &#x02212;23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Upon dark-to-light shift signals of increased intensity were detected not only at <italic>TS<sub>A2</sub></italic> but also at <italic>TS<sub>A1</sub></italic>. This was also observed after MgProto treatment in the dark. A second promoter of <italic>HSP70A</italic> thus appears to be located downstream from <italic>TS<sub>A1</sub></italic>. This promoter was named <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic>; the one further upstream <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic>. Comparison of sequences directly upstream from the two transcription start sites did not reveal any obvious homology other than a TATA motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This, however, in the case of <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> is located only 12 bp upstream from the transcription start site.</p><p>In order to confirm and to extend these data we generated constructs that harbored <italic>HSP70A</italic> upstream sequences of various lengths in front of a different reporter gene; here we used the promoter-less <italic>HSP70B</italic> gene. This gene, which contained a residual 5&#x02032;-UTR of 18 bp, has been converted into a reporter gene by insertion of the TAG sequence described above into its 3&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Transformants harboring the longest <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoter construct (from &#x02212;23 to &#x02212;285 relative to the translation start site) exhibited induction of the reporter gene by MgProto, light and heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Transformants that only contained the reporter gene showed at most weak expression but no induction by light or MgProto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Deletion of sequences &#x02212;23 to &#x02212;80, resulting in a loss of <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> and upstream sequences, abolished the inducibility by both MgProto and light. In these transformants, heat-shock induction was preserved, indicating that promoter <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> was not affected. Presence of <italic>HSP70A</italic> sequences downstream from the heat shock-inducible promoter and including promoter <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> (sequence between &#x02212;23 and &#x02212;81) conferred inducibility by MgProto and light on the reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results indicate that promoter <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> also functions outside the context of the <italic>HSP70A</italic> gene. Transformants with a construct lacking sequences from &#x02212;23 to &#x02212;55 including <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic>, but harboring sequences from &#x02212;55 to &#x02212;81, showed no expression of the reporter gene in response to either MgProto or light. However, the presence of this same sequence (from &#x02212;55 to &#x02212;81) downstream from promoter <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> conferred inducibility by MgProto and light to transformants with this construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, third construct from top). These data imply that (i) <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoter <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> also may be activated by MgProto and light and (ii) sequence elements between positions &#x02212;55 to &#x02212;81 may confer this inducibility. Thus, <italic>HSP70A</italic> has two promoters: <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> is used for heat-shock activated transcription mediated by upstream <italic>HSEs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>); for an activation by MgProto and light, both promoters, <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic>, may be employed.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequences located between transcription start sites <italic>TS<sub>A1</sub></italic> and <italic>TS<sub>A2</sub></italic> may mediate activation of heterologous promoters by MgProto and light</title><p>Fusion of the <italic>RBCS2</italic> minimal promoter (comprising sequences from +15 to &#x02212;183 relative to the transcription start site) (<italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic>) in front of reporter gene <italic>HSP70B</italic>-<italic>TAG</italic> (resulting in a <italic>P<sub>R</sub>&#x02013;HSP70B-TAG</italic> construct) only very rarely resulted in transformants that expressed the reporter gene at elevated levels (&#x0003c;1 per 700 transformants assayed) [C.

In these rare cases we assume that the reporter gene became fused to an active gene within the <italic>C.reinhardtii</italic> genome. Insertion of the <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoter region from &#x02212;23 to &#x02212;285 into this construct upstream from <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> resulted in the frequent appearance of transformants that expressed the reporter gene in response to heat shock, MgProto and a dark-to-light shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The degree of induction by light and MgProto was similar to that seen with the <italic>HSP70A</italic> reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We observed that most but not all of the heat-shock-inducible clones also could be activated by light. Most but not all of those responded to MgProto.</p><p>Primer extension experiments were performed to elucidate the transcription start site(s) used after induction by light and heat shock. The experiments revealed that after light induction, transcription started at a site <italic>TS<sub>R</sub></italic> defined previously as the start site of the <italic>RBCS2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). The absence of transcripts from <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> or <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> after MgProto or light induction was confirmed by RNA blot experiments in which <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> upstream sequences were used as a probe (data not shown). Confirming and extending previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), we showed that transcripts generated in response to heat shock used promoter <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic>. In these experiments, we also observed two transcription start sites for <italic>HSP70B</italic> (<italic>TS<sub>B1</sub></italic> and <italic>TS<sub>B2</sub></italic>): <italic>TS<sub>B1</sub></italic> being one bp upstream from the site defined previously by the 5&#x02032; ends of cDNA clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). As deduced from the increase in signal intensity, this start site appears to be employed preferentially after the application of heat shock while <italic>TS<sub>B2</sub></italic> may be used for constitutive expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p>From these results we conclude that <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoter regulatory sequences which confer inducibility by MgProto and light do not activate their native promoters when the heterologous <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter is located downstream.

Transformants that harbored this construct exhibited no induction by MgProto and light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). As expected from the intactness of the <italic>HSEs</italic> and promoter <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic>, these transformants were inducible by heat shock. Presence of the sequence between the start sites of <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoters <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> (&#x02212;23 to &#x02212;81) in front of <italic>P<sub>R</sub>-HSP70B-TAG</italic> conferred inducibility by MgProto and light to transformants with this construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p>Since the promoter context has been shown to affect the results from an analysis of light-responsive elements in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), we tested whether a different <italic>C.reinhardtii</italic> promoter may also gain inducibility by MgProto and light when <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoter sequence elements are present. The promoter of the cytochrome c6 gene (<italic>CYC6</italic>) under normal growth conditions is essentially silent; but it has been shown to be strongly induced by copper deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). In order to ensure the specificity of signals detected in transformants, the <italic>CYC6</italic> gene was converted into a reporter gene by insertion of the TAG sequence into its 3&#x02032;-UTR. This gene contained the <italic>CYC6</italic> promoter (<italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic>) up to position &#x02212;259 from its transcription start site and thus all elements needed for induction by Cu<sup>2+</sup> deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). The <italic>CYC6</italic> gene alone in a transgene setting was not inducible by light or MgProto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Presence of <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoter sequences from &#x02212;23 to &#x02212;285 in front of <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic> conferred inducibility by MgProto, light and heat shock to transformants harboring this construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Upon heat shock, the <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> promoter apparently is used as judged from the bigger size of the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The enhanced expression seen after MgProto feeding or dark-to-light shift lead to a smaller transcript that appears to originate from <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic>. Cloning of <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoter sequences from &#x02212;23 to &#x02212;81 in front of <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic> made this promoter responsive to MgProto and light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Also, sequences from &#x02212;55 to &#x02212;81 alone could confer inducibility by MgProto and light to <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic>. The activation of <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic> and not of <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> or <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> by MgProto and light in these transformants was confirmed by the absence of hybridization signals in RNA blots when <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> sequences were used as a probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The absence of <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic>-specific mRNA showed that in this setting, similar to the one observed with <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), neither <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> nor <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> were activated by treatment with MgProto or light. Rather, promoter <italic>P<sub>c</sub></italic> appears to get activated. We draw the conclusion that <italic>HSP70A</italic> regulatory regions between transcription start sites <italic>TS<sub>A1</sub></italic> and <italic>TS<sub>A2</sub></italic> may confer MgProto and light inducibility to the heterologous promoters <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition of two regulatory regions with enhancer activity</title><p>Inspection of the <italic>HSP70A</italic> sequence between positions &#x02212;23 and &#x02212;81 revealed two 24 bp sequences that share 16 common nucleotides (shaded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). These sequences are located upstream from the <italic>HSP70A</italic> translation start site at positions &#x02212;31 to &#x02212;54 and &#x02212;56 to &#x02212;79 i.e. between the two transcription start sites <italic>TS<sub>A1</sub></italic> and <italic>TS<sub>A2</sub></italic> defined previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We tested both sequences individually for their potential enhancer function in front of the <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic>-reporter construct. Transformants that harbored constructs with nt &#x02212;31 to &#x02212;54 in front of <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> activated the reporter gene in response to MgProto and dark-to-light shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). The same was observed with constructs that harbored the more upstream sequence from &#x02212;56 to &#x02212;79. These results indicate that two regulatory regions (named I and II referring to the upstream and downstream regions, respectively) between the <italic>HSP70A</italic> transcription start sites may activate transcription when positioned upstream of the heterologous <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Both regions thus may harbor sequence motifs that possibly qualify as enhancers. We also tested transformants with these constructs for an effect of heat shock; the absence of a response indicates that sequence elements that mediate induction by heat shock are not present within the sequences tested.</p><p>Two hallmarks used for the definition of enhancers are their functionality irrespective of orientation and, within limits, their independence from the distance of the promoter they may activate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). To test the effect of orientation, we generated constructs that harbored regulatory region I in inverse orientation in front of the <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> reporter gene. Transformants harboring this construct exhibited induction of the reporter gene in response to light and MgProto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).</p><p>To test the effect of distance from the activated promoter transformants harboring constructs with spacer sequences between regulatory regions I and II and the <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter were generated. Spacer sequences of 100 or 200 bp [derived from the coding region of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> gene <italic>CGE1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>)] by themselves in front of promoter <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> only very rarely resulted in transformants that showed enhanced expression of the reporter gene in response to a dark-to-light shift. The insertion of either regulatory region I or II into these constructs upstream from the spacer sequences conferred inducibility by light and MgProto to the reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). In the active clones we confirmed that transcription started at <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> by RNA blot analyses in which the spacer was used as a probe (data not shown). Since the spacer elements apparently lack enhancer as well as promoter activity, we conclude that regulatory regions I and II, also over an increased distance, may activate promoter <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> in response to light and MgProto. Both regions thus appear to harbor sequence motifs that qualify as enhancers.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of a sequence motif that causes enhancement of transcription in response to MgProto and light</title><p>To gain information on the sequence motifs that in regulatory regions I and II are responsible for the enhancing effect, we introduced mutations into region I located upstream from the <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter fused to the <italic>HSP70B</italic> reporter gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Before transformation, all of these constructs were linearized at the upstream side of a spacer placed upstream from region I. For spacers we employed either a 100 bp sequence derived from the coding region of <italic>CGE1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) or a 82 bp sequence from the multiple cloning site of vector pFASTBAC1 (Materials and Methods). Total RNA of 30&#x02013;60 transformants that were grown in the dark and exposed to light or MgProto was analyzed by RNA dot blot. Transformants expressing the reporter gene (only 50&#x02013;60% of the Arg<sup>+</sup> transformants habored an intact reporter gene) were evaluated quantitatively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Constructs that lacked region I yielded transformants that did not respond to MgProto or light. The analysis of transformants with deletions that entered region I from the upstream side showed that absence of the GCGAC motif (mutation 1) essentially abolished activation of <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Deletions from the downstream side that removed a TATACATA motif present in both regulatory regions (mutations 3 and 4) drastically reduced inducibility by both MgProto and light. When the 11 nt located between the GCGAC and TATACATA motifs were removed, again MgProto and light activation of <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> was abolished (mutation 5). However, a smaller deletion of 5 bp from the center of region I (mutation 6) resulted in constructs that retained inducibility of <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> by MgProto and light. These results pointed to a functionally important role of nucleotides located in the upstream as well as downstream parts but not within the central segment of region I.</p><p>We next analyzed point mutations introduced into the two flanking sequences that are shared by regulatory regions I and II. A transversion mutation converted GCGAC into GATAC (mutation 7) which, when cloned in front of <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic>, resulted in transformants that showed a distinctly reduced activation by light and MgProto. The same mutation 7 in front of <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic> yielded transformants that did not respond to MgProto or light (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). It appears that, depending on the target promoter employed, the stringency of sequence requirements for promoter activation may differ. A transversional mutation within the TATACATA sequence shared by regions I and II to TAGCAATA did not significantly affect the MgProto and light activation of <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic>; a result substantiated with 60 transformants that harbored this mutation in front of <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>When the actual sequences of the various point mutations and deletions of region I located in front of the heterologous promoters <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic> were compared, it became evident that 8 nt (shadowed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) were present in all constructs that resulted in an activation by MgProto and light &#x02265;75 % of the wild-type control. The arrangement of these nucleotides reveals a striking feature since 15 nt which did not appear to play an essential role separate a TA motif at the downstream side from the upstream motif. The importance of this TA motif (or T or A individually) for the activation of <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> by both MgProto and light is supported by the lack of induction in three constructs without TA represented by mutations 3, 4 and 5, generated by deletion of either downstream or central sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Inspection of the data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) revealed that all mutations that affected the light activation also affected the activation by MgProto. Although the role of individual nucleotides in promoter activation among the 8 nt conserved in all active regions I remains to be elucidated a consensus motif GCGACNAN<sub>15</sub>TA for the plastid response element may be deduced.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The search for sequence motifs that serve as response elements for MgProto in the upstream region of the <italic>HSP70A</italic> gene revealed the existence of two promoters: the upstream one (<italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic>) is used for the response to heat shock mediated via <italic>HSEs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The second promoter, <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic>, located downstream from <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic>, was found to be activated by MgProto and light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). MgProto and light also may activate <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> when sequences downstream from its transcription start site (<italic>TS<sub>A1</sub></italic>) are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In the region between the transcription start sites of the two promoters, two related 24 bp sequences designated as regulatory region I and II for the upstream and downstream regions, respectively, were localized. Both regulatory regions share 16 identical nucleotides (indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). When cloned in front of basal/silent heterologous <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> promoters <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> or <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic>, they were shown to confer inducibility by MgProto and light to these promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>). Since variations in the distance between the regulatory regions and the promoters as well as an opposite orientation (tested for region I) still conferred light and MgProto inducibility on a basal <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we concluded that regions I and II harbor sequence motifs that may qualify as enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). Their response to MgProto, a compound exclusively synthesized in plastids, led to their designation as plastid response elements (<italic>PREs</italic>).</p><p>A mutational dissection of regulatory region I provided information about essential nucleotides that make up the <italic>PRE</italic>. Nucleotides that in regulatory regions I and II may be important for <italic>PRE</italic> function became apparent when the actual DNA sequences of various mutated and wild type regulatory regions cloned in front of <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> or <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic> were aligned (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Such an alignment revealed a motif GCGACNAN<sub>15</sub>TA that is present in both wild type and all mutant regulatory regions which exhibited enhancer activity. We noted that the TA motif at the 3&#x02032; end may have an important role in <italic>PRE</italic> activity since in mutations 3 and 5, both harboring the upstream consensus sequence but lacking TA, the enhancer activity was abolished (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In active <italic>PREs</italic> no conserved nucleotides were detected between the A at position 7 and the T at position 15. However, this does not rule out a participation of individual nucleotides of this sequence in an interaction with factor(s) that bind to the <italic>PRE</italic>. Information on the role of this region may be gained by the assay of elements mutated at each position individually.</p><p>Supportive evidence for this <italic>PRE</italic> as plastid response element came from an inspection of promoters from MgProto-regulated genes. Besides <italic>HSP70A</italic>, five other genes (<italic>HSP70B</italic>, <italic>HSP70E</italic>, <italic>HEMA, ALAD</italic> and <italic>CGE1</italic>) have been shown to be induced by MgProto [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and N. Shao and C. F. Beck, unpublished data]. In the promoters of these five genes putative <italic>PREs</italic> were detected. Their representation of multiple alignments by position weight matrix revealed an extended <italic>PRE</italic> consensus motif (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In some genes deviations from the consensus sequence observed in regulatory regions I and II were noted: Although a CGA core is present in all elements analyzed, for G at position 4, C at position 8 and A at position 10, an alternative nucleotide is observed in some <italic>PREs</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The TA motif at the 3&#x02032; side (positions 26 and 27) appears not to be highly conserved. Although in 6 of 8 putative <italic>PREs</italic> a T is present at the first position, C and A also may occur. At the second position, an A is present in 4 out of 8 <italic>PREs</italic>; here T and G were also observed. However, we noticed that in all cases studied, either T is present at the first position or A at the second position. We considered that sequences flanking the putative <italic>PREs</italic> may contribute to their functionality. However, the heterogeneity in flanking nucleotides (at least three different ones at each position) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) suggests this to be unlikely. Although additional nucleotides may well play a role in the interaction of <italic>PRE</italic> with regulatory protein(s) a consensus sequence of <italic>PRE</italic> derived from mutant studies and an alignment with putative <italic>PREs</italic> of other MgProto-regulated genes may be predicted: (G/C)CGA(C/T)N (A/G)N<sub>15</sub> (T/C/A) (A/T/G). The relative frequency of individual nucleotides at each position may be deducted from the sequence logo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This element clearly is distinct from the G-box (<italic>CUF1</italic>) element (CACGTA) that in the promoter of the <italic>Arabidopsis LHCB1</italic> gene has been implicated in its regulation by MgProto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) (see below).</p><p>Of considerable interest is the question whether the activation of homologous and heterologous promoters by MgProto is mediated by the same components as the activation by light. With the exception of a few clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), all regulatory region I- or II-harboring transgene promoters that responded to light also could be activated by MgProto feeding in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The few transformants that exhibited induction by light but not by MgProto may be explained by chromatin structure imposed by sequences flanking the insertion [since this number was reduced when freshly transformed clones were analyzed (data not shown)]. This suggested that both regulatory regions harbor sequence motifs that are targets for MgProto- and light-activated transcription factors. Mutant analyses of regulatory region I showed that a mutational reduction in MgProto activation always was accompanied by a comparable lowering in reporter gene activation by light (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These data support a model in which the <italic>PRE</italic> mediates the induction by both light and MgProto. The definition of the <italic>PRE</italic> as common target for plastid- and light-activated signaling pathways is in agreement with the concept that plastid-derived MgProto is an intermediate in the pathway by which light activates <italic>HSP70A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Whether the <italic>PRE</italic> is activated by transcription factor(s) that directly interact(s) with MgProto as shown in yeast for transcription factor HAP1 that is activated by mitochondria-derived heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>), or indirectly via a signaling cascade, remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Surprisingly, neither of the <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoters <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> nor <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> was activated by treatment with MgProto or light when placed upstream of <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> or <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Rather, <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> or <italic>P<sub>C</sub></italic> were shown to be activated in the presence of a functional <italic>PRE</italic>. In contrast, both <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoters exhibited <italic>PRE</italic>-dependent activity when cloned upstream of promoterless reporter gene <italic>HSP70B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results support previous observations in which a start of transcription at the most downstream <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter upon light activation was noted even when three <italic>RBCS2</italic> promoters were sandwiched between the <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoter and the reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). We envision two alternatives that could account for the lack of <italic>PRE</italic>-mediated activation of <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> or <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> when a heterologous promoter is situated downstream. (i) Transcription is restricted to the promoter located proximal to the reporter gene. (ii) Transcripts initiated at the distal promoter(s) were unstable due to the presence of additional 5&#x02032; sequences. We consider this latter possibility unlikely, since transcripts originating from <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> were detected after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>). To account for the first possibility, we speculate that the formation of transcription initiating complexes promoted by <italic>PRE</italic>-bound factor(s) at all promoters but the one(s) situated most proximal to the translational start site is prevented. Here, nucleosome positioning and chromatin structure may play an important role. This idea is supported by the observation that activation of transcription by heat shock, which employs promoter P<sub>A1</sub> situated close to <italic>HSEs</italic>, correlates with a loosened chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>).</p><p><italic>Cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements have been defined previously within promoter regions of various <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> genes. Thus, the multiple presence of a 10 bp <italic>tub</italic> box in the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-tubulin promoter was shown to be essential for increased transcription following deflagellation as well as upregulation of the promoter during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). In the nitrate reductase gene (<italic>NIA1</italic>) promoter, two elements with 68% sequence identity were shown to be required for induction by nitrate and for repression by ammonium of a fused heterologous minimal &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-tubulin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). Elements that activate promoters in response to copper and oxygen deficiencies have been defined in the upstream regions of <italic>CYC6</italic> and <italic>CPX1</italic> (encoding coproporphyrinogen oxidase). Transcriptional activation occurs through copper responsive elements. These copper responsive elements, two are found within the <italic>CYC6</italic> promoter and one within the <italic>CPX1</italic> promoter, share a GTAC core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). Additional nucleotides in the flanking regions were shown to contribute to copper-responsive expression, but none are absolutely essential. Similar to the redundant function of the two <italic>PRE</italic>s of the <italic>HSP70A</italic> promoter defined here, both copper responsive elements of the <italic>CYC6</italic> promoter appear to function independently by activating transcription from a heterologous <italic>cis</italic>-associated promoter, in this case the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-tubulin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Recently, a transcription factor Crr1 that interacts with the copper responsive elements has been identified previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>CRR1</italic> gene were shown not to activate copper response element-containing genes such as <italic>CYC6</italic> and <italic>CPX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>).</p><p>In higher plants, multiple attempts have been made to define specific plastid responsive elements. Light responsive promoters of genes that are also subject to control by a plastid signal&#x02014;in most cases coding for the photosynthetic machinery&#x02014;were compared and subjected to mutational analyses. A conclusion derived from these studies suggested that light and the plastid signal control expression of nuclear genes via the same <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). In these studies, the plastid signal involved in controlling nuclear gene expression was modulated by the addition of norflurazon that, in the light, leads to photooxidation of the thylakoid membrane.</p><p>Subsequently it was shown that regulation of nuclear genes by light and a plastid factor, activated by norflurazon treatment, employs complex <italic>cis</italic> elements formed by aggregation of cognate sequences of different transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>). A modular array of two motifs&#x02014;an I-box and a G-box&#x02014;were shown recently to be sufficient for the regulation of a minimal promoter by light and a norflurazon treatment-derived plastidal signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the repression of gene <italic>LHCB1</italic> by norflurazon treatment was shown to correlate with the accumulation of MgProto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). A role of this tetrapyrrole in <italic>LHCB1</italic> regulation was strengthened by a repression of <italic>LHCB1</italic> in leaves incubated with MgProto. The target of the norflurazon/MgProto mediated repression was revealed in transgenic lines harboring fusions of wild type or mutant <italic>LHCB1</italic> promoters to a reporter gene. A mutated G-box motif within the <italic>LHCB1</italic> promoter made it refractile against inhibition by norflurazon treatment. Levels of expression were the same in wild type and the <italic>gun5</italic> mutant that, due to a defect in the H-subunit of Mg-chelatase was shown to accumulate less MgProto in presence of the herbicide. This lead to the conclusion that the G-box motif (CACGTA) may confer regulation by MgProto on the <italic>LHCB1</italic> promoter. This G-box motif or the closely related CACGTG motif were observed in 42 out of 70 genes that responded by repression to norflurazon treatment-induced MgProto accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of our results we propose a model for the MgProto-mediated light activation of <italic>HSP70A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A shift of cultures from dark to light induces a transient increase in plastidal Mg-porphyrin levels and the transport of a subfraction of MgProto or its monomethyl ester to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In the cytosol, MgProto is bound by a regulatory protein, possibly a transcription factor, and modifies its activity and/or translocation to the nucleus. As a consequence, this protein or factor(s) activated through this protein may interact with enhancer <italic>PRE</italic>, resulting in the activation of upstream promoter <italic>P<sub>A1</sub></italic> and downstream promoter <italic>P<sub>A2</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). The <italic>PRE</italic> may also activate heterologous promoters in response to MgProto or light, provided it is in the vicinity of these promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). With a sequence element at hand that is a target for a plastid-derived factor, strategies to identify the protein(s) that, upon MgProto feeding, interact with these elements, can now be devised.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ning Shao for the generation of alignments.

In this work, the satellite virus was engineered to obtain an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&#x02013;<italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> shuttle vector for gene transfer and expression in <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> by fusing site-specifically the pSSVx chromosome with an <italic>E.coli</italic> plasmid replicon and the ampicillin resistance gene. The pSSVx-based vector was proven functional like the parental virus, namely it was able to spread efficiently through infected <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> cells. Moreover, the hybrid plasmid stably transformed <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> and propagated with no rearrangement, recombination or integration into the host chromosome. The high copy number of the artificial genetic element was found comparable with that calculated for the wild-type pSSVx in the new host cells, with no need of genetic markers for vector maintenance in the cells and for transfomant enrichment.</p><p>The newly constructed vector was also shown to be an efficient cloning vehicle for the expression of passenger genes in <italic>S.solfataricus</italic>. In fact, a derivative plasmid carrying an expression cassette of the lacS gene encoding the &#x003b2;-glycosidase from <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> under the control of the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> chaperonine (thermosome tf55) heat shock promoter was also able to drive the expression of a functional enzyme. Complementation of the &#x003b2;-galactosidase deficiency in a deletion mutant strain of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> demonstrated that <italic>lacS</italic> gene was an efficient marker for selection of single transformants on solid minimal lactose medium.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Host/virus interaction modes have provided windows to study microbial diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) as well as genetic processes at the molecular level, in particular for prokaryotes, and hence have helped in clarifying the physiological mechanisms, the dependence on the specific biochemical environment and evolution of their host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>Very few viruses have been identified from Archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) as compared with Bacteria and Eukarya and detailed description has been reported for those from hyperthermophilic archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) with representatives that replicate in the genus <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> being the majority within the kingdom Crenarchaeota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). To date, the <italic>Fuselloviridae</italic> are the most widespread on earth in the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> genus with viruses sharing similar morphology as well as DNA genome size and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p><italic>Sulfolobus</italic> spindle-shaped virus 1 (SSV1) is the best studied member of this family and demonstrated to be temperate both in <italic>Sulfolobus shibatae</italic> and in non-natural but related <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> hosts, such as <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>); infection, integration of DNA into the host chromosome and production of virions cause apparently no phenotype change but a significant growth retardation of the host cells which can be visualized as turbid plaques around propagation foci on plated lawns of indicator host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>More recently, another fusellovirus, SSV2 from <italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic> strain 15/4 was isolated, characterized and its complete genomic sequence determined. SSV2 shares with SSV1 similar morphology, replication and DNA size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The overall genome architecture is conserved but the low similarity in the sequences should be responsible for the higher copy number and the lack of a strong ultraviolet induction of episomal SSV2 DNA and particle production, as well as for the different integration of the SSV2 genome which occurs into the host chromosome at the site of a glycyl tRNA instead of arginyl-tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p><italic>S.islandicus</italic> REY15/4 harbors also a small plasmid, pSSVx, assigned to the pRN family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) of <italic>Sulfolobales</italic> plasmids; pSSVx is also capable of spreading in the cell cultures of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> but only in the presence of either SSV2 or SSV1, necessary as helpers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In fact, pSSVx contains two open reading frames showing high-sequence similarity to a tandem of ORFs in both SSV1 and SSV2 genomes; the proteins encoded by these ORFs are probably necessary for specific recognition of the pSSVx DNA but need viral helper components for capsid formation and packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>In general, the choice of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> as a model for fundamental understanding of the genetics of extremely thermophilic archaea is due to growth conditions operatively non-prohibitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) and capability of maintaining and propagating either natural or genetically modified extrachromosomal DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) from other sources. The complete genome of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> has also been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), the biochemical characterization of many gene products obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and the development of post-genomics tools such as proteomics and metabolic pathway reconstruction recently attempted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).

The different recombinant <italic>Escherichia coli&#x02013;Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> shuttle vectors constructed retained the wild-type capability to replicate at high copy-number and to spread in cell cultures in the presence of its helper virus SSV2. <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> transformants were demonstrated to be stable and propagate the pSSVx derived plasmids in a reproducible and constant fashion without any rearrangement, recombination or integration into the chromosome.</p><p>Moreover, stable complementation of a &#x003b2;-galactosidase mutant of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> previously isolated and characterized in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and reproducible gene expression levels were also obtained by introducing the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene (<italic>lacS</italic>) as a reporter under the control of a strong and heat-inducible promoter into the shuttle vector.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Growth of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> strains and isolation of SSV2-infected <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> G&#x003b8;W and P2</title><p><italic>S.solfataricus</italic> strains P2 (DSM 1617), G&#x003b8; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and the derivative mutant G&#x003b8;W [&#x00394;<italic>lacS</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>)] as well as <italic>S.islandicus</italic> REY 15/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) were grown at 75 or 80&#x000b0;C in glycine buffered Brock's medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) with 0.1% tryptone, 0.05% yeast extract and 0.2% sucrose at pH 3.2. For electroporation and plaque assays, cells were grown with phosphate buffered medium N.182 (M182) suggested by the DSMZ Catalogue of strains containing 0.1% glucose. For isolation of independent clones, medium M182 contained only 0.25% lactose and no other nutrient. The optical density of liquid cultures was monitored at 600 nm. For solid media, gellan gum (Gelrite, Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.8% (0.35% for overlays), and MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> were added to 10.0 and 3.0 mM, respectively.</p><p>The <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> strains G&#x003b8;W and P2 transfected with the SSV2 and pSSVx were extracted from zones of growth inhibition (plaques) formed on indicator lawns around spots of the <italic>S.islandicus</italic> REY 15/4 culture supernatants (2&#x02013;6 &#x003bc;l for each spot), as described by Arnold <italic>et al</italic>.

Clones with insertion at the specific position were selected by restriction analysis of the resulting plasmid collection. A size reduced derivative of pSSVrt was also constructed; the polycloning sequence (between the AatII and EcoRI sites) of the pUC28 vector was inserted into a 1812 bp AatII/AflIII DNA fragment from pUC18 after suitable modification of incompatible ends.

A 200 bp segment was identified which contains the tail-to-tail intergenic region between the ORFs C68 and 288. The segment shows archaeal transcription termination signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) and tendency to form hairpin loops as for rho-independent termination mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Moreover, it has an AflIII site (cut at the position 2812 on the pSSVx genome), useful for cloning, since it is situated in the 3&#x02032; direction beyond the ORF288 transcription termination region, and far upstream of the ORF c68 stop codon. Since the AflIII site is present in five copies on the pSSVx sequence (positions 677, 814, 982, 2812 and 4994), singly cut pSSVx genomes were generated by digestion with the restriction enzyme under conditions that allowed single cleavage of the DNA molecules presumably at every specific site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). After suitable modification of termini, these DNAs were inserted into <italic>E.coli</italic> pUC19 plasmid vector and specific insertion at the position 2812 produced the fusion plasmid pSSVrt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>pSSVrt shuttle vector transfection and spreading</title><p>The plasmid DNA pSSVrt selected from <italic>E.coli</italic> was transferred by electroporation into <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>, using different strains, namely SSV2 lysogens of the strains P2, MT4 and G&#x003b8;W, which is a stable &#x003b2;-galactosidase mutant with an extended deletion in the <italic>lacS</italic> genetic locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). To test transformation efficiency, <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> was transformed with varying amounts of the plasmid pSSVrt (10&#x02013;100 ng) and then checked for the presence and amount of the vector at different cell densities and after several generations. Three hours after electroporation no extrachromosomal DNA could be detected, confirming the low transformation efficiency already determined both by Schleper <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and Cannio <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Nevertheless the plasmid pSSVrt spread efficiently throughout a culture after transformation; in fact after the first scale-up from 3 to 50 ml of the culture, the amount of the plasmid and of the helper virus SSV2 increased and could be detected by ethidium bromide fluorescence on agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Identical results were obtained with all the different DNA concentrations used for electroporation but a lower amount (&#x0223c;5-fold) of the hybrid plasmid could be detected in the P2 and MT4 (data not shown) strains when compared with the G&#x003b8;W strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the same experiments performed on wild-type strains not infected with SSV2 produced no transformation by the shuttle vector, confirming the need of the helper virus for the propagation of the engineered plasmid.</p><p>A long-term growth experiment was also carried out with transformed <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> G&#x003b8;W.

At this point samples were withdrawn at different cell densities and the DNA from the cells was analyzed; no change in the DNA replication and accumulation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) even after storing the propagated culture as a frozen &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C glycerol stock and repeating the dilution/growth cycles. The relative fluorescence intensities of the pSSVrt and pSSVx were almost identical and the comparison with DNA fragments loaded at known concentrations on the gels allowed the estimation of &#x0223c;130 and 150 copies per cell (density of 1.0&#x02013;1.2 OD<sub>600</sub>) for the engineered and the unmodified viral DNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>pSSVx-derived shuttle vectors for the <italic>lac</italic>S gene transfer and expression in the &#x003b2;-galactosidase deficient mutant G&#x003b8;W</title><p>&#x003b2;-D-galactosidase activity of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> is displayed by the <italic>lacS</italic> gene product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) and is responsible for the typical blue stain of the cells when exposed to the chromogenic substrate, X-gal; the lack of gene function in defective mutant strains is hence responsible for colorless colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). The <italic>lacS</italic> coding sequence with a 648 bp 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) was fused to a 448 bp fragment containing the promoter region of tf55&#x003b1; and the first five codons of its ORF; this 2578 bp expression cassette was inserted into the polycloning site of the pSSVrt vector, increasing its size to &#x0223c;11 kb. A similar gene fusion was already demonstrated to efficiently complement a &#x003b2;-galactosidase defect in <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> when carried by a viral SSV1-derived shuttle vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The plasmid was used to transform the strain G&#x003b8;W (&#x00394;<italic>lacS</italic>) and after electroporation, cell culture was regenerated to allow spreading and subsequently seeded as spots onto plates as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). After 2&#x02013;3 days of incubation, the colonized areas were overlaid with X-gal and reincubated at 75&#x000b0;C. No color was developed even after prolonged incubation, namely no expression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity could be detected, suggesting the failure of the recombinant plasmid to transport and/or to express the <italic>lacS</italic> gene. Extrachromosomal DNA preparation did not contain the recombinant pSSVx confirming that interference could have occurred either at the level of DNA propagation or of the recombinant particle proliferation/spreading. Southern analysis of extrachromosomal DNAs from this primary transformants demonstrated that the DNA transfer and maintenance were unaffected whereas spreading was impeded, as indicated by specific bands that could be detected at constant but very weak intensity for cells withdrawn at different generation stages (data not shown). To confirm this preliminary results a size reduction of the pSSVrt vector was obtained by eliminating a redundant sequence in the <italic>E.coli</italic> plasmid moiety not necessary for replication and ampicillin selection and producing the vector pMSSV. Moreover a smaller (2025 bp) <italic>lacS</italic> expression cassette provided by Dr C. Schleper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and containing a shorter 3&#x02032;-UTR replaced the one used in the first attempt. This <italic>lacS</italic> expression cassette was inserted into the polycloning site of pMSSV, generating the expression vector pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Both pMSSV and pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> were transferred into <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> G&#x003b8;W/SSV2 cells by electroporation, whereas pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> was also transferred into cells of the P2/SSV2 strain. After culture propagation, extrachromosomal DNAs were prepared and analyzed by agarose electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The presence and growth-dependent accumulation of both vectors in G&#x003b8;W/SSV2 and of pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> in P2/SSV2 revealed successful transformation and DNA replication, confirming that the plasmid size was critical for particle formation and spreading; moreover the <italic>lacS</italic> gene is harmless and does not induce recombination of the vector also in the P2 strain which already contains a wild-type chromosomal copy of the gene. Identical results were obtained when SSV2 lysogens of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> G&#x003b8;W were transformed with the plasmid pSSVx<italic>lacS</italic> lacking the <italic>E.coli</italic> sequences and obtained by cleavage with <italic>Sac</italic>I and re-ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). All pSSVx derived plasmid failed to transform <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> if linearized prior to transfer. In fact, X-Gal staining test was positive on <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> G&#x003b8;W/SSV2 transformed with pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> (or pSSVx<italic>lacS</italic>, data not shown) on liquid-cultured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), plated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and primary infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Plaques depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> stained after incubation with the chromogenic substrate as a result of propagation of the engineered satellite virus. Since cell growth retardation in the plaques is directly proportional to the SSV2 virus titer which is maximal in the stationary phase cultures (P. Contursi, unpublished data), turbidity and color faded progressively with increasing cell density.</p><p>Therefore, the &#x003b2;-galactosidase was expressed from the recombinant plasmid and the engineered satellite virus had spread efficiently throughout the culture.</p><p>pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> DNA prepared from <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> could be re-transferred into <italic>E.coli</italic> without suffering recombinational rearrangements. Plasmid preparations and total DNA from <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> transformants were analysed by restriction analyses and Southern hybridization that confirmed the maintenance of the vector at the same levels of the parental pSSVrt. No vector integration into the host chromosome occurred since the recombinant vector exhibited the same restriction pattern as the DNA prepared from <italic>E.coli</italic> and no signal relative to the plasmid could be detected on genomic DNAs in the Southern blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Bands corresponding to chromosomal <italic>tf55&#x003b1;</italic> promoter (in all strains tested) and <italic>lac</italic>S gene (absent in G&#x003b8;W) could also be visualized as internal controls for detection of single copy chromosomal sequences. Signal assignment of the restriction fragments of <italic>tf55&#x003b1;</italic> gene was performed on the basis of the sequence and localization on the P2 strain genome, whereas the mapping performed by Bartolucci <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) allowed the identification of <italic>lacS</italic> gene specific signals. A similar Southern analysis confirmed that the pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> copy number varied from 10&#x02013;15 (mid-log phase) to &#x0223c;130 molecules per cell (stationary phase).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of single pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> transfectants</title><p>Single colonies formed by suitably diluted mid exponential pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> transformant cells (0.3 OD<sub>600</sub>) on rich solid medium (M182, glucose 0.1%) resulted positive to X-Gal staining only in the fraction of 1&#x02013;3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>; below this cell density value the presence of the plasmid was undetectable in plated cells. The fraction of positive clones could be increased to 40% when stationary phase cultures were plated, namely when the plasmid had reached its maximum copy number per cell. Unfortunately, blue stained clones loosed the recombinant plasmid when suspended and directly propagated in liquid cultures as indicated by the analysis on extrachromosomal DNA and negative staining with X-Gal. This result was nevertheless expected, since also wild-type pSSVx has been demonstrated to be lost in cells of single colonies on plates and/or of progressively diluted cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>); indeed we confirmed and took advantage of this feature for the SSV2 lysogen selection of G&#x003b8;W and P2.</p><p>In order to stabilize the pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> transformants, selection on minimal media containing lactose as the only nutrient source was performed (cells not complemented for <italic>lacS</italic> function are unable to grow because of the lack of any &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Streaking (and/or seeding of suitable dilutions) revealed that the culture had 100% colony forming efficiency on lactose. Moreover, all colonies resulted positive in the X-Gal test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), demonstrating that they were able to retain the plasmid under selective nutrient conditions. Interestingly, cells plated as spots after resuspension and immediate re-seeding onto rich medium, maintained the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (for the analysis of 10 independent clones see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This procedure (resuspension and immediate re-seeding) overcame critical dilution and was successful also for the smaller fraction of positive transformants isolated from solid rich medium.</p><p>These experiments demonstrate that cultures of pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> transformants before selection on plates were homogeneously infected (all cells contained the plasmid) and that in diluted cell suspensions (such as those necessary for single colony formation on plates and/or obtained by transfer of single colonies in liquid medium), actively dividing cells loosed the vector, unless a selective pressure was imposed.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;-galactosidase assays on pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> transfectants</title><p>Detection of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity on denaturing gels by enzyme staining revealed that the <italic>lacS</italic> gene product was indistinguishable when expressed as heterologous in <italic>E.coli</italic> and xenologous in <italic>S.solfataricus</italic>, namely the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> expression system did not interfere with the correct polypeptide syntesis (data not shown).</p><p>&#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was measured using a spectrophotometric assay with the specific substrate ONPG in crude cell extracts of both transfected mutant G&#x003b8;W strain and wild type G&#x003b8;. The mutant recipient strain G&#x003b8;W has been shown to exhibit no detectable activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), whereas the specific activities of pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> transformants in primary transformation mixtures rose from undetectable levels to 1.2 U/mg protein; this value was &#x0223c;2-fold higher than that found in wild-type cells expressing <italic>lacS</italic> under the control of its own promoter. The activity remained stable in diluted and propagated cells cultured as described above, when assays were performed at the same growth phase. Under identical growth conditions, the value of endogenous &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in the P2 wild-type strain (i.e. the natural source of both the <italic>lacS</italic> gene and <italic>tf55&#x003b1;</italic> promoter sequences inserted in the pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic>), reached 0.1 U/mg as the highest value. Therefore, using this value as reference the expression level in G&#x003b8;W/pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> is &#x0223c;12-fold higher. For a single culture, activity increased up to late logarithmical growth phase and then maintained approximately the same value up to late stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This result confirmed that the recombinant satellite viral DNA was replicated inside the cells and that virus particle formed and spread throughout the culture; the increasing activity should therefore depend only on the copy number of the plasmid and hence on the number of the <italic>lacS</italic> gene copies per cell.</p><p>Heat shock of the stably transfected cells, shifting the culture temperature from 75&#x000b0; to 88&#x000b0;C, induced an increase of the specific activity up to 2.5-fold (3.0 U/mg) after 3 h and remained constant in cells exposed to thermal stress for 24 h.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this paper, we have developed a relatively small-sized and high copy number shuttle vector for <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> based on the satellite virus pSSVx from <italic>S.islandicus</italic> REY15/4.</p><p>An extended intergenic region between the still uncharacterized ORFs c68 and 288 on the pSSVx genome sequence appeared potentially useful for inserting foreign DNA. In fact, the vector pSSVrt clearly showed efficient replication and maintenance in SSV2 lysogens of the strains G&#x003b8;W and P2.</p><p>The insertion of foreign sequences into the pSSVrt vector allowed also to determine the limiting upper size (&#x0223c;11 kb) of the DNA to be accommodated in the virus particles. The additional sequences severely affected packaging and spreading rather than the transfer and/or the replication/maintenance of the viral DNA. These results also indicated that transport in viable virions and no other mechanism, such as conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>), is responsible for cell-to-cell transfer of this genetic element.</p><p>A &#x02018;minimal&#x02019; vector pMSSV was devised to accommodate inserts of a wider size range at least up to the 2.0 kb of a smaller <italic>tf55&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>lacS</italic> expression cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In fact, the deletion of a region non-essential for replication and selection in <italic>E.coli</italic> and a shortened <italic>lacS</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR resulted in an efficient shuttle vector able to transform <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> and to spread in primary cultures. The vector did not suffer either integration into the host chromosome or rearrangements and resided with undetectable to 130 copies per chromosome, the number depending on the cell growth phase. Interestingly, &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in complemented mutant cells followed an increasing trend which correlated to the plasmid accumulation up to stationary phase and was not dependent on the number of the generations. <italic>lacS</italic> gene expression was inducible by thermal stress, namely it was confirmed to be transcriptionally regulated by the chaperonin gene promoter. However, heat shock did not produce the same &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity increase (&#x0223c;10-fold) described by Jonuscheit <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), although maximum gene expression resulted at comparable levels in the two host/vector systems (3 versus 5 U/mg).</p><p>Maximum size for DNA insertion into pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> was determined to be &#x0223c;1.3 kb (data not shown). In principle longer inserts up to 3.1 kb can be accommodated after cloning in <italic>E.coli</italic> and excision of the bacterial sequences prior to the transfer into <italic>Sulfolobus</italic>.</p><p>Maintenance of pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> in early exponential grown and/or plated cells seemed to be the critical point for the efficacy of this system, because of both the low copy number (this work) and the reduced viral production in metabolically active cells (P. Contursi, unpublished data). In fact, segregation of the plasmid in an actively dividing cell (in which SSV2 is also maintained at low copy number and hence hardly sustains active replication and/or particle proliferation of pSSVx and derivatives) can be very asymmetrical until it is lost. We were able to overcome this bottleneck; as expected, efficient selection and stabilization of single pMSSV<italic>lacS</italic> transformants was indeed obtained by plating cells grown up to stationary phase (maximum copy number and highest viral production), by avoiding critical dilutions in the resuspension of single colonies and/or by imposing selective metabolic pressure in lactose minimal media.</p><p>This system presents many advantages compared with others already mentioned: (i) after DNA transfer, the vector propagates efficiently throughout the culture as a virus, overcoming the usual low transformation efficiency of <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> cells; (ii) the vector is stably maintained at high-copy number with no integration into the chromosome and hence no reduction in the number of episomal molecules and (iii) in stable transfectants, the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity is dependent only on the copy number of the vector.</p><p>The availability of this new two-element transformation systems based on SSV2 and the engineered pSSVx will contribute to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the satellite/helper dependence as well as for replication, gene regulation and packaging of the episomal DNAs.</p><p>Further work will explore the use of this vector for the expression of both homologous and heterologous genes in <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> as well as for testing <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> regulatory sequences.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Prof. Quinxin She for providing us with the strain REY 15/4 of <italic>S.islandicus</italic>.

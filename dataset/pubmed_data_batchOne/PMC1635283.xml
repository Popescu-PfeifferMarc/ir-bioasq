Representatives of the <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme class function as metabolite-sensing riboswitches whose self-cleavage activities down-regulate the expression of GlmS enzymes that synthesizes GlcN6P. As with other riboswitches, natural <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme isolates are highly specific for their target metabolite. Other small molecules closely related to GlcN6P, such as glucose-6-phosphate, cannot activate self-cleavage. We applied <italic>in vitro</italic> selection methods in an attempt to identify variants of a <italic>Bacillus cereus glmS</italic> ribozyme that expand the range of compounds that induce self-cleavage. In addition, we sought to increase the number of variant ribozymes of this class to further examine the proposed secondary structure model. Although numerous variant ribozymes were obtained that efficiently self-cleave, none exhibited changes in target specificity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that GlcN6P is used by the ribozyme as a coenzyme for RNA cleavage, rather than an allosteric effector.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Riboswitches are structured RNA elements that most commonly reside within the 5&#x02032;-untranslated regions (UTRs) of bacterial mRNAs where they control gene expression via direct binding of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). A variety of natural ligands or effector molecules including coenzymes, amino acids and nucleobases are selectively sensed by natural aptamer domains that distinguish each riboswitch class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Each aptamer is usually closely associated with an expression platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), which interfaces with factors that are responsible for expressing genes. Ligand binding typically stabilizes one structural state of a riboswitch aptamer, and this alters the folding pathway taken by the expression platform located immediately downstream of (or sometimes overlapping) the aptamer.</p><p>The vast majority of riboswitches in bacteria appear to control gene expression by modulating transcription termination or translation initiation. Computer-aided nucleotide sequence analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) reveal that many riboswitch aptamers reside upstream of a strong hairpin loop followed by a short repeat of U residues. This architecture conforms to the structure of known intrinsic transcription terminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), and some riboswitches have been experimentally demonstrated to modulate transcription termination upon ligand binding <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Likewise, bioinformatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and biochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) studies have revealed that riboswitches also use ligand-dependent differential base pairing to control accessibility of ribosome binding sites within some mRNAs.</p><p>As with most other riboswitches, <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) are located in mRNAs that encode proteins involved in the metabolism or transport of the compound that is being detected. The protein encoded by <italic>glmS</italic> mRNAs, <sc>l</sc>-glutamine:fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase, is an enzyme that produces GlcN6P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is selectively recognized by <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). GlcN6P production is the first step in the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc. This nucleotide-modified glucosamine compound is used in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis and is essential for bacterial cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>Several characteristics of <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes are unique among riboswitches, which suggest they control gene expression using a distinct regulatory mechanism. The most prominent difference is that <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes undergo efficient site-specific self-cleavage in the presence of GlcN6P. When saturated with GlcN6P, the rate constant for self-cleavage is &#x0223c;3 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). This corresponds to a rate acceleration of at least 10-million-fold over the uncatalyzed rate for RNA transesterification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Self-cleavage occurs via a phosphoester transfer reaction in which the 2&#x02032; oxygen of the labile linkage functions as a nucleophile and attacks the phosphate at the cleavage site. The products of the cleavage reaction possess a 5&#x02032;-hydroxyl group and a 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate. The cleavage site resides within the 5&#x02032;-UTR of each <italic>glmS</italic> mRNA, and therefore the riboswitch does not directly deactivate translation by disrupting the continuity of the open reading frame (ORF). Although the precise mechanism for gene control has yet to be established, ribozyme activity is known to be essential for gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>The results of several previous studies indicate that the <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme forms a series of base-paired structures and unpaired but conserved nucleotides that are important for ribozyme folding and catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). These results also suggest that the ribozyme is highly selective for GlcN6P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) and that this ligand might function as a coenzyme for RNA transesterification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). One possibility is that the 2-amino group of GlcN6P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) is responsible for proton transfer during cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage. In the current study, we have used <italic>in vitro</italic> selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) to determine whether variant <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes could be isolated that exhibit altered ligand specificity, and to further examine the structural model for this ribozyme class. We speculated that if the <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme uses GlcN6P as a coenzyme, then it might not be possible to isolate close variants of the parent ribozyme that use GlcN6P analogs that lack a 2-amino group of the natural ligand.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals and oligonucleotides</title><p>GlcN6P and various analogs were purchased from Sigma, except for GlcNol6P, &#x003b1;-MeOGlcN6P and &#x003b2;-MeOGlcN6P, which were synthesized as reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).

These stems are distributed between the catalytic core domain of the ribozyme (P1, P2, P2.1 and P2.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) and an accessory domain (P3, P3.1, P4 and P4.1) that permits the catalytic core to function when incubated with physiologically relevant concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Together these domains span 142 contiguous nucleotides, beginning 1 nt upstream of the cleavage site and ending at nt 141 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The starting pool of variant ribozymes was generated by introducing mutations at 122 of the 142 nt that encompass the <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme from <italic>B.cereus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see also Materials and Methods section). A degeneracy in nucleotide identity of 0.09 was introduced at each mutagenized position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), to yield RNAs where these sites have a 91% chance of carrying the wild-type nucleotide and a 3% chance of carrying one of the other 3 nt. Approximately 200 pmol (1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>14</sup> molecules) of DNA template was used to produce the starting RNA population (G0), providing complete coverage of all 6-error mutants. Subsequent populations included 10 pmoles of RNA, each prepared by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription in the absence of ligands. Full-length precursor RNAs were purified by denaturing 6% PAGE and subsequently incubated in selection buffer supplemented with 200 &#x003bc;M each of eight compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The resulting 3&#x02032; cleavage products carrying the randomized ribozyme domains were purified by denaturing 6% PAGE and amplified by RT&#x02013;PCR. One iteration of this selective-amplification process constitutes one round of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection.</p><p>Eight compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were added to the initial <italic>in vitro</italic> selection reactions. Three of these compounds (GlcN6P, GlcN6S and GlcN) are known to activate the wild-type <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme from <italic>B.cereus</italic> under conditions used in this study for <italic>in vitro</italic> selection, although GlcN6S and GlcN likely are bound far less tightly than is GlcN6P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Since these three compounds activate the wild-type ribozyme, their inclusion in the <italic>in vitro</italic> selection reactions would allow us to isolate ribozyme variants that retained activity with the natural ligand. Moreover, any mutations that improved the affinity or activity of the ribozyme with the less effective ligands might be recovered. The remaining five ligands (Glc, Glc6P, GlcNol6P, &#x003b1;-MeOGlcN6P and &#x003b2;-MeOGlcN6P) do not exhibit significant activation of wild-type ribozyme self-cleavage even when present at a concentration of 1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). The addition of these compounds to the <italic>in vitro</italic> selection reactions should permit the isolation of ribozyme variants that could use these normally inactive compounds to promote cleavage if such variants were sufficiently close in sequence space to be present in the RNA population.</p></sec><sec><title>Ligand-binding properties of a <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme resist alteration</title><p>The RNA population resulting from two rounds of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection (G2) was found to exhibit considerable activation of ribozyme function when a mixture of the eight compounds was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Systematic analysis of the effects of adding individual compounds revealed that the G3 RNA population mostly contained ribozymes that respond to GlcN6P (data not shown). The G3 population was split into two lineages (I and II) to permit separate attempts to optimize activity with GlcN6P and to determine if variant ribozymes could be isolated that broaden ligand specificity.</p><p>Lineage I was extended by an additional 13 rounds of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection using only GlcN6P as a ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As the rounds progressed, the concentration of GlcN6P was decreased from 200 to 2 &#x003bc;M to favor isolation of ribozyme variants that react fast even when low concentrations of ligand are provided. The observed rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>) values for each population were established at the concentrations used for the corresponding <italic>in vitro</italic> selection reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A total of 10 of these additional rounds of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection were carried out in the presence of 2 &#x003bc;M GlcN6P. However, the <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> values for the resulting populations never substantially exceeded the <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> value exhibited by the wild-type ribozyme (0.015 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) under the same assay conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that there is not an abundance of sequence variants of <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes that can bind GlcN6P more tightly and retain robust RNA cleavage activity.</p><p>Similarly, lineage II was extended by an additional round of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection in the presence of 200 &#x003bc;M each of the seven GlcN6P analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> population G3). We observed that the RNA population at G4 of lineage II exhibited activity only when presented with GlcN6S (data not shown). This population was split into two to further propagate lineage II and to create lineage III (see below).</p><p>An additional nine rounds of selection were conducted with lineage II (G4&#x02013;G12) using only 200 &#x003bc;M GlcN6S as the ligand. As was observed with lineage I, RNA populations from each round exhibited <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> values in the presence of 200 &#x003bc;M GlcN6S that were no greater than that observed for the wild-type ribozyme (<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> &#x0223c;0.02 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Again, these results suggest either that the ligand-binding domain of this <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme cannot easily be mutated to alter its molecular recognition characteristics, or that mutations altering molecular recognition adversely affect ribozyme cleavage.</p><p>Lineage III was subjected to nine additional rounds of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection with the remaining six GlcN6P-related compounds. Although the RNA populations from each round continually exhibited a modest response to the compound mixture, this response was very low and was determined to be a result of the addition of GlcN (data not shown). The GlcN-triggered activity was considered to be similar to that expected with the wild-type <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme, which also suggests that the ribozyme cannot easily adapt to improve its use of GlcN as an inducer of ribozyme activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation locations in variant ribozymes support existing structural and functional models</title><p>As with other riboswitches and ribozymes, each <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme conforms to a specific secondary structure architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and carries a set of conserved nucleotides that defines this class of RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We have previously determined that ribozymes in this class use two functional domains that separately serve as a ligand-dependent self-cleaving ribozyme and as an accessory domain that accelerates ribozyme cleavage at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). If the structural and functional models for this ribozyme class are accurate, then the active ribozymes isolated in this study should carry mutations that conform to these models. More specifically, it is likely that nucleotides in the parent <italic>glmS</italic> RNA that bind ligand and promote catalysis will reside in the most highly conserved portion of the ribozyme. Furthermore, if the ribozymes isolated in this study do not exhibit altered kinetic or molecular recognition characteristics towards GlcN6P or its analogs, then we expect that variants comprising the <italic>in vitro</italic> selection populations should not carry mutations in the conserved core.</p><p>We investigated this hypothesis by cloning and sequencing individual ribozyme variants from G16 of lineage I and G12 of lineage II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; see also Supplementary Figure S1). Of 20 clones examined from lineage I, only one retains the parental <italic>B.cereus glmS</italic> ribozyme sequence. The remaining 19 individuals have an average of 4.4 mutations per molecule. One variant from this lineage (clone A10) was assayed and was found to exhibit essentially wild-type activity with GlcN6P (data not shown), which is consistent with the activity of the G16 population from lineage I.</p><p>None of the lineage I variants carries a mutation at any of the nucleotides conserved at &#x02265;97%, and none of the mutations occurs at residues that are predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) to be critical for binding the phosphate of the ligand. Furthermore, many of the mutations cluster in regions that form stems P3, P3.1, P4 and P4.1. This accessory domain allows the ribozyme to attain maximal activity in low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), but is not essential for ligand-induced ribozyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Given that the <italic>in vitro</italic> selection reactions were conducted at a relatively high concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (10 mM), the isolation of numerous variants that tolerate mutations in this accessory domain is expected based on its proposed function. Overall, these findings are consistent with our expectation that ribozyme variants with wild-type-like activity should not carry mutations in the core of the ribozyme.</p><p>Similarly, sequencing of 17 clones from G12 of lineage II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and Supplementary Figure S2) produced a single example of the parental <italic>B.cereus glmS</italic> ribozyme. Only one individual (clone B13) carries a mutation at a site within the catalytic core that is most highly conserved. However, this RNA fails to exhibit measurable self-cleavage activity (data not shown). The remaining 15 individuals each contain an average of 3.4 mutations per molecule and, as with the variants from lineage I, the locations of these mutations are compatible with the structural and functional models for this ribozyme class.</p><p>It is notable that nearly half the clones examined in both lineages have a mutation from G to A at nt 61 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent changes in nucleotide sequence at specific sites usually indicate that the mutation provides some selective advantage, and therefore could be reflective of a phenotypic change from the parent <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme. Nucleotide sequences recorded in GenBank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) reveal that <italic>B.cereus</italic> and <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> bacterial strains carry two extra nucleotides located in the junction between P2 and P2.2 compared to <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes from other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). These 2 nt, corresponding to positions 61 and 62 of the <italic>B.cereus</italic> parent sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), are A and C, respectively, in nearly all strains of <italic>B.cereus</italic> and <italic>B.anthracis</italic> in GenBank. A single exception is the strain used in our studies (<italic>B.cereus</italic> ATCC 10&#x02009;987), which carries G and C at these sites. Therefore, the frequent mutation of G to A at position 61 results in a nucleotide sequence that matches most natural <italic>glmS</italic> sequences from <italic>B.cereus</italic> and <italic>B.anthracis</italic>. Therefore, this commonly occurring mutation is not indicative of a fundamental change in ribozyme activity, but is a mutation that yields a sequence more commonly observed in natural <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme isolates.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection results on the structure and action of <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes</title><p>In previous studies, <italic>in vitro</italic> selection strategies have been used to find mutations within aptamers that are able to compensate for changes in ligand structure. For example, variants of an RNA aptamer that selectively binds citrulline were isolated that preferentially bind arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). The global fold of both aptamers are strikingly similar and changes at only 3 nt are required to alter ligand specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). In another example, only a single nucleotide difference is required to change the ligand-binding preference of a theophylline aptamer to favor binding of 3-methylxanthine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Natural aptamers also can acquire altered ligand-binding characteristics with only modest changes in nucleotide sequence. Specifically, a single C-to-U mutation in the core of guanine riboswitches can switch ligand preference to adenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). These engineered and natural aptamers provide examples that prove RNAs can routinely adapt to small changes in ligand composition.</p><p>Our observation that the <italic>B.cereus glmS</italic> ribozyme has difficulty adapting to new ligands has implications for the structure and action of this ribozyme class. It has been suggested that <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes might use GlcN6P as a coenzyme to promote RNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), perhaps functioning as a general acid or general base catalyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). If true, it might be more difficult for <italic>glmS</italic> RNAs to acquire mutations that alter molecular recognition characteristics while preserving the ability of the RNA to properly position or activate the cofactor for catalytic function.</p><p>Furthermore, GlcN6P analogs that lack an intact ring structure, that lack the 2-amino group, or that have an altered p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of the 2-amino group exhibit little or no ability to induce <italic>glmS</italic> ribozyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Compounds that either have an open ring structure (GlcNol6P) or that lack the 2-amino group (Glc; Glc6P) were present in our <italic>in vitro</italic> selection reactions, but no variants were found that could use these compounds. If the 2-amino group is directly involved in the chemical step of ribozyme cleavage, then GlcN6P analogs that lack an amine are not likely to substitute as a cofactor even for variants of this ribozyme class. However, the failure of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection to enrich for mutations that improve even modestly the ribozyme's activity in the presence of GlcNol6P, GlcN, GlcN6S or even GlcN6P suggests that the simultaneous demands that molecular recognition and catalytic activity place on the ribozyme cannot be altered with only a few mutations.</p><p>Moreover, it is notable that none of the three <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes derived from <italic>B.cereus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) or <italic>B.anthracis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) exhibits <italic>k</italic><sub>ob</sub><italic><sub>s</sub></italic> values greater then &#x0223c;3 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> when saturated with GlcN6P, although the rate constants for these ribozymes might be limited by folding and not by the chemical step of the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Regardless, our <italic>in vitro</italic> selection results suggest that improvements in the overall speed of RNA cleavage might also be difficult to achieve within the context of this ribozyme class. It has been noted that <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes have kinetic characteristics that are consistent with a ribozyme that uses in-line positioning of attacking and leaving groups, and uses activation of the 2&#x02032;-oxygen nucleophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) to accelerate RNA cleavage. If <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes use these two catalytic strategies to the exclusion of all other mechanisms for RNA cleavage, then the maximum <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> values observed for the constructs tested might be close to the maximum theoretically possible for such enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our exploration into the possibility of altering the ligand-binding specificity of <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes contributes to several aspects of riboswitch research and application. Variant ribozymes that retain function with the natural ligand GlcN6P carry patterns of mutations that are easily reconciled with the nucleotide sequence phylogeny of natural <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes. This indicates that the nucleotide sequences and structures that are most conserved in the natural examples are important for molecular recognition and catalysis, as opposed to the possibility that they are present exclusively for some other biological function.</p><p>Similarly, the fact that no variant ribozymes could be isolated that exhibit improved ligand affinity or altered ligand specificity suggests that <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes might not be very receptive to changes at the ligand-binding site. If this ribozyme class uses the ligand as a coenzyme versus as an allosteric effector, then the simultaneous demands that molecular recognition and accurate coenzyme positioning place on an RNA molecule should make it more difficult to encounter variants that productively alter both functions.</p><p>Finally, engineered fusions between aptamers and ribozymes can be made to function as precision biosensors for various ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Constructs adapted from <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes also have been used as fluorescent reporter systems for conducting high-throughput screens for compounds that trigger riboswitch function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Similar assays with other GlcN6P analogs, including glucose or glucose-6-phosphate could find utility as reporters for these compounds both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, our data suggest that <italic>glmS</italic> ribozymes are not be predisposed to serve as the best starting points for molecular engineers who seek to create such sensors.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Adam Roth for design of the construct for <italic>in vitro</italic> selection, and Jinsoo Lim for synthesis of GlcNol6P, &#x003b1;-MeOGlcN6P and &#x003b2;-MeOGlcN6P.

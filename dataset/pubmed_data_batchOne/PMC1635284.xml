This RNP contains two platforms for the assembly of protein factors, the C/D and C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motifs, acting in conjunction with two guide sequences to direct methylation of a specific 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group in a target RNA. While this suggests that a functional asymmetric single-site complex complete with guide sequence and a single box C/D motif should be possible, previous work has demonstrated such constructs are not viable. To understand the basis for a bipartite RNP, we have designed and assayed the activity and specificity of a series of synthetic RNPs that represent a systematic reduction of the wild-type RNP to a fully single-site enzyme. This reduced RNP is active and exhibits all of the characteristics of wild-type box C/D RNPs except it is nonspecific with respect to the site of 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation. Our results demonstrate that protein&#x02013;protein crosstalk through Nop5p dimerization is not required, but that architecture plays a crucial role in directing methylation activity with both C/D and C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motifs being required for specificity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA is often modified in the cell in order for it to achieve full biological function. Currently, about 100 distinct types of modification have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). While most of these are exclusively observed in tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), other functional RNAs are also modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The importance of these modifications has become increasingly clear since the discovery that the two most common modification types in rRNA, pseudouridylation and 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation, cluster around the functional regions of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) suggesting that RNA modification may encourage proper folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and structural stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although biochemical data has supported this role in a number of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), other significant functions for RNA modification are continually emerging.</p><p>Box C/D ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes act as RNA guided site-specific 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferases in archaea and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In archaea, these complexes are referred to as small RNP complexes (sRNPs). This RNP specifically methylates a 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl in an RNA target with the site of methylation being the nucleotide paired to the guide sequence five bases upstream from either the D or the D&#x02032; box motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The archaeal box C/D RNA contains C&#x02032; and D&#x02032; motifs in the middle of the RNA that generally conform to the box C/D consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and two guide sequences of about 12 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). This architecture means that the box C/D complex is capable of site-specifically methylating two unique RNA targets with methylation directed off of either the D or D&#x02032; box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>The archaeal box C/D complex requires only three proteins for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>): L7Ae, which is also a ribosomal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), fibrillarin and the Nop56/Nop58 homolog Nop5p. L7Ae binds both box C/D and the C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), which respectively comprise kink-turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) or k-loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) to initiate the assembly of the RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Fibrillarin performs the transfer of the methyl group from the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). This reaction requires the precise positioning of the active site of fibrillarin over the specific 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group to be methylated. Interestingly, while fibrillarin methylates this functional group in the context of a Watson&#x02013;Crick base paired helix (guide/target), it has little dsRNA binding activity by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). This implies that its active site must be precisely positioned through interactions with the other components of the RNP.</p><p>Box C/D complexes possess a distinct but imperfect axis of symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). While archaeal and eukaryal box C/D complexes are extremely similar in their structure and sequence conservation, this symmetry is more explicit in archaea where there is: (i) less deviation of the C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motif from the consensus box C/D sequence, (ii) the presence of a single Nop56/Nop58 homolog that is proposed to form an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> tetramer with fibrillarin further reflecting a 2-fold symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), (iii) less guide sequence length variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and (iv) a more symmetric assembly of protein components onto the box C/D RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). However there is still debate over the exact composition of the functional complex. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) presents compelling evidence that the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> Nop5p/fibrillrin tetramer observed in a crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) may not be representative of the majority of archaeal box C/D RNPs. Instead, these proteins appear to be a functional heterodimer, with the coiled coil domain being essential for RNP function but not for mediating Nop5p dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>The conserved symmetry of this RNP led us to question the functional purpose of the bipartite architecture in box C/D complexes. If proper positioning of fibrillarin over the site of methylation is solely accomplished through interaction with proteins anchored to either the box C/D or C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motifs, then it would seem as if an active complex could be assembled using a single box C/D motif and guide sequence. To understand how the bipartite arrangement relates to activity and specificity we have designed a series of complexes representing intermediaries between a minimal asymmetric RNP and the wild-type enzyme. These constructs allowed us to assess the functional contributions of various aspects of box C/D architecture by building towards the full wild-type complex and looking for restoration of wild-type behavior at each step. This approach revealed an active monomeric enzyme exhibiting most of the characteristics of wild-type enzyme except that it is a highly nonspecific methyltransferase. We also found that protein&#x02013;protein cross talk through Nop5p dimerization is not required for specificity or activity. Significantly, other constructs revealed that the RNA architecture plays a crucial role in site-specifically directing methylation activity, with both the box C/D and C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motifs being required to achieve modification of the correct 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The gene encoding L7Ae (GI 7440708) was amplified from <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> genomic DNA by PCR and cloned into pET15b (Novagen) using standard techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).

For mNop5p, the coiled-coil domain was removed (139&#x02013;242 amino acids).

The molecular basis for this loss of activity remains unclear and the affect on methylation specificity has not been addressed. To understand the determinants of activity and specificity, we systematically deconstructed the symmetric archaeal box C/D sRNP. Initially, we created a minimal box C/D complex containing a single guide sequence representing a fully monomeric complex (termed hemi-complex, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) by engineering both the Nop5p protein and the box C/D sRNA.</p><p>Monomeric Nop5p homolog (referred to as mNop5p henceforth) was created by replacing the coiled-coil domain (139&#x02013;242 amino acids) with a Gly-Gly-Ala-Gly linker. The crystal structure of the <italic>A.fulgidus</italic> Nop5p/fibrillarin tetrameric complex revealed that dimerization of Nop5p is accomplished entirely by the coiled-coil domain; removal of this domain abrogates dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Removing the corresponding sequence from the <italic>P.horikoshii</italic> variant effectively abolished dimer formation as revealed by gel filtration. Full-length Nop5p elutes with a retention volume corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 127 kDa (true molecular weight for monomer is 45 kDa) consistent with formation of an elongated dimer; mNop5p elutes with an apparent molecular weight of 51 kDa (true molecular weight is 33 kDa) suggesting it behaves as a monomer (Figure 3a). The mixture of mNop5p/fibrillarin (&#x0223c;1:1) yielded two peaks when passed through the sizing column (Figure 3b). The first, which eluted with an apparent molecular weight of 80 kDa, contains both mNop5p and fibrillarin as judged by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (true molecular weight of 59 kDa for the heterodimer) while the second peak contains only fibrillarin (Figure 3c). Thus, mNop5p retains its ability to specifically bind fibrillarin, indicating that deletion of the coiled-coil has not impaired its ability to productively fold.</p><p>The RNA component of our initial hemi-complex was designed with the target sequence covalently attached to the guide region of the box C/D sRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This hemi-RNA contains a consensus box C/D motif with the C and D box sequences of AUGAUGA and CUGA, respectively that define the kink turn motif to which L7Ae binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). L7Ae was readily able to bind this RNA indicating that the core box C/D motif had not been perturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Before assaying the activity and specificity of the hemi-complex, the ability of the complex to assemble as a distinct RNP was investigated. A discrete shift of the hemi-RNA was observed upon each successive addition of L7Ae, mNop5p and fibrillarin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) consistent with observations of the wild-type RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Thus, the mNop5p construct was shown to be functional with regard to its interactions with fibrillarin and with the L7Ae/box C/D RNA complex as has been shown independently by Maxwell and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Surprisingly, complex assembly did not require elevated assembly temperatures (typically near 70&#x000b0;C) as had been observed in box C/D complexes derived from other thermophilic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). The bands for each assembly step of the box C/D complex were notably cleaner than those seen for the full complex, presumably because of the elimination of conformational heterogeneity in complexes containing the wild-type box C/D RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). This attribute greatly simplifies analysis of the binding affinity of components to the assembling RNP.</p></sec><sec><title>Hemi-complex gel mobility shifts</title><p>Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for assembly were determined by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), L7Ae displays a high affinity for box C/D containing RNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 12 &#x000b1; 5 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>) while mNop5p binds tightly to the L7Ae/hemi-RNA complex with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 69 &#x000b1; 14 nM. The affinity of mNop5p for the hemi-RNA in the absence of L7Ae is 347 &#x000b1; 47 nM, illustrating the requirement of L7Ae to promote recruitment of mNop5p and implying a stepwise assembly pathway with L7Ae binding to the RNA first followed by Nop5p and fibrillarin or a preassembled Nop5p&#x02013;fibrillarin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). The mNop5p/fibrillarin dimer has a slightly greater, but reproducible, affinity for the hemi-RNA&#x02013;L7Ae complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>) compared to the affinity of mNop5p alone. This suggests that fibrillarin either interacts with the RNA when positioned properly through association with the hemi-RNA&#x02013;L7Ae&#x02013;Nop5p complex or it enhances the affinity of Nop5p for the hemi-RNA&#x02013;L7Ae complex. The mNop5p/fibrillarin dimer binds only weakly to the hemi-RNA in the absence of L7Ae (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 611 &#x000b1; 50 nM). Likewise, fibrillarin binds to the hemi-RNA&#x02013;L7Ae complex with low affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x02265; 500 nM), indicating its interaction with the RNP complex is largely mediated through association with mNop5p. The accumulated binding data indicates that our engineering efforts did not adversely affect the ability of the box C/D hemi-complex to assemble through a set of high affinity interactions, clearly demonstrating that the normal protein&#x02013;RNA and protein&#x02013;protein interactions have been preserved in the hemi-complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Hemi-complex activity</title><p>The ability of the hemi-complex to perform the methyl group transfer reaction from <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine to a target strand RNA was investigated by an <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation assay using SAM containing a tritiated methyl group.

In order to be most sensitive to differences in methylation activity as changes are made to the box C/D complex, the apparent affinity of the hemi-complex for SAM was revealed by determining the degree of methylation as a function of SAM concentration. A titration of wild-type box C/D complex with SAM showed increasing amounts of methylation as the total SAM concentration was increased, with a maximal activity at &#x02248;150 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Fitting this data to a single-site binding model yields an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of &#x02248;22 &#x003bc;M, significantly higher than the SAM concentration used in other studies of methylation by the box C/D RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). The cellular concentration of SAM in the archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> was experimentally found to be between 70 and 90 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), which is on the same order of magnitude as values reported in the literature for a number of eukaryotic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>); this result is consistent with these reported intracellular SAM concentrations. For our experiments SAM concentrations were maintained at 50 &#x003bc;M to yield sufficient activity to allow discrimination between partially active and completely inactive complexes.</p><p>Initial experiments with the hemi-complex displayed very little methylation activity under previously reported conditions, consistent with prior work on partially asymmetric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). However, it was found that the activity exhibited a strong salt dependence. Magnesium ion concentration alone had little effect on activity in the absence of monovalent ions. However, at 3 M monovalent ions we observed significant enhancement in activity in the presence of 50&#x02013;100 mM magnesium (data not shown). Increasing concentrations of KCl yielded an observed maximal activity at around 2.0 M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). This requirement for elevated salt concentrations for methylation activity is likely due to the removal of the coiled-coil domain from Nop5p for two reasons. First, mNop5p tends to aggregate under low ionic strength conditions but is quite soluble at elevated salt concentrations (data not shown). Second, complexes assembled with hemi-RNA and wild-type Nop5p do not require high salt for activity. The hemi-complex was also found to be most active at temperatures near 75&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) in agreement with the temperature-activity profile of the wild-type archaeal box C/D RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). The amount of time required for the hemi-complex to achieve maximal methylation (&#x02248;10 min) was notably shorter than the times previously observed for wild-type box C/D complexes (&#x02265;40 min). We speculate that this may be in part a consequence of covalent attachment of the target sequence to the hemi-RNA by the GAAA tetraloop. The predicted melting temperature of the guide-target duplex without the GAAA tetraloop is about 50&#x000b0;C whereas the predicted melting temperature of the stem&#x02013;loop guide-target duplex is 118&#x000b0;C (Mfold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>) implying that substrate-guide pairing is maintained under the required elevated temperature for reaction (72&#x000b0;C). As we did not want an observed loss of activity to be due to incomplete guide/target annealing in subsequent experiments, care was taken with all constructs to ensure guide/target duplex stability at the temperature required for methylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Hemi-complex mismatch intolerance</title><p>The wild-type box C/D complex has been shown to be sensitive to mismatched base pairs at the fifth position within the guide-target sequence duplex, correlating to the site of 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). To investigate this behavior using the hemi-box C/D complex, a series of hemi-RNAs were designed with mismatches at positions 2&#x02013;8 relative to the box D motif. Mismatches were incorporated into the guide sequence to preserve the 5&#x02032;-transcription initiation sequence by replacing nucleotides in the guide with the identical nucleotide in the target sequence at each position tested. A mismatch placed at the fifth position in mNop5p complexes showed a significant, although incomplete, drop in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). A similar drop in activity occurs when non-Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs are present at neighboring positions three and four, while positions further removed from the expected site of methylation were unaffected by non-canonical base pairing. While this result hints at the occurrence of site-specific methylation, it also may reflect sensitivity to structural perturbations of the A-form helix in regions near the methylation site. However, the drop in activity observed is likely not due to changes in duplex stability because of the high melting temperature of the duplex; a single mismatched base pair yields a predicted guide-target melting temperature of 104&#x000b0;C, well above the reaction temperature. In two-piece systems, the decrease in guide-target melting temperature that occurs upon introduction of mismatches could potentially destabilize the duplex enough to account for significant loss of activity in and of itself (i.e. decrease in the activity due to lack of annealing rather than lack of duplex recognition).</p></sec><sec><title>The hemi-complex methylates target RNA non-specifically</title><p>To more clearly address the specificity of the hemi-complex, a two-piece hemi-box C/D RNA was designed for use with target RNAs containing single 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Removal of the 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl is expected to be minimally disruptive to duplex formation and A-form geometry but completely abrogates the reactive functional group and is therefore ideal for probing site-specific methylation. For instance, target RNA with a single 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl removed at the fifth position would display no methylation, as observed by transfer of the <sup>3</sup>H-methyl group from SAM, if the RNP were completely specific for methylation at that site, as is the wild-type box C/D RNP. Observation of a complete loss of activity upon removal of the position five hydroxyl and minimal loss of activity with the removal of neighboring hydroxyls would thus indicate site-specific methylation. A strong loss of activity at neighboring sites would reflect either deletion of 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl groups important for protein&#x02013;RNA interactions or be a result of the complex methylating at that position with some frequency due to loss of fifth position specificity. Targets used for these experiments contain deoxyribose substitutions at positions 3&#x02013;7 to thoroughly examine specificity.</p><p>The ability of the two-piece hemi-complex to specifically methylate its target RNA was examined under elevated salt conditions, as required for activity. Remarkably, removal of the hydroxyl at position five had little effect on the activity of the complex relative to its ability to methylate a control RNA containing no deoxy substitutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, expt. A), indicating the hemi-complex methylates the RNA at other sites. To determine if the site of methylation shifted to another 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl, targets with deoxys at neighboring positions 3&#x02013;7 were tested. No significant drop in activity was observed for any of these target RNAs. Furthermore, a target RNA with three 2&#x02032;-hydroxyls removed from positions 4&#x02013;6 exhibits only a slight decrease in activity (data not shown). In contrast, performing the same experiment with an RNA containing both the box C/D and C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; kink-turn motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) under low salt concentrations results in a complete loss of activity when the 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl at position five was removed while the activity was unaffected by removing any other 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl groups between positions 3 and 7 as expected for wild-type complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, expt. B). The full RNA contained a canonical K-turn motif at the C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; position rather than the single stem K-loop observed in <italic>Pyrococcus</italic> box C/D RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Clearly, the hemi-complex is competent to methylate RNA, but completely non-specific with respect to the position of methylation; conceivably this enzyme could also be methylating the guide strand as well.</p><p>The complete loss of specificity observed in the hemi-complex could be caused by a combination of the three alterations made to the wild-type box C/D complex. First, it may be the result of the removal of the coiled-coil domain from Nop5p. Second, the high salt conditions necessary for hemi-complex activity may abrogate specificity by interfering with important protein&#x02013;RNA contacts and the ability of fibrillarin to align with the guide-target duplex. Finally, the hemi-RNA itself may lack a specificity-conferring quality present in full box C/D RNAs. With these possibilities in mind, we began a systematic reconstruction of the full box C/D complex to identify the component that when restored rescues pinpoint specificity to determine the principal contributors to specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>Specificity is largely imparted by the RNA component</title><p>In the first step towards understanding specificity, a complex consisting of wild-type Nop5p and the two-piece hemi-RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) was assembled to test the effect of coiled-coil removal. The salt concentration was kept at 2 M to allow for direct comparison with mNop5p results. This complex displays a lack of specificity as evidenced by the significant activity seen for targets with a 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl removed from position 3&#x02013;7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, expt. C), as observed with the hemi-complex. Therefore, removal of the coiled-coil domain from Nop5p does not account for the loss of specificity observed in the hemi-complex.</p><p>To test the effect of high salt on specificity, full RNA complexes were assembled with full Nop5p at 2.0 M KCl and 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. This complex exhibits an increase in specificity levels as evidenced by a further decrease in the activity observed for position five-hydroxyl removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, expt. D). However, sensitivity to hydroxyl removal at neighboring positions 4 and 6 is present. Decreasing salt concentration to physiological levels (200 mM) alleviates the slight loss of methylation competency occuring upon removal of these neighboring hydroxyls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, expt. B). The requirement for the presence of flanking 2&#x02032;-hydroxyls at high ionic strength may be due to a weakening of electrostatic interactions between RNA and Nop5p/fibrillarin, which would increase the importance of hydrogen bonding with 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl groups. Thus, elevated ionic strength does not account for the loss of specificity observed although a small increase in specificity was seen for hemi-RNA complexes with full Nop under low ionic strength conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, expt. E).</p><p>Since neither restoration of the coiled-coil domain and Nop5p dimerization nor lowering ionic strength re-established specificity, the role of the RNA was investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Compared to the hemi-complexes, RNPs assembled with full RNA and mNop5p under high salt conditions (2.0 M) demonstrate a dramatic improvement in methylation specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, expt. F). However, this complex differed from the wild-type complex under physiological conditions in that a residual amount of activity was retained with removal of the fifth position hydroxyl. Also, sensitivity to removal of neighboring hydroxyls was observed. This is likely due to the elevated salt concentrations since wild-type complexes at 2 M salt exhibited the same sensitivity at neighboring positions while no such effect was seen at 0.2 M salt concentrations. Thus, the RNA component of box C/D complexes is the most significant contributor to site-specific methylation.</p></sec><sec><title>An asymmetric RNA exhibits wild-type specificity</title><p>It is well established that the site of methylation within box C/D targets is in part dictated by a spacing of five bases 3&#x02032; of either the D or the D&#x02032; boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). However, our data strongly suggests that a further contributor of specificity is tethering of the RNA to the box C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motif. The proposed Nop5p dimer could potentially span the distance between the two L7Ae/kink turn complexes creating a bowed structure that positions the appropriate 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl against the fibrillarin active site, locking the target/guide duplex into place for methylation, compensating for the relatively weak affinity of fibrillarin for dsRNA. This line of thought lead to the hypothesis that two box C/D motifs are required to achieve specificity but not two guide sequences. To test this, an RNA was designed with two box C/D motifs but only one targeting sequence (2B1T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) and assayed for site-specific methylation when complexed with Nop5p under physiological salt concentrations. Like the full RNA construct, this RNA contained a canonical two stem K-turn motif at the box C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; position. These experiments yield a specificity profile virtually identical to the wild-type box C/D complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, expt. G), reinforcing the idea that the box C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motif is contributing to the specificity of a C/D positioned target through protein&#x02013;RNA interactions. Interestingly, complexes set up with the 2B1T RNA and mNop5p exhibited a lack of specificity similar to that seen for the hemi-complex (data not shown) demonstrating a context-dependent effect on specificity with coiled-coil domain removal. As a further test, an RNA containing only one box C/D motif but two guide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) was constructed in which the two targeting sequences were joined by a five uracil linker in place of the C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motif. This one box C/D two target RNA (1B2T) was active under physiological conditions with full Nop5p. However, while the activity of this complex when used with target RNA with the fifth position hydroxyl removed was significantly down from wild-type target, there was still a significant amount of activity, similar to what was seen in the highly non-specific hemi-complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, expt. H). Also, removal of hydroxyls at neighboring positions resulted in a clear drop in activity yet none of the targets were seen to completely abolish activity. This implies that the 1B2T RNA is not capable of site-specifically methylating RNA targets. Thus, both box C/D motifs are required for the archaeal sRNP to achieve full specificity but only one guide sequence.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The structural requirements for specificity and activity in box C/D sno/sRNPs have only been partially defined. To date, the primary determinant for site-specific methylation that has been revealed is a strict adherence to the N + 5 rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). This rule states that 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl methylation occurs within the target RNA strand at the nucleotide paired to the guide sequence 5 nt 5&#x02032; of either the D or D&#x02032; box. This implies that specificity occurs through a ruler-like mechanism in which fibrillarin is correctly positioned over the site of methylation through association with proteins (L7Ae and Nop5p), which bind to the box C/D or C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motifs in a highly specific manner. However, given the complex architecture of this RNP enzyme, there are likely other structural requirements that confer site-specificity to fibrillarin, which is inherently non-specific.</p><p>Related to this issue is the symmetric nature of archaeal box C/D complexes that has been shown to be important for activity for reasons that remain unclear. An asymmetric complex composed of a single box C/D motif, L7Ae, Nop5p and fibrillarin could conceivably carry out site-specific methylation, however, previous work demonstrated a functional requirement for symmetry in box C/D complexes with partially asymmetric complexes exhibiting dramatically reduced activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). In these studies, we demonstrate that the bipartite architecture of the box C/D sRNP is essential for site-specific methylation, accounting for the absolutely conserved pseudo-symmetric architecture in naturally occurring complexes, but not for intrinsic methylation activity. Specifically, we demonstrate that both the box C/D and box C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motifs are required for pinpoint specificity.</p><p>The relationship between architectural symmetry, activity and the specificity of a model box C/D sRNP derived from <italic>P</italic>.<italic>horikoshii</italic> was explored through a reductive approach in which the box C/D sRNP was systematically disassembled from a symmetric complex to a fully asymmetric one. This approach revealed the relative importance of structural components in the context of both reduced and otherwise wild-type complexes. Strikingly, the fully reduced complex (hemi-RNP) displays most of the same features and activity of the wild-type complex including its ability to assemble into tight, well-defined intermediary complexes exhibiting binding affinities in accord with those observed for fully functional structurally intact box C/D complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Additionally, contrary to previous observations, the completely asymmetric hemi-complex was found to be quite active, exhibiting a temperature dependent activity profile identical to what has been observed with wild-type box C/D complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). However, removal of the coiled-coil domain of Nop5p introduced a strong salt requirement for activity, with methylation being restored only under high salt concentrations. Thus, while it has been proposed that the coiled-coil domain of Nop5p enables cross talk between the two active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), we have demonstrated that this is not required for activity. Aside from the salt requirement, the inability of other studies to detect significant levels of methyl incorporation with asymmetric complexes may also have been due to the use of insufficient SAM concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). A SAM titration with a wild-type box C/D complex revealed an optimal SAM concentration well above the amount used in previous studies and more aligned with physiological SAM concentrations of 20&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>).</p><p>The key difference between the wild-type RNP and the hemi-complex is that the latter exhibits a complete loss of specificity. This loss is not due to removal of the coiled-coil domain since hemi-RNA assembled with full Nop5p under both low and high salt concentrations is largely unable to site specifically methylate their target RNAs. Instead, a significant increase in specificity occurs in complexes with the full RNA regardless of the use of mNop5p, full Nop5p, high or low salt concentrations. These data demonstrate the importance of RNA structure distal to the methyl-directing C/D motif, further supported by using an RNA with a single box C/D motif but containing two guide sequences joined by a poly(U) linker in place of the C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motif. When incorporated into full Nop5p complexes under low salt conditions, this RNA was fully non-specific, mimicking the properties of the hemi-RNA. On the other hand, an RNA containing a single guide sequence but possessing both C/D and C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motifs was able to direct methylation with wild-type specificity. Therefore, the simple addition of a second box C/D motif to the hemi-RNA construct took us from a completely nonspecific complex to a highly specific methyltransferase. This asymmetric RNA reveals much about the requirement for bipartite structure (C/D and C&#x02032;/D&#x02032; motifs) in the highly specific box C/D sRNPs and reflects the ability of eukaryotic box C/D RNAs with only one functional guide sequence to function as single site enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The crystal structure of the Nop5p/fibrillarin tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) revealed that the fibrillarin active sites appear to be too far apart for simultaneous methylation at both targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Our results suggest that only one active site might be productively used at a time in the wild-type complex, consistent with observations made by Maxwell and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>A comparison of residues within the coiled-coil domain region between <italic>A.fulgidus</italic> and representative eukaryotes is highly suggestive of a eukaryotic Nop56p/Nop58p dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) although the interaction is speculative with recent work showing that Nop56p/Nop58p self-dimerization and the interaction of Nop56p/Nop58p with fibrillarin are mutually exclusive protein&#x02013;protein interactions in <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Our work demonstrates that dimerization of Nop5p in full RNA complexes is not necessary for specificity or activity. However, Nop5p dimerization through the coiled-coil domain was shown to be important for specificity in the context of the 2B1T RNA suggesting that the wild-type box C/D sRNA structure can overcome the need for the proposed dimerization of Nop5p but that this dimerization may still be important in more structurally deviant single guide snoRNA&#x02013;sRNA complexes similar to the 2B1T RNA. It is tempting to speculate that an insertion sequence of &#x0223c;60 amino acids between the two alpha helices of the Nop5p coiled-coil serves to anchor this protein to the second box C/D element through protein&#x02013;protein or protein&#x02013;RNA interactions that might be especially critical in the 2B1T RNA lacking the second guide sequence.</p><p>The coiled coil domain of Nop5p undoubtedly contributes to proper guide/target duplex positioning for pinpoint specificity; this role is supported by previous work as well as the data presented here. However, it also clear that the sRNA plays a dominant role in organizing the RNP and directing fibrillarin to the correct site of methylation. A recent study by Omer and coworkers in which the box C/D RNA of <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> was extensively probed using site-directed mutagenesis and tested for methylation activity supports this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Taken together our data reinforces the importance of the bipartite structure seen in archaeal and eukaryal box C/D complexes whose primary function is to deliver a specific 2&#x02032;-hydroxyl group to an active site that is potentially capable of recognizing any dsRNA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Jeffrey Kieft, Johnny Croy, Sunny Gilbert, Rebecca Montange and Colby Stoddard for critically reading this manuscript and the members of the Batey laboratory for critical discussions.

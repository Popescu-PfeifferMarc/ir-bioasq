This ACS is recognized by the replication initiator, the origin recognition complex (ORC). However, not every match to the ACS constitutes a replication origin. Here, we investigated the requirements for ORC binding to origins that carry multiple, redundant ACSs, such as <italic>ARS603</italic>. Previous studies raised the possibility that these ACSs function as individual ORC binding sites. Detailed mutational analysis of the two ACSs in <italic>ARS603</italic> revealed that they function in concert and give rise to an initiation pattern compatible with a single bipartite ORC binding site. Consistent with this notion, deletion of one base pair between the ACS matches abolished ORC binding at <italic>ARS603</italic>. Importantly, loss of ORC binding <italic>in vitro</italic> correlated with the loss of ARS activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results argue that replication origins in yeast are in general comprised of bipartite ORC binding sites that cannot function in random alignment but must conform to a configuration that permits ORC binding. These requirements help to explain why only a limited number of ACS matches in the yeast genome qualify as ORC binding sites.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although the mechanism underlying the initiation of DNA synthesis differs across species, a general theme has emerged to describe the activation of the replication process in prokaryotes, animal viruses and simple eukaryotes. The recognition of a binding site with multiple sequence elements is a key factor for the initiation of DNA replication in a number of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). For many of these sites, the spacing between sequence elements is crucial for the binding of the replication initiator and the subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). It has been shown, for instance, that exact spacing of the bipartite initiator binding site is necessary for replication from <italic>oriP</italic> in Epstein-Barr virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and the simian virus (SV) 40 origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The situation in eukaryotic cells is less well defined, as replication initiates from multiple start sites distributed along chromosomes and the search for origin sequences, especially in the genomes of mammalian cells, has proven difficult, with only a few well-studied examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> remains the eukaryotic system in which replication origins are best understood. Origin sequences were first identified as autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) by their ability to promote replication of plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). ARSs carry multiple matches to an AT-rich, 11 bp ARS consensus sequence (ACS), 5&#x02032;-(A/T) TTTA(C/T)(A/G)TTT(A/T)-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Substitution mutations scanning origin regions with matches to the ACS have identified multiple functional elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Elements that are essential for replication are called A elements, while those that are non-essential are referred to as B elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In <italic>ARS1</italic>, A and B elements overlap with matches to the ACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and at least one B element in conjunction with the A element is required to form a functional origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Other ARS sequences, including <italic>ARS305</italic> and <italic>ARS307</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), contain similar clusters of a single, essential A element and multiple B elements, all of which are associated with an ACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). What has remained a conundrum is the fact that there are more than 10 000 matches to the ACS in the budding yeast genome, but only a small subset of these appear to be functional binding sites for the initiator, the origin recognition complex (ORC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In an attempt to distinguish functional ACSs from non-functional ones, an extended ACS that comprises 17 bp, instead of 11, has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). However, the predictive value of this 17 bp sequence has not been firmly established, and it seems that algorithms based on the 17 bp consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) have a limited capacity for correctly predicting all 430 potential origins in the yeast genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>Footprinting analyses have shown that ORC interacts directly with the ACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In contrast to origins such as <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ARS307</italic>, which carry a single essential A element, a second class of origins, branded compound origins, has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). These consist of multiple ACS matches that appear to serve as redundant ORC binding sites because the origin was still active when one ACS was mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The best-studied examples for this class are <italic>ARS101</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and <italic>ARS310</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Similarly, <italic>ARS603</italic> is also comprised of two ACSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). We have designated the ACS matches in <italic>ARS101</italic> and <italic>ARS603</italic> as A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>); however, it is important to point out that they are not directly equivalent to the A elements in <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ARS307</italic>, which are necessary for ORC binding but not sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Substitution mutations at either ACS in <italic>ARS603</italic> do not abolish origin activity, but combined mutations in both ACSs result in complete loss of replication function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Thus, <italic>ARS603</italic> has been proposed to function as a compound origin with multiple individual ORC binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>One prediction for compound origins is that they possess multiple, redundant replication start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Previous mapping studies of <italic>ARS1</italic> revealed a single, defined leading strand start site that maps adjacent to the ORC binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). For origins with redundant, non-essential ACSs, it is therefore possible that more than one start site for replication exists. However, this has never been directly addressed.</p><p>To examine the origin structure of an ARS element containing more than one potential ORC binding site, we investigated replication initiation at the origin <italic>ARS603</italic>. Our studies revealed that replication initiates in close proximity to the ACS matches where ORC binding occurs. The initiation pattern of <italic>ARS603</italic> is similar to that of <italic>ARS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), suggesting that the two ACSs at <italic>ARS603</italic> do not function as individual origins. Because it was previously unknown if a single or multiple ORC complexes occupy the ACSs in compound origins, we employed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to distinguish between these possibilities. Our results demonstrate that the two ACSs act in concert as a single bipartite ORC binding site and that their spacing and orientation affect ORC binding <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. While substitution mutations similar to those introduced in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) retained some ORC binding activity, deletion of one ACS abrogated ORC binding. These studies argue that a single ACS is insufficient to define a functional ORC binding site, and we propose the inclusion of bipartite consensus sequences in future algorithms for the identification of replication origins in yeast. The dependence of ORC binding on the spacing of specific recognition sequences identifies another link between origin structure and activation to further our understanding of the DNA replication initiation process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Replication initiation point mapping</title><p>Replication initiation point (RIP) mapping was performed on the strain SP1 <italic>MAT</italic><bold><italic>a</italic></bold>, <italic>ura3-52 his3 trp1-289 leu2-2</italic>,<italic>113 ade8 can1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).

Annealed oligonucleotides spanning wild-type (WT) or mutant origin sequences of <italic>ARS603</italic>, <italic>ARS101</italic>, <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ARS307</italic> were inserted into this vector.

Binding reactions with 10 fM of labeled probe and 10 nM baculovirus-purified yeast ORC, a generous gift from Dr B.

Chromatin samples were obtained from asynchronously growing cultures and processed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). ORC-bound fragments were precipitated from pre-cleared chromatin with a mouse, anti-yeast ORC2 monoclonal antibody (RDI) and protein A sepharose beads (Sigma), which were pre-blocked in BSA.

Yeast transformations into the SP1 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) were performed with lithium acetate, and cells were plated onto SC&#x02013;Ura plates.

Yeast cells containing the pARS plasmid with the given origin sequence were grown in SC&#x02013;Ura medium to early log phase, counted by hemocytometer and plated to assess the initial number of plasmid-containing cells. Approximately 200 cells were released into 2 ml of complete medium for 30 h at 30&#x000b0;C. Cells were counted again, and equal amounts were plated on complete and SC&#x02013;Ura medium to determine the percent of colonies that retained the pARS plasmid.

To determine the DNA replication initiation pattern for <italic>ARS603</italic>, we performed RIP mapping. This method allowed us to map the start sites for both leading and lagging strand synthesis with nucleotide resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). <italic>ARS603</italic> has two core elements, a 10/11 and a 9/11 match to the ACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Here we refer to the first ACS match as A<sub>1</sub> and the second ACS match as A<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are oriented in opposite directions, separated by 5 bp. For RIP mapping, DNA was isolated by CsCl gradient centrifugation from asynchronously growing cultures. Nocodazole-arrested cells served as the source for the non-replicating DNA control sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Nascent DNA was enriched by treatment with &#x003bb;-exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Nascent or non-replicating DNA was used as templates for primer extension reactions using radiolabeled primers that annealed &#x0223c;250 bp up or downstream of the ACSs. Primer extension products were fractionated on polyacrylamide gels next to corresponding sequencing reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). The ladder of bands represents replication intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) and the position of the smallest band marks the initiation site for the leading strand [also referred to as the transition point (TP) between leading and lagging strands, TP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>]. All other bands represent initiation sites for Okazaki fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Any faint bands that were not reproducible were not considered. We mapped the TP between leading and lagging strand synthesis within the A<sub>2</sub> element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Replication initiated at nucleotide position 403 on the top strand and at nucleotide position 394 on the bottom strand, 9 bp apart. Subsequent Okazaki fragment start sites for lagging strand synthesis were spaced at intervals of &#x0223c;50&#x02013;60 bp or multiples thereof. DNA from nocadozole-arrested cells did not show any reproducible bands, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, lane N). Positive controls for correct primer annealing were performed on restriction enzyme-digested DNA, where the restriction site was confirmed by RIP mapping (data not shown). A synopsis of the initiation map of <italic>ARS603</italic> is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is worthwhile to note that we did not observe a composite pattern (an overlay of two initiation maps with one replication start site in A<sub>1</sub> and another one in A<sub>2</sub>), as might have been predicted for a compound origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, lane D). These results suggest that DNA replication at <italic>ARS603</italic> likely initiates from a single start site, similarly to <italic>ARS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Each ACS match at <italic>ARS603</italic> contributes equally to ORC binding</title><p>Based on our RIP mapping results and earlier studies on <italic>ARS603</italic> by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), we predicted that ORC binds to A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>. Because this had never been tested directly, and it was unclear whether A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> could bind a single ORC or multiple complexes, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift analyses on <italic>ARS603</italic> using purified ORC. Initially, we titrated ORC to approximate binding of 50% of a &#x0223c;90 bp probe (data not shown) and used these conditions for subsequent experiments (see Materials and Methods for details). ORC binding to <italic>ARS603</italic> was dependent on the presence of ATP (data not shown), as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>Previous analyses of <italic>ARS603</italic> used XhoI substitution mutations that converted the A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> sequences into 7/11 matches to the ACS. Either mutation at A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> alone did not affect origin activity; only the combined mutation of both elements resulted in complete loss of activity at <italic>ARS603</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Using these exact substitutions, here labeled S4, we found that mutations at A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> caused a decrease in ORC binding in comparison to ORC binding at the WT <italic>ARS603</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, the combined mutation of both A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> resulted in the dramatic reduction of ORC binding, consistent with the reported loss of origin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). These results suggested that ORC binding is indeed affected by mutations in A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Since the XhoI substitution mutations resulted in a gain of GC content, we tested a variety of base substitutions that deviated from the ACS, but kept the GC content of A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> the same. Not surprisingly, the increase in mismatches to the ACS correlated with the decrease in the amount of shifted probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as expected from prior findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, however, these 7/11 matches retained much less ORC binding capacity than the 7/11 matches in the S4 A<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and S4 A<sub>1</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> probes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The decrease in binding activity may have been a result of mutating the highly conserved position 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) within the ACS of A<sub>1</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and A<sub>2b</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> probes. In contrast, the S4 mutations retain a stretch of Ts in positions 8&#x02013;10, leaving the most highly conserved nucleotides intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). To further disrupt each A element in <italic>ARS603</italic>, we utilized substitution mutations with the linker sequence (5&#x02032;-CCTCGAGG-3&#x02032;). These linker sequences replaced 8 bp of sequence and were used in earlier studies to dissect <italic>ARS1</italic>, <italic>ARS307</italic> and <italic>ARS305</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). We called these mutations S6 because they replaced 6 bp of the ACS, reducing the match at these elements to 5/11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The ability of ORC to retard the electrophoretic mobility of the <italic>ARS603</italic> fragment was severely decreased for both S6 fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes A<sub>1</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and A<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>). In contrast to the S4 probes, ORC binding was reduced by &#x0003e;50% for individual S6 probes [similar to the A<sub>1</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and A<sub>2b</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>)]. Equivalent mutations in A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> resulted in similar reduction of ORC binding, suggesting that the individual ACSs play an equal role in ORC binding at <italic>ARS603</italic>. These results suggested to us that A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> contribute synergistically to ORC binding, either as two individual but cooperative ORC binding sites or as a single ORC binding site.</p></sec><sec><title>A single ACS match is insufficient to support ORC binding</title><p>Although both ACSs in <italic>ARS603</italic> appeared to contribute equally to ORC binding, we never detected a second band, even at very high concentrations of ORC (50 nM/reaction, data not shown), as would have been expected if two ORCs could bind to the WT probe. To further define the roles of A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>, we constructed fragments of the same length as the WT <italic>ARS603</italic> fragment, containing either element A<sub>1</sub> or element A<sub>2</sub> flanked by random sequences that were unable to bind ORC by themselves (data not shown). Subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays revealed no significant binding of ORC to either A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The consequences of deleting A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> contrasted with the effect of substitution mutations that still allowed for ORC binding as long as one ACS remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), explaining earlier reports on the origin activity of <italic>ARS603</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). In addition, we used unlabeled A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> containing fragments as well as a WT control in a competition assay measuring ORC binding to a labeled WT <italic>ARS603</italic> fragment. Consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, 50- and 500-fold excess of A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> sequences did not impede ORC binding to WT <italic>ARS603</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These data support the notion that both A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are required for ORC binding to <italic>ARS603</italic> and cannot function as individual ORC binding sites.</p></sec><sec><title>ORC binding at <italic>ARS603</italic> requires a defined helical phase</title><p>Examination of the <italic>ARS603</italic> sequence revealed that A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are separated by 5 bp. Because A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> lie on opposite strands, this particular spacing would place the two elements on the same side of the DNA double helix. To explore whether this specific configuration is a requirement for ORC binding, we inserted sequences of different lengths between the A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> elements. The insertion of 5 bp, approximately half a helical turn, caused a severe reduction in ORC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, insertion of an additional 5 bp for a total of 10 bp, or close to a full helical turn, partially restored ORC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Based on these results, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> require alignment to a defined helical phase to function as an efficient ORC recognition sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>A single base pair deletion between the ACS matches in <italic>ARS603</italic> and <italic>ARS101</italic> abolishes ORC binding</title><p>Replication initiation at a number of viral origins is severely influenced by the spacing between recognition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Because the configuration of functional elements and associated ACSs varies from one origin to another in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), it is widely assumed that the distance between ACSs is not relevant for origin function. To test this hypothesis directly, we examined the effect of a single bp deletion between A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>. Surprisingly, ORC no longer bound to the <italic>ARS603</italic> fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The effect of the single bp deletion, which removed an A-T bp, was attributed to change in spacing rather than the requirement for that particular bp or a change in G-C content, because the substitution of the same A-T bp with a C-G bp produced no discernable change in ORC binding (data not shown). Thus, the severity in the loss of ORC binding upon deletion of 1 bp contrasted strongly with the number of substitution mutations within the ACS matches required to achieve the same effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To determine whether the effect of a single bp deletion was specific to <italic>ARS603</italic> or could be generalized to other origins, we chose <italic>ARS101</italic> to perform a similar experiment. This origin also possesses two ACS matches, one of which (A<sub>2</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) has been reported to support replication individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). A single bp deletion between the two ACSs, originally 8 bp apart, severely compromised ORC binding at <italic>ARS101</italic>, even though we added twice as much ORC to these binding reactions as we used for our experiments with <italic>ARS603</italic> fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We concluded that the spacing between the A elements in <italic>ARS603</italic> and <italic>ARS101</italic> is crucial for ORC binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Spacing of bipartite elements at <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ARS307</italic> does not affect ORC binding</title><p>The ACS matches in both <italic>ARS603</italic> and <italic>ARS101</italic> were reported to be redundant with respect to their ability to bind ORC or confer ARS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). In contrast to these compound origins, <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ARS307</italic> contain only a single essential ACS match (the A element). Previous studies showed that the A element is required but not sufficient for ORC binding and that ORC interacts with both the A and B1 elements in <italic>ARS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). To address whether the spacing between A and B1 is crucial for ORC binding at <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ARS307</italic>, we introduced deletion mutations between these elements. These deletions also reduced the spacing between the associated ACSs. ORC binding at both <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ARS307</italic> was not significantly affected by the removal of a single bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and E</xref>). Furthermore, no effect was seen at <italic>ARS1</italic> regardless of the removal of either a C-G or a T-A bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Indeed, the deletion of even two out of the 4 bp between the ACSs at <italic>ARS1</italic> was not sufficient to significantly impair ORC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In <italic>ARS307</italic>, the distance between the two ACSs is rather large, spanning 26 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, we also tested whether the removal of 5 bp had any effect on ORC binding. However, we did not detect any changes (data not shown). Therefore, at <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ARS307</italic>, small changes in spacing between the ACSs (and thus between the A and B1 elements) do not appear to be critical for ORC binding, supporting prior ARS assay results on <italic>ARS1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). This is also consistent with earlier reports suggesting that the A element at <italic>ARS1</italic> can cooperate with any of the non-essential B elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Orientation of the A elements affects ORC binding at <italic>ARS603</italic>, <italic>ARS101</italic> and <italic>ARS1</italic></title><p>Early comparisons of ARS element configurations revealed that the orientation of ACSs differs from origin to origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). This prompted us to investigate whether ORC binding was sensitive to changes in the orientation of individual ACSs at <italic>ARS603</italic>, <italic>ARS101</italic> and <italic>ARS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Previous analyses have noted a favored ACS orientation in some instances for the support of plasmid replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). At <italic>ARS603</italic>, the reversal of either A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> resulted in a significant reduction of ORC binding (&#x0003e;50%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The reversal of either ACS match at <italic>ARS101</italic> resulted in a complete loss of ORC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Meanwhile, at <italic>ARS1</italic>, the reversal of the ACS within the essential A element caused a severe reduction in ORC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane revA), similar to a linker substitution mutation in the A element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane link A<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). However, a change in the orientation of either the ACS that is associated with the B1 element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lane revB) or the reversal of the entire B1 element (data not shown) reduced ORC binding only slightly. According to these results, ORC binding is sensitive to the orientation of the ACS within the respective A elements of all tested origins. This further supports the notion that a single ACS cannot function as an ORC binding site but acts in concert with its flanking region.</p></sec><sec><title>ORC binding <italic>in vivo</italic> reflects ORC binding <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Because the <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA mobility shift assays using purified ORC revealed that the spacing between A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> was critical for ORC binding at <italic>ARS603</italic>, we next examined the effect of the single bp deletion <italic>in vivo</italic> by ChIP using ORC2-specific antibodies.

The non-origin region R11 was included as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). Thus, the ability of ORC to bind <italic>ARS603 in vitro</italic> accurately reflected its behavior <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Origin activation parallels ORC binding</title><p>So far, we have shown that substitutions within the ACS as well as changes in orientation and spacing between A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> severely affected ORC binding at <italic>ARS603</italic>. To test whether these mutations also affected origin activation, we performed plasmid stability assays. These assays require origin sequences to be cloned into plasmids containing the <italic>URA3</italic> gene and a centromere sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Once transformed into yeast, the plasmid constructs are stably retained only with the presence of an active and effective yeast origin. Mitotic stability indicates the ability of the origin to support DNA replication initiation and retain the plasmid, thus allowing for survival in selective medium.</p><p>Sequences of &#x0223c;200 bp covering the entire <italic>ARS603</italic> region were used to test origin activity. WT <italic>ARS1</italic> served as a positive control, and <italic>ARS1</italic>/A<sup>&#x02212;</sup> served as a negative control. The pARS1/A<sup>&#x02212;</sup> construct did not produce viable transformants that could be restreaked onto selective medium, as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The level of origin activity <italic>in vivo</italic> correlated well with ORC binding <italic>in vitro</italic> in all cases examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). While WT <italic>ARS603</italic> had a mitotic stability similar to that of <italic>ARS1</italic>, the double substitution mutants for A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> at <italic>ARS603</italic> were unable to grow on selective medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Notably, the deletion of a single base pair or the insertion of a half helical turn also produced only microcolony transformants that were unable to be passaged onto selective medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). We obtained similar results when we deleted a single base pair between the two ACSs in <italic>ARS101</italic> (data not shown). Consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> ORC binding studies, the insertion of a full helical turn between the A elements partially rescued growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The 38 bp core region of <italic>ARS603</italic> containing WT A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>, which was capable of supporting ORC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, WT) also produced transformants that could be restreaked onto selective medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, A<sub>1</sub>+A<sub>2</sub>). At the same time, fragments of the same length containing only either A<sub>1</sub> or A<sub>2</sub> of <italic>ARS603</italic> were unable to grow on selective medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), as expected from their inability to bind ORC <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Thus, in all cases examined, loss of ORC binding corresponded well with loss of origin activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Analysis of <italic>ARS603</italic> provides a new perspective on the contribution of both DNA sequence and structure to origin function. Because no two origins of DNA replication are identical, it has been difficult to understand what distinguishes functional from non-functional ACSs. Examination of the structural framework necessary for ORC binding in budding yeast provides clues to the complex nature of its interaction with DNA. In this study, we demonstrate that while two ACSs at <italic>ARS603</italic> contribute equally to ORC binding, they cannot function independently. The ACSs at <italic>ARS603</italic> require a restricted alignment to form a functional ORC binding site, and it is reasonable to assume that this may apply to other loci besides <italic>ARS603</italic> in the yeast genome.</p><sec><title>Two classes of origins in budding yeast</title><p>In the course of defining the parameters that allow for the efficient binding of ORC to <italic>ARS603</italic>, we discovered that the interdomain spacing between A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> is critically important. This phenomenon was not found to be unique to <italic>ARS603</italic> since binding of ORC to <italic>ARS101</italic> was also responsive to single bp interdomain deletions. At the same time, not all of the origins we tested were affected by such changes, as <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ARS307</italic> did not show any significant loss of ORC binding. Therefore, we propose that two classes of origins exist in yeast: those that require exact interdomain spacing and those that are tolerant of spacing manipulation. These differences directly reflect two different modes of ORC binding. In <italic>ARS603</italic>, the two ACSs that constitute the bipartite ORC binding site appear to contribute equally to ORC binding, whereas the A element in <italic>ARS1</italic> appears to be the predominant site of ORC interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Furthermore, it is possible that other ORC-interacting proteins modulate the affinity of ORC for certain sites in the genome. Indeed, previous studies have found that another replication initiation protein, Cdc6, regulates the sequence-specific binding of ORC at <italic>ARS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). It will be interesting to see whether Cdc6-dependent regulation is characteristic for this class of origins or also applies to <italic>ARS603</italic> and <italic>ARS101</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>ORC binding at bipartite sites</title><p>Previous studies suggested that ORC could bind to a bipartite site comprised of A and B1 elements (<italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>307</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). However, prior evaluations of origin function also described the discovery of origins with multiple ACSs with redundant function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). These origins were named compound if they contained redundant ACSs that were proposed to function as individual ORC binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Our study on <italic>ARS603</italic> reconciles these two origin models.</p><p>Although <italic>ARS603</italic> contains two ACSs (A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>), we concluded from our results that these two elements are not acting as binding sites for separate ORCs but rather as a bipartite binding site for a single initiator complex. This may also apply to <italic>ARS101</italic> because the deletion of a single bp between the ACSs, as well as changes in their orientation, abolished ORC binding <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, <italic>ARS101</italic> activity was markedly reduced when one ACS was mutated, arguing that ORC strongly prefers to bind to both ACSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). At first glance, our results seem to contradict the finding by Theis and Newlon that the 10/11 match in <italic>ARS101</italic> can retain ARS activity by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). However, further inspection of the <italic>ARS101</italic> sequence reveals two additional 8/11 matches downstream of the 10/11 ACS element (data not shown). It is conceivable that one of these 8/11 matches cooperated with the 10/11 match to form a bipartite ORC binding site. Consistent with this notion, we show that a single A element in <italic>ARS603</italic>, another compound origin, cannot sustain ORC binding. These data are in agreement with early reports that the 11 bp ACS is necessary but not sufficient for ARS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). This is further supported by the fact that substitution mutations at <italic>ARS101</italic> showed the gain of new hypersensitive sites with the loss of one ACS element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), indicating that ORC contacted a second site in close proximity to the remaining A element.</p><p>At <italic>ARS1</italic> as well, footprinting studies showed that mutation of the A element resulted in protection over a 9/11 ACS at an additional B element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), consistent with the recovery of a bipartite site. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies determined that two ORCs cannot bind to two inverted ACSs at <italic>ARS1</italic> simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), and other studies have determined that the stoichiometry of ORC to the <italic>ARS1</italic> origin is 1:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). It follows that the recognition of a bipartite binding site with two ACSs by a single ORC likely applies to the vast majority of origins in the yeast genome.</p><p>In addition, fluorescence anisotropy studies showed that ORC is capable of binding to ACS matches associated with various elements of <italic>ARS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>); however, only with the presence of the A element was ORC binding dependent on ATP, a key factor in the sequence-specific recognition of ORC at origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Therefore, it seems likely that certain ORC conformations dictated by the spatial arrangements of ACSs may either allow or restrict ATP-hydrolysis by ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). It is conceivable that the single bp deletion between A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> in <italic>ARS603</italic>, or the reversal of A elements in <italic>ARS1</italic>, <italic>ARS101</italic> and <italic>ARS603</italic>, induced an ORC conformation that failed to repress ATP-hydrolysis by ORC and did not facilitate stable binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>).</p><p>As a heteromultimer protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), ORC subunits possess the potential to make contact at an origin in a variety of ways. Modification-interference and missing-contact assays at <italic>ARS1</italic> and <italic>ARS305</italic> provided the first look at the diverse nature of the ORC-origin interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). While ORC contacts in <italic>ARS305</italic> were discerned within a &#x0223c;50 bp region, ORC coverage at <italic>ARS1</italic> extended to a &#x0223c;92 bp range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Footprinting and mobility shift studies also support the ability of DNA sequences to wrap around ORC, enabling it to contact multiple regions at wide ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Thus, it is possible for ORC to make contact with sequences over a long distance. However, ORC may possess limited adaptability, resulting in the selection of certain bipartite sites and providing one explanation for why the yeast genome harbors only &#x0223c;430 ORC binding sites, but has more than 10&#x02009;000 ACS matches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>In a recent model for the prediction of functional origins in budding yeast, Breier <italic>et al</italic>. devised an Oriscan algorithm based on the alignment of a subset of known origins to the extended 17 bp ACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). This algorithm was based on the assumption that a single extended ACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) in conjunction with certain flanking regions could function as an ORC binding site and did not fully take into account the bipartite structure of replication origins in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). We propose a revised algorithm definition to include two matches to the ACS as a bipartite binding site for ORC, as previous studies have also shown that synthetic constructs with two copies of the ACS are sufficient for ARS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Moreover, it is known that the presence of additional ACSs further improve origin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). This definition does not preclude the use of the extended 17 bp ACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>Prior analyses of the region between the A and B1 elements (and thus between the corresponding ACSs) of <italic>ARS1</italic> indicated that an insertion of 195 bp or greater essentially inactivated ARS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Inspection of nine origins on chromosome VI with identified, essential ACSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) revealed that a second ACS (with a 9/11 match or better) resides in close proximity, at a distance of at most 119 bp (data not shown). On average, we calculated the distance to be 38 &#x000b1; 35 bp (data not shown). We suggest that these considerations might provide a framework for the definition of a functional ORC binding site. Clearly, further studies are needed to test the validity of this hypothesis. Phylogenetic comparisons of conserved sequences may contribute to these endeavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Bipartite structures for origin recognition in other organisms</title><p>Our studies demonstrate that the spacing of the bipartite ORC binding site affects the origin activity of <italic>ARS603</italic>. Replication mechanisms in a number of prokaryotes and viruses show similarity to mechanisms employed at the eukaryotic origins of budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). In fact, the recognition of a bipartite binding site for the initiation of bi-directional replication is a familiar theme that is seen in bacterial and viral systems, such as at <italic>oriP</italic> of Epstein-Barr virus and the core origin of SV40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, ATP-dependent origin activation relies on the presence of two out of the multiple 9-mers that comprise <italic>oriC</italic>, consistent with the recognition of a bipartite site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Precise spacing of sequences at the dyad symmetry element DS within <italic>oriP</italic> is required for interaction with EBNA1 in Epstein-Barr virus where origin activity is abolished with the deletion of 1 to 2 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Likewise, spacing affects binding of the SV40 initiator, large T-antigen, at site II that requires a minimum of 10 bp between two pairs of pentanucleotides with inward orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). According to our results, the A elements at <italic>ARS603</italic> appear to function similarly with a requirement for defined spacing and helical phasing.</p><p>Some evidence exists to suggest the conservation of a bipartite site in other eukaryotes as well. For instance, footprinting analyses of a metazoan replication origin, ori II/9A, in <italic>Sciara coprophila</italic> using nuclear extract and purified ORC, show two separate regions of protection for ORC binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). Furthermore, recent ChIP studies at the human <italic>c-myc</italic> replicator suggest that ORC binds to two distinct AT-rich regions, resulting in a bipartite binding pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). Thus, the use of a bipartite binding site for the initiator appears to be another connection in the mechanism for the initiation of DNA replication in multiple organisms.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to B.

In this study, we show that the exportin-5 orthologues from different species such as human, fruit fly and yeast exhibit diverged functions. We found that Msn5p, a yeast exportin-5 orthologue, binds double-stranded RNAs and that it prefers a shorter 22 nt, double-stranded RNA to &#x0223c;80 nt pre-miRNA, even though both of these RNAs share a similar terminal structure. Furthermore, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> exportin-5 binds pre-miRNAs and that amongst the exportin-5 orthologues tested, it shows the highest affinity for tRNAs. The knockdown of <italic>Drosophila</italic> exportin-5 in cultured cells decreased the amounts of tRNA as well as miRNA, whereas the knock down of human exportin-5 in cultured cells affected only miRNA but not tRNA levels. These results indicate that double-stranded RNA binding ability is an inherited functional characteristic of the exportin-5 orthologues and that <italic>Drosophila</italic> exportin-5 functions as an exporter of tRNAs as well as pre-miRNAs in the fruit fly that lacks the orthologous gene for exportin-t.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Since the nucleus and the cytoplasm are physically separated compartments in eukaryotic cells, different classes of RNAs and proteins are transported into and out of the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex. Shuttling transporters are indispensable for the signal mediated nulceo-cytoplasmic transport of different cargoes. The importin-&#x003b2; family proteins comprise one major class of nucleo-cytoplasmic transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The importin-&#x003b2; family proteins are subdivided into two major classes, based on their directionality of transport i.e.; importins function in the nuclear import, whereas exportins are engaged in the nuclear export of various cargoes. The small nuclear GTPase Ran plays a pivotal role, in dictating the directionality of transport mediated by the importin-&#x003b2; family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>Exportin-5 (Exp5) has been identified as an exportin for various RNAs including viral mini-helix RNA and precursors of microRNA (pre-miRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). These non-coding RNAs share common structural characteristics, such as a small size, hairpin-like fold-back structures due to intramolecular base pairing, and a 2&#x02013;3 nt protrusion at their 3&#x02032; ends, which are also known as common structural features of RNase III-processed RNAs. Indeed, a recent report demonstrated that human (hs) Exp5 recognizes pre-microRNAs through their double-stranded (ds) stem and the short overhang at the 3&#x02032;-end that are produced by nuclear RNaseIII Drosha cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Msn5p, the budding yeast orthologue of mammalian Exp5, was originally identified as an exportin for a subset of proteins, not all but most of which are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Since there is no sequence similarity among these protein cargoes, proteinaceous nuclear export signal (NES) specific for Msn5p is still elusive. In addition to these cargoes, Msn5p may also function as an exportin for tRNAs, albeit it was only indirectly shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The exportin that was first assigned as being specific for tRNAs is Los1p in yeast and exportin-t (Exp-t) in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Although yeast strains lacking either <italic>LOS1</italic> or <italic>MSN5</italic> alone revealed only moderate defects in the nuclear export of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), the double knockout strain, lacking both of these genes, showed a significant defect in the nuclear export of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Using a <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte microinjection system, it was shown that both Exp-t and Exp5 of mammalian origin also promoted the nuclear export of tRNAs, although the potency of Exp-t was higher than that of Exp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>HsExp-t binds to the T&#x003c8;C and acceptor arms of tRNA under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Both Bohnsack <italic>et al</italic>. and Calado <italic>et al</italic>. have suggested that the mechanism of recognition of tRNAs by Exp5 are different from that by Exp-t, based on their observations that Exp5, but not Exp-t, is able to form a ternary complex with tRNA along with a tRNA binding protein, eEF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a defect in tRNA processing was observed in an Exp-t orthologue PAUSED (PSD) mutant, but not in an Exp5 orthologue HASTY (HST) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). As mentioned above, mammalian Exp5 facilitates the nuclear export of pre-miRNA and the viral mini helix RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), but other cargoes for Exp-t, except for tRNAs have not yet been identified. These cumulative findings suggest that in most organisms, including animals and plants, Exp5 orthologues may play major roles in pre-miRNA export, whereas it comprises a minor export route for tRNAs.</p><p>Interestingly, however, it was predicted that no Exp-t orthologous gene exists in several arthropods including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (dm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). To date, the issue of how tRNA export is achieved in such organisms remains unknown. In this study, we compared the functional characteristics of three Exp5 orthologues from different species to determine whether Exp5 orthologues from different organisms function in different manners. Although we found that all the Exp5 orthologues examined were able to bind both pre-miRNAs and tRNAs, there are significant differences in their substrate preferences. Yeast Msn5p exhibited a higher affinity for a short 22 bp dsRNA than to a &#x0223c;80 bp pre-miRNA with the hairpin-like fold-back structure. Though hsExp5 was able to recognize tRNAs as cargoes, the binding of hsExp5 to pre-miRNA was not inhibited by an excess amount of tRNA. In contrast, we found that tRNAs efficiently inhibited the interaction between dmExp5 and pre-miRNA. The RNAi-induced knockdown of the expression of dmExp5 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider's 2 cells caused a decrease in the expression of both tRNA and miRNA. The down regulation of hsExp5 in human cells, on the other hand, resulted in a decrease in miRNA but not tRNA. These results indicate that, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, dmExp5 plays a central role in the nuclear export of tRNA and miRNA and that dsRNA binding ability is an inherited functional property of the Exp5 orthologues. The latter indication suggests the intriguing possibility that dsRNA may be widely involved in the nuclear export of protein cargoes by yeast Msn5p.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>To construct a template for pT7-pre-miR-30, two oligonucleotides 5&#x02032;-GATCCTTTC<underline>TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG</underline>GCGACTGTAAACATCCTCGACTGGAAGCTGTGAAGCCACAGATGGGCTTTCAGTCGGATGTTTGCAGCTGCTGCATG -3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CAGCAGCTGCAAACATCCGACTGAAAGCCCATCTGTGGCTTCACAGCTTCCAGTCGAGGATGTTTACAGTCGCCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGAAAG-3&#x02032; (underline indicates the T7 promoter sequence) were annealed and ligated to the pUC18 vector that had been treated with BamHI and SphI.

Therefore, the binding of bacterially expressed hsExp5, dmExp5 and Msn5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to pre-miRNA was first examined by an electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA), in which <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed radio-labeled human pre-miR-30 was used as a probe. The labeled pre-miR-30 probe was efficiently exported from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte nuclei (data not shown), indicating that this probe is functional. Since exportins require Ran-GTP for forming a stable complex with their cargoes, purified RanQ69L-GTP and its orthologous mutants from cognate species, which are deficient in GTP hydrolysis, were added exogenously. We observed that hsExp5 and dmExp5 efficiently bound pre-miR-30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, hsExp5: lanes 1&#x02013;5; dmExp5: lanes 6&#x02013;10), whereas Msn5p exhibited only weak, but still significant binding to pre-miR-30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 11&#x02013;15). The binding of the Exp5 orthologues to pre-miRNA was specific, since it was Ran-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 1, 15 and 29) and no interaction between pre-miR-30 and CAS or Exp1, which are exportins for importin-&#x003b1; or leucine-rich NES-containing proteins, was detected irrespective of the presence of Ran-GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 16&#x02013;19).</p><p>To further examine the specificity of the interactions between the Exp5 orthologues and pre-miRNA observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, competition experiments were performed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> indicates that unlabeled pre-miR-30 competed with labeled pre-miR-30 for binding to dmExp5 in a dose-dependent manner and as efficiently as that of hsExp5 (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for quantitative data). From these data, we conclude that both hsExp5 and dmExp5 bind pre-miR-30 with similar efficiency.</p><p>On the other hand, as expected from the result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, unlabeled pre-miR-30 was a weak competitor for the binding of Msn5p to pre-miR-30. In contrast, we found that the interactions of all of the Exp5 orthologues to pre-miR-30 were efficiently inhibited by a 22 bp double-stranded (ds) RNA with a 2 nt overhang at the 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 11&#x02013;14, 25&#x02013;28 and 39&#x02013;40), but not by a dsDNA encoding the same sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;10, 21&#x02013;24 and 35&#x02013;38). Interestingly, the binding of Msn5p to pre-miR-30, but not those of hsExp5 and dmExp5, was more efficiently competed with the shorter 22 bp dsRNA than with the miRNA precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare lanes 30&#x02013;34 with lanes 39&#x02013;42). To determine whether Msn5p recognizes the terminal structure of the dsRNA as a binding site, the inhibitory activity of another dsRNA that had the same sequence at double-stranded region with a 2 nt overhang at the 5&#x02032; end was tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, bottom). The interaction between pre-miR-30 and hsExp5 or Msn5p was competed by the dsRNA with 3&#x02032; overhang, but not by that with 5&#x02032; overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, top). These results indicate that Msn5p specifically recognizes the terminal structure of the short dsRNA as reported for mammalian Exp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the RNA binding activities of the Exp5 orthologues are evolutionary conserved from humans to budding yeast, but that there are significant differences in their substrate preferences.</p></sec><sec><title>dmExp5 binds tRNAs more strongly than does hsExp5</title><p>We next attempted to confirm the binding between labeled pre-miR-30 and Exp5 using <italic>in vitro</italic> translated proteins by a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> right panel, lane 2, a retard band containing hsExp5 and pre-miR-30 was clearly observed. However, we found that <italic>in vitro</italic> translated dmExp5 did not bind pre-miR-30 under the same binding conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel, lane 4). The same result was obtained when the bacterially expressed recombinant dmExp5 was incubated with pre-miR-30 in the presence of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 3). These results raise the possibility that the reticulocyte lysate contains an activity that inhibits the binding between pre-miR-30 and dmExp5. Since the rabbit reticulocyte lysate contains a large amount of RNAs, including tRNAs, we explored the issue of whether the RNA fraction extracted from the reticulocyte lysate inhibits the binding between dmExp5 and pre-miR-30. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, dmExp5 did not bind pre-miR-30 in the presence of the RNA fraction (compare lane 3 with 4). On the other hand, the binding of hsExp5 to pre-miRNA was unaffected under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>, lane 1).</p><p>To identify RNAs that cause the inhibition of binding between dmExp5 and pre-miR-30, dmExp5 expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> as a histidine-tagged fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was mixed with the rabbit reticulocyte lysate and immunoprecipitated with an anti-penta-His antibody. The co-precipitated RNAs were visualized by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. The bacterially expressed recombinant dmExp5 immunoprecipitated tRNAs only in the presence of dmRanQ69L-GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Although the ability to bind tRNAs is conserved among the Exp5 orthologues from different species, we noticed that dmExp5 was able to immunoprecipitate the greatest amount of tRNAs among them. On the other hand, exportin-1 (Exp1) did not bind tRNAs at all.</p><p>To directly confirm that tRNAs actually inhibit the binding of dmExp5 to pre-miR-30, competition experiments were performed. Purified tRNA-Phe from baker's yeast inhibited dmExp5 from interacting with pre-miR-30 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, upper panel, lanes 2&#x02013;5), whereas negligible competition was found for binding between pre-miR-30 and hsExp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, upper panel, lanes 10&#x02013;14). Only a marginal effect was observed when U1&#x00394;smRNA was used as a competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, upper panel, lanes 6&#x02013;9). From these results, we conclude that dmExp5 preferentially binds to tRNA compared with hsExp5.</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of dmExp5 in Drosophila S2 cells decreases the amounts of tRNA and miRNA</title><p>Having established that dmExp5 fulfils the functional characteristics as an exportin for both miRNA and tRNA, we then examined whether dmExp5 functions as a sole exportin for both tRNAs and miRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. For this, we inactivated dmExp5 by RNAi-mediated gene silencing and measured the amounts of mature tRNA and miRNA, which we took for an indirect indication for their export defect as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the knockdown of dmExp5 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells was confirmed by RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left panels). A significant decrease in tRNA-Met and tRNA-Ser as well as miR-2 levels was observed by the knockdown of dmExp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right panels). On the contrary, upon depletion of hsExp5 in 293F cells, which was confirmed by a western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left panels), the amounts of tRNA-Met and tRNA-Ser remained unaffected, whereas a significant decrease in mature let-7a was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right panels) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In both experiments, the amounts of U6 snRNA and U1 snRNA were not altered. In addition, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, depletion of dmDGCR8 or dmDrosha (left panels), which are known components of the nuclear pri-miRNA processing complex, led to a significant decrease in the amount of mature miR-2. However, only marginal effects in tRNA levels were observed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). These findings exclude the possibility that the repression of tRNA caused by the depletion of dmExp5 in S2 cells was a secondary effect due to the loss of miRNA function. From these results, we conclude that dmExp5 plays important roles, not only in miRNA expression, but also in tRNA expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To further test if the observed effects by dmExp5 depletion could be rescued by hsExp5, complementation experiments were performed using S2 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged hsExp5 (S2/hsExp5). S2 cells stably transfected with an empty vector (S2/Emp) served as a negative control. The knockdown of dmExp5 was checked by RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, upper and middle panels), while the expression of hsExp5 was confirmed by western blot using an anti-FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lower panel). In the S2/Emp, the amounts of miR-2 and tRNA-Ser decreased to 34 and 66% of the control level, respectively (lane 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> top and middle panels). In contrast, when RNAi against dmExp5 was performed in S2/hsExp5, the amount of miR-2 decreased but to a much lower extent (68% of the control cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, top panel, right most lane), indicating that exogenously expressed hsExp5 significantly rescued the expression of pre-miRNA. In the same cells, the expression of tRNA-Ser was not rescued so efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, middle panel). Unfortunately, a direct comparison between hsExp5 and hsExp-t could not be done, since we failed to obtain stable transformants of S2 cells that express sufficient amounts of hsExp-t (data not shown). These results indicate that the activity of dmExp5 is at least partially substituted by the expression of hsExp5 and that dmExp5 and hsExp5 are distinctly involved in the expression of pre-miRNA and tRNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, three Exp5 orthologues from different species were extensively characterized. We found that, although the dsRNA binding abilities are well conserved from the budding yeast to human orthologues, certain differences exist in their optimal substrates. Msn5p binds the shorter dsRNA more efficiently than the longer hairpin like RNA (e.g. pre-miR-30), which was found to be the optimal substrate for human and fruit fly Exp5 by others as well as ourselves. In addition, recent studies have shown that, in plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, miRNAs are detected as fully matured &#x0223c;22 nt single stranded RNAs in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), indicating that HASTY, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Exp5 orthologue, likely recognizes such short RNAs as cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). HASTY might inherit the observed substrate preference of yeast Msn5p, leading to the recognition of &#x0223c;22 nt duplex RNAs as cargoes. These results suggest that the Exp5 orthologues have evolved different modes of substrate recognition to play different functional roles.</p><p>In vertebrates and plants, Exp5 is thought to act as a major exportin for pre-miRNAs and to play a minor role in the nuclear export of tRNAs. Consistent with this, we found that hsExp5 bound pre-miRNAs more efficiently than tRNAs and that the depletion of hsExp5 in human cells resulted in defects in miRNA but not in tRNA expression. On the other hand, it was reported that a decrease in tRNA levels, but not in miRNA levels, was observed in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HASTY mutant, whereas the PAUSED mutation, which is the Exp-t orthologue of <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> interfered with tRNA-Tyr processing without obvious effects on miRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). In contrast, a previous report indicated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not posses an apparent orthologue of Exp-t (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Despite repeated efforts, we also failed to identify the Exp-t gene in the <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> and <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> genomes. On the other hand, a putative Exp-t orthologue, designated as importin-&#x003b2; family 6 (Imb-6; GenBank accession NM_068919), was identified in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. Thus, we speculate that the Exp-t gene might have been lost when the coelomata diverged from the bilateria. Instead, the following experimental evidence supports the notion that dmExp5 may have evolved as a substitute for the Exp-t function in such organisms. We demonstrated here that the depletion of dmExp5 in S2 cells induced the down regulation of both miRNAs and tRNAs and that dmExp5 binds tRNA with a higher affinity than hsExp5. From these results, we conclude that dmExp5, different from the other Exp5 orthologues, functions as a major export factor in the nuclear export of tRNAs as well as miRNAs in the fruit fly.</p><p>In budding yeast cells, Msn5p is known to be involved in the nuclear export of both tRNAs and a subset of proteins. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data indicate that Msn5p is able to directly recognize RNAs. On the other hand, NESs of the protein cargoes recognized by Msn5p still remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Does Msn5p recognize both peptide sequences (or protein structure) and RNAs directly? As far as we know, there is no precedent for such a dual specificity in the importin-&#x003b2; family proteins. What common structural feature(s) in the different cargoes, then, can be recognized as NES by Msn5p? Of note in this context are the recent reports showing that, in mammalian cells JAZ and Staufen, dsRNA binding proteins involved in mRNA metabolism, are indirectly recognized by Exp5 via their affinities to small dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). To recognize the protein cargoes, mammalian Exp5 exploits dsRNAs as bridging factors. In yeast, Crz1p, which is functionally homologous to NFATs derived from higher eukaryotes, was reported to be exported by Msn5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Because it was recently demonstrated that an ncRNA is involved in the nuclear localization of mammalian NFATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), it is conceivable that NFATs have the ability to bind directly or indirectly RNAs. Therefore, it would be very tempting to speculate that Msn5p, via its affinity to small dsRNAs, indirectly recognizes the protein cargoes. Recent genome wide transcription profiling studies suggest that a large proportion of the genome including intergenic regions, is transcribed in both directions in various organisms. These observations indicate that the expression of non-coding RNAs and possibly dsRNAs is more widespread in eukaryotic cells than has ever been expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Further experiments will be required to determine whether such bridging dsRNAs do exist.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs Mutsuhito Ohno (Kyoto University) and Tohru Yoshihisa (Nagoya University) for providing various plasmids.

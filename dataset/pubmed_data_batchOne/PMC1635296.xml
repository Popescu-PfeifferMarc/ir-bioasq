Here we show that RECQ5&#x003b2; promotes strand exchange between arms of synthetic forked DNA structures resembling a stalled replication fork in a reaction dependent on ATP hydrolysis. BLM and WRN can also promote strand exchange on these structures. However, in the presence of human replication protein A (hRPA), the action of these RecQ-type helicases is strongly biased towards unwinding of the parental duplex, an effect not seen with RECQ5&#x003b2;. A domain within the non-conserved portion of RECQ5&#x003b2; is identified as being important for its ability to unwind the lagging-strand arm and to promote strand exchange on hRPA-coated forked structures. We also show that RECQ5&#x003b2; associates with DNA replication factories in S phase nuclei and persists at the sites of stalled replication forks after exposure of cells to UV irradiation. Moreover, RECQ5&#x003b2; is found to physically interact with the polymerase processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Collectively, these findings suggest that RECQ5&#x003b2; may promote regression of stalled replication forks to facilitate the bypass of replication-blocking lesions by template-switching. Loss of such activity could explain the elevated level of mitotic crossovers observed in RECQ5&#x003b2;-deficient cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The progression of DNA replication forks is frequently impaired by DNA damage, particularly if the blocking lesion is located on the leading-strand template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). In this case, synthesis of the leading strand is halted at the lesion, while the lagging-strand synthesis continues beyond the lesion site, resulting in a fork structure with an extensive gap in the leading strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Replication fork stalling poses a serious threat to genomic stability because it can trigger unscheduled DNA recombination events and hence lead to gross chromosomal re-arrangements that can induce tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). To avoid these detrimental consequences of DNA replication arrest, cells can switch to different DNA damage bypass modes that permit replication across the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). One of these mechanisms is proposed to involve a transient template switch to the undamaged sister chromatid, allowing the replicative polymerase to synthesize the sequence complementary to the blocking lesion in an error-free manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). It is believed that such template-switching is achieved by a movement of the fork backward so as to re-anneal the original template strands and displace the newly synthesized strands which themselves anneal to generate a Holliday junction structure with a short arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Indeed, such structures have been observed to accumulate upon replication arrest both in prokaryotic and in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). However, it is not clear whether the formation of these structures is promoted enzymatically or occurs spontaneously.</p><p>Proteins belonging to the RecQ family of 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; DNA helicases are implicated in the processing of aberrant DNA structures arising during DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Defects in three of the five known human RecQ homologues have been found to be associated with different autosomal recessive disorders characterized by genomic instability and cancer predisposition&#x02014;mutations in BLM, WRN and RECQ4 give rise to Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome and Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). BLM is known to suppress crossovers during homologous recombination (HR) presumably through its unique ability to act in conjunction with DNA topoisomerase III&#x003b1; to decatenate recombination intermediates containing double Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). WRN promotes lagging-strand replication of G-rich telomeric regions and resolves telomeric D-loops in a manner regulated by the TRF1 and TRF2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). RECQ4 is proposed to be important for the initiation of DNA replication by promoting the loading of replication protein A on unwound origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>The role of the human RECQ5 protein in the maintenance of genomic stability remains to be elucidated. The inactivation of the <italic>Recq5</italic> gene in mouse embryonic stem cells results in a significant increase in the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) comparable to that caused by <italic>Blm</italic> gene inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Deletion of both <italic>Recq5</italic> and <italic>Blm</italic> genes leads to an even higher frequency of SCEs compared to the single mutants, suggesting that BLM and RECQ5 operate in different pathways that suppress mitotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In contrast to the other human RecQ homologues, RECQ5 exists in at least three different isoforms resulting from alternative mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The largest splice variant, RECQ5&#x003b2; functions not only as a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; DNA helicase, but also possesses an intrinsic DNA strand-annealing activity residing in the unique C-terminal half of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). This strand-annealing activity is suppressed if the helicase is in its ATP-bound state, suggesting that RECQ5&#x003b2; may mediate DNA transactions that require a coordinated action of helicase and strand-annealing activities, such as replication fork regression.</p><p>Here we show that the RECQ5&#x003b2; helicase has the ability to promote strand exchange between arms of synthetic forked DNA structures that resemble a stalled replication fork in a reaction stimulated by the human replication protein A (hRPA). In contrast, hRPA is found to block strand exchange by BLM and WRN by driving these helicases to mediate unwinding of the parental duplex. On forked DNA structures with heterologous arms, RECQ5&#x003b2; preferentially unwinds the lagging-strand duplex, whereas BLM and WRN show a strong preference for unwinding of the parental duplex even in the absence of hRPA. The ability of RECQ5&#x003b2; to catalyze the lagging-strand unwinding and strand exchange on hRPA-coated forked structures is dependent on a short region located within the non-conserved portion of RECQ5&#x003b2;. In addition, we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that RECQ5&#x003b2; localizes to DNA replication factories in S phase nuclei and persists at the sites of stalled replication forks. Moreover, we have found that RECQ5&#x003b2; physically interacts with the polymerase processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Based on these findings, we propose that RECQ5&#x003b2; could mediate regression of stalled replication forks to facilitate DNA damage bypass by template-switching.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructions and protein purifications</title><p>The bacterial expression vectors for the RECQ5&#x003b2; fragments encompassing the amino acid residues 1&#x02013;774 (pPG13) and 542&#x02013;991 (pPG14), fused to the C-terminus of glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST), were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding regions of the RECQ5&#x003b2; cDNA and their insertion in pGEX-2TK between the EcoRI and BamHI sites.

For the strand exchange assays, 1 nM RK1/RK2 partial duplex was incubated with 40 nM RECQ5&#x003b2; and either 1 nM RK3 oligonucleotide or 1 nM RK3/RK4 partial duplex in a volume of 100 &#x003bc;l of buffer HA to generate forked DNA structures depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, respectively.

First, we prepared a partial forked duplex lacking the leading strand (3&#x02032;-flap duplex) by RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated annealing of a 60mer oligonucleotide representing the leading-strand template to a 3&#x02032;-tailed duplex composed of a 30mer oligonucleotide and a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 60mer oligonucleotide representing the lagging strand and the corresponding template strand, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This resulted in a rapid formation of the forked structure as detected by electrophoresis in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by phosphorimaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;8). A small amount of the 60mer duplex was also detected, which had presumably arisen from spontaneous branch migration. Remarkably, upon the addition of ATP to this mixture, a robust strand-exchange activity was observed, resulting in the formation of the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 60mer duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">C</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;15). Note that this duplex contains a small bubble due to the short region of heterology at the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When ATP was substituted with its poorly hydrolysable analogue ATP&#x003b3;S, no strand exchange was observed over the period of 32 min, confirming that the RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated strand exchange is dependent on the helicase activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">C</xref>, lanes 16&#x02013;22).</p><p>Certain RecQ DNA helicases such as human RECQ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) have been shown to be sensitive to free magnesium cations. Hence, we sought to determine the optimal Mg<sup>2+</sup>:ATP ratio for RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated strand exchange reaction. To do so, we varied Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the range from 0 to 10 mM keeping ATP at a fixed concentration of 2 mM. We found that the extent of RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated strand exchange on the 3&#x02032;-flap substrate increased with increasing Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration in a hyperbolic fashion, reaching maximal values at Mg<sup>2+</sup>:ATP ratios between 3 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data indicated that RECQ5&#x003b2; requires a molar excess of Mg<sup>2+</sup> over ATP for efficient strand exchange activity. Therefore, all further experiments were performed using 2 mM ATP and 10 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Next we investigated whether RECQ5&#x003b2; can promote strand exchange if the forked structure contains both the lagging and the leading strands. To mimic the structure of a replication fork blocked by a lesion on the leading-strand template, the length of the leading strand was chosen to be 10 nt shorter than the length of the lagging strand. The DNA substrate was again assembled using the strand-annealing function of RECQ5&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Upon the addition of ATP, a rapid accumulation of free <sup>32</sup>P-labeled leading oligonucleotide was observed in the initial stages of the reaction which was followed by its annealing to the lagging oligonucleotide as evidenced by an accumulation of the 20mer/30mer duplex in the later stage of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;15). This indicates that RECQ5&#x003b2; has the ability to promote the displacement of both arms of the fork and subsequent annealing of the displaced leading and lagging strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and C). No strand exchange was seen in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S, indicating a requirement for the helicase activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 16&#x02013;22).</p><p>It is known that RPA covers single-stranded regions at stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the effect of hRPA on the strand-exchange activity of RECQ5&#x003b2; using the synthetic forked structures described above. To monitor the annealing of the parental strands on the gapped fork structure, <sup>32</sup>P-label was also placed on the lagging-strand template. These experiments indicated that hRPA did not impair the RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated annealing of the parental strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and C). However, it was found to partially inhibit the annealing of the displaced leading and lagging oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is consistent with our earlier studies, which indicated that hRPA inhibits RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated strand annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). A partial shift of the reaction towards unwinding of the parental duplex was also observed, particularly with the gapped substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 6). However, this is not likely to be the consequence of binding of hRPA to the leading arm, since the single-strand gap on the gapped fork structure is too short (10 nt) to accommodate hRPA, assuming that the size of the DNA-binding site for RPA is &#x0223c;30 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, the findings described above suggested that RECQ5&#x003b2; is capable of promoting fork regression <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>RPA blocks strand exchange by BLM and WRN</title><p>We also examined other human RecQ homologues, namely BLM and WRN, for the ability to promote strand exchange on the 3&#x02032;-flap structure described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As WRN showed only negligible strand-annealing activity under the condition of our assay, the DNA substrate was prepared by spontaneous annealing of the constituent oligonucleotides, with the lagging oligonucleotide being present in a 5-fold molar excess over the parental strands. We found that both BLM and WRN could efficiently catalyze the conversion of the 3&#x02032;-flap structure into the 60mer duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). However, if hRPA was present in the reaction, the action of both helicases was strongly biased toward unwinding of the parental duplex, as evidenced by the accumulation of the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 30mer/60mer duplex in the course of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and D). In contrast, these time course experiments revealed that hRPA significantly stimulated the rate and the extent of RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated strand exchange on 3&#x02032;-flap structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>These data indicate that there are mechanistic differences between RECQ5&#x003b2; and other human RecQ helicases in the mode of processing of forked DNA structures coated with hRPA.</p></sec><sec><title>RECQ5&#x003b2; actively unwinds only the lagging-strand arm of the fork</title><p>To gain insights into the mechanism of RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated strand exchange, we investigated the action of RECQ5&#x003b2; on synthetic forked structures with heterologous arms to monitor only DNA unwinding events.

Interestingly, this reaction was significantly enhanced if the DNA substrate was pre-incubated with hRPA (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). This could be the consequence of binding of hRPA to the single-stranded leading arm that would prevent loading of RECQ5&#x003b2; on this arm to initiate unwinding of the parental duplex. In agreement with this assumption, we found that hRPA inhibited RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated unwinding of a 3&#x02032;-tailed duplex if added to the DNA substrate prior to the helicase (data not shown). However, no significant stimulation of RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated unwinding of the lagging-strand arm was observed with the <italic>E.coli</italic> single-stranded binding protein, indicating that this effect is specific for hRPA (Supplementary Figure S1).</p><p>To assess whether the RECQ5&#x003b2; helicase can actively unwind the leading arm of the fork, we examined its activity on partial forked duplex lacking the lagging strand (5&#x02032;-flap duplex). We found that RECQ5&#x003b2; could catalyze only the unwinding of the parental arm on this structure, as evidenced by the accumulation of 5&#x02032;-tailed duplex during the course of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). This was, however, seen only in the presence of hRPA, which is consistent with our previous finding that hRPA counteracts the intrinsic strand-annealing activity of RECQ5&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In the later stages of the hRPA-containing reaction, accumulation of the free leading oligonucleotide was also observed, which presumably resulted from a secondary unwinding event on the primary 5&#x02032;-tail product. This observation is intriguing since the RECQ5&#x003b2; helicase was shown to exhibit a 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). It is possible that hRPA, if bound to the 5&#x02032;-single stranded tail, can partially destabilize the duplex, which would allow loading of RECQ5&#x003b2; to mediate unwinding.</p><p>To further confirm that the RECQ5&#x003b2; helicase cannot actively remove the leading strand from the fork, we examined its action on a 5&#x02032;-flap structure with homologous arms prepared from the same set of oligonucleotides as used in the previous strand exchange assays. If RECQ5&#x003b2; was capable of unwinding of the leading arm, it would promote strand exchange on this structure to form the 60mer duplex as it did on the homologous 3&#x02032;-flap structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, RECQ5&#x003b2; did not show any strand-exchange activity on the 5&#x02032;-flap structure, indicating that it cannot actively unwind the leading arm (Supplementary Figure S2).</p><p>We also examined the action of the BLM and WRN helicases on the forked DNA structures with heterologous arms described above. In contrast to RECQ5&#x003b2;, BLM and WRN displayed a strong preference for unwinding of the parental arm on all these structures, which was further enhanced by hRPA (Supplementary Figure S3). These findings are in agreement with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) and further highlight mechanistic differences between RECQ5&#x003b2; and other human RecQ helicases in processing of forked DNA structures.</p></sec><sec><title>A domain within the non-conserved portion of RECQ5&#x003b2; is important for RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated processing of forked DNA structures</title><p>To identify the functional domains in RECQ5&#x003b2; that are required for its ability to unwind the lagging arm of the fork and to promote strand exchange on forked structures in the presence of hRPA, we purified a series of truncated variants of RECQ5&#x003b2; lacking different parts of the region distal to the conserved helicase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The RECQ5&#x003b2; variants lacking the C-terminal 266 or 340 amino acids (RECQ5<sup>1&#x02013;725</sup> and RECQ5<sup>1&#x02013;651</sup>) were found to be proficient in promoting strand exchange on hRPA-coated forked structure lacking the leading strand albeit with a reduced efficiency compared to the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, these variants retained the capacity to preferentially unwind the lagging-strand duplex on the forked structure with heterologous arms, being even more efficient than the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This correlates with the fact that these mutants were severely impaired in promoting strand annealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, the RECQ5<sup>1&#x02013;475</sup> and RECQ5<sup>1&#x02013;561</sup> mutants were defective in promoting strand exchange and unwinding of the lagging arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). However, these mutants could catalyze unwinding of the parental arm on the partial forked duplex lacking the leading strand, indicating that they retained the capacity to initiate duplex unwinding from a single-stranded tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these data indicate that the region of RECQ5&#x003b2; spanning the amino acids 561&#x02013;651 is important for the processing of forked structures by this helicase.</p></sec><sec><title>RECQ5&#x003b2; is localized in DNA replication factories and persists at sites of stalled replication forks</title><p>To explore whether RECQ5&#x003b2; acts at DNA replications forks <italic>in vivo</italic>, we investigated its subcellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy relative to PCNA that is widely used as a marker for DNA replication foci. It is known that PCNA foci undergo reproducible changes throughout S phase, with a fine punctuate pattern in early S, perinuclear and perinucleolar patterns in mid S and a characteristic late-S pattern with a few, but large foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). To monitor the RECQ5&#x003b2; localization pattern during S phase, we synchronized HeLa cells at the G<sub>1</sub>/S transition by HU treatment and fixed them with methanol at different time points after release from the arrest. In addition to immunostaining, the cells were subjected to flow cytometry to determine the cell cycle distribution at individual time points. We observed that in HU-arrested cells, both PCNA and RECQ5&#x003b2; displayed exclusively nuclear staining, forming a large number of foci that partially co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Three hours after the removal of HU (early S phase), &#x0003e;80% of PCNA foci in a single nucleus co-localized with RECQ5&#x003b2; foci in the majority of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Six hours after release (mid-S phase), the PCNA foci exhibited the characteristic peripheral pattern, while the RECQ5&#x003b2; foci were dispersed throughout the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Nine hours after release (late S phase), both PCNA and RECQ5&#x003b2; formed a few large foci that almost completely co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We also examined the spatial distribution of RECQ5&#x003b2; and PCNA during S phase of U2OS osteosarcoma cells and obtained essentially the same results as in HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S4). Moreover, in synchronized U2OS cells, the RECQ5&#x003b2; foci co-localized with sites of BrdU incorporation, a marker of ongoing DNA synthesis (Supplementary Figure S4). Using U2OS cells, we also found that the RECQ5&#x003b2; foci in late S phase co-localized with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), indicating that RECQ5&#x003b2; associates with PML nuclear bodies in this stage of the cell cycle (Supplementary Figure S5).</p><p>Next we investigated the effect of exogenously induced replication-blocking lesions on the cellular localization pattern of RECQ5&#x003b2; in non-synchronized HeLa cells. To induce the formation of bulky DNA adducts, cells were exposed to UVC irradiation or treated with CDDP. In asynchronous populations of cycling HeLa cells (&#x0223c;70% of cells in G<sub>1</sub> as judged from the FACS profile), PCNA showed mostly a diffuse nuclear staining, whereas RECQ5&#x003b2; displayed rather a punctuate distribution in the nucleus as well as a weak cytoplasmic staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In a small percentage of cells (&#x0223c;15%), PCNA was concentrated in small nuclear foci, indicating that these cells were in S phase (data not shown). Most importantly, these PCNA foci largely co-localized with RECQ5&#x003b2; foci, which excludes the possibility that the pattern observed 3 h after HU removal was a consequence of DNA damage caused by HU treatment (data not shown; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>After exposure of cells to UV irradiation at a dosage of 20 J/m<sup>2</sup>, there was a dramatic increase in the percentage of cells in which PCNA foci co-localized with RECQ5&#x003b2; foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Four hours after UV irradiation, &#x0223c;80% of PCNA foci in a single nucleus co-localized with RECQ5&#x003b2; foci in 55% of cells. These foci appeared somewhat brighter than those observed in early S phase cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and persisted up to 6 h after irradiation (data not shown).</p><p>In HeLa cells treated with CDDP (20 &#x003bc;M), which predominantly causes intra-strand DNA cross-links mimicking pyrimidine&#x02013;dimer adducts induced by UV light, RECQ5&#x003b2; and PCNA displayed essentially the same spatial distribution as in UV-irradiated cells, with the maximal co-localization being apparent 6 h after addition of the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Moreover, we examined spatial distribution of RECQ5&#x003b2; in SV40-immortalized human fibroblasts GM00637 and XP20SSV (XPA-deficient) before and after UV irradiation. We observed essentially the same patterns as in HeLa cells, excluding a cell-line specific effect (Supplementary Figure S6). In addition, the experiment with XPA-deficient cells ruled out the possibility that RECQ5&#x003b2; is present in the complexes that mediate repair synthesis following excision of DNA adducts by the nucleotide-excision repair pathway.</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that RECQ5&#x003b2; is associated with the DNA replication machinery, particularly in early and late S phase and it is present in replication-repair factories at the sites of stalled replication forks.</p></sec><sec><title>RECQ5&#x003b2; directly interacts with PCNA</title><p>In addition to serving as a sliding clamp required for processive DNA synthesis, PCNA provides attachment sites for various other proteins that function in DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cycle progression and chromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). To further explore the association of RECQ5&#x003b2; with the DNA replication machinery, we examined whether it interacts with PCNA, as suggested by the presence of a putative PCNA-binding motif at the C-terminus of RECQ5&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). First, we performed affinity pull-down assays with recombinant proteins produced in <italic>E.coli</italic>. We found that PCNA was bound to chitin beads coated with RECQ5&#x003b2;-CBD protein, but not to beads coated with McrA-CBD protein, indicating that the interaction was specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Moreover, using GST-tagged RECQ5&#x003b2; deletion variants, we found that the region spanning the last 200 amino acids of RECQ5&#x003b2; is essential for its interaction with PCNA, suggesting that this interaction is mediated through the putative PCNA-binding motif located in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the effect of PCNA on the strand exchange activity of RECQ5&#x003b2; using the synthetic forked DNA structure containing a 10 nt gap on the leading arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that PCNA did not affect the rate or the extent of RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated strand exchange (Supplementary Figure S7).</p><p>To see whether RECQ5&#x003b2; interacts with PCNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments with total extracts of human 293T embryonic kidney cells. Extracts were prepared not only from non-treated cells, but also from cells synchronized in early S phase and cells subjected to UV irradiation or CDDP treatment, since under these conditions, RECQ5&#x003b2; was found to localize to PCNA foci. We found that PCNA was precipitated with the anti-RECQ5&#x003b2; antibody, but not with control IgGs purified from pre-immune serum, indicating that RECQ5&#x003b2; and PCNA indeed form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Moreover, a significant larger amount of PCNA (&#x0223c;2 times) was detected in the immunoprecipitates of treated cells compared with non-treated cells, suggesting that the observed recruitment of RECQ5&#x003b2; to replication foci may occur via a direct interaction with PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, compare lane 3 to lanes 4&#x02013;6).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>There is growing evidence suggesting that RecQ DNA helicases operate in various DNA repair processes induced by DNA replication defects. However, the DNA transactions mediated by these proteins at damaged replication forks still remain elusive. Here we show that the human RECQ5&#x003b2; helicase possesses the ability to promote strand exchange on synthetic forked DNA structures that mimic a stalled replication fork. Moreover, we provide evidence suggesting that the RECQ5&#x003b2; protein is localized in the DNA replication factories in S phase nuclei and persists at the sites of stalled replication forks. Based on these findings, we speculate that the RECQ5&#x003b2; helicase could mediate regression of stalled replication forks <italic>in vivo</italic> to facilitate DNA damage bypass by template-switching (Supplementary Figure S8). As mentioned above, such a DNA damage tolerance mechanism has been postulated to exist in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, but remains to be substantiated experimentally. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, fork regression associated with template-switching is thought to be the underlying mechanism of the <italic>RAD5</italic>-subpathway of <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent postreplicative repair, which is highly conserved from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). As this DNA damage tolerance process, which involves non-destructive polyubiquitination of PCNA, is largely independent of the HR machinery, other means, such as helicase-promoted DNA unwinding, would be required to accomplish the strand-exchange events required for fork regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). At present, however, it is not clear whether Sgs1 helicase, the sole RecQ homologue in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, is involved in the RAD6-dependent DNA damage tolerance, since the assessment of this possibility by epistatic analysis is complicated due to the involvement of Sgs1 in the HR pathway of postreplicative repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Nevertheless, some evidence for such a function has been provided in the fission yeast <italic>Saccharomyces pombe</italic> by the observation that the formation of Rqh1 (Sgs1 homologue) foci upon UV irradiation is dependent on the presence of Rdh18/Rad18, a component of the Rad6 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).</p><p>Our hypothesis that RECQ5&#x003b2; operates in the repair of damaged replication forks is consistent with the finding that inactivation of the mouse RECQ5&#x003b2; homologue is associated with a significant increase in the frequency of SCEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), as these may represent cross-over outcomes of the HR-mediated repair of broken replication forks that arise as a consequence of the blockage of leading-strand extension by bulky lesions (Supplementary Figure S8). Similarly, elevated SCE levels have been observed in DT40 chicken cells lacking the trans-lesion polymerases Pol&#x003b6; and Pol&#x003ba;, or the Rad18 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). However, one cannot exclude the possibility that the increased level of mitotic recombination associated with RECQ5&#x003b2; deficiency results from a defect in another DNA repair mechanisms. For example, RECQ5&#x003b2; could operate in the synthesis-dependent strand-annealing pathway of DNA double-strand break repair by disrupting D-loops and promoting annealing of extended arms of the broken chromosome. Alternatively, RECQ5&#x003b2; could suppress unscheduled recombination during DNA replication by directly displacing inappropriately formed RAD51 filaments in the same manner as the Srs2 and UvrD helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).</p><p>The biochemical and structural studies have revealed that the <italic>E.coli</italic> RecG helicase mediates fork regression by active unwinding of both the leading and lagging arms of the fork using a wedge domain that is simultaneously pushed into the lagging and the leading duplexes promoting strand displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). In contrast to RecG, the RECQ5&#x003b2; helicase was found to unwind only the lagging-strand duplex, which raises the question of how it can promote fork regression beyond the leading-strand gap. We propose a mechanism in which RECQ5&#x003b2; binds to the fork junction and subsequently translocates along the lagging-strand template in the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; direction to unwind the lagging-strand duplex. As a result, the parental strands will be free to re-anneal. Interestingly, we identified a region of 90 amino acids, located within the non-conserved portion of RECQ5&#x003b2;, as being required for its ability to unwind the lagging arm of the fork, but not for RECQ5&#x003b2;-mediated unwinding of 3&#x02032;-tailed DNA duplexes. It is therefore plausible to propose that this domain may govern the loading of the RECQ5&#x003b2; helicase on the fork junction, placing the helicase motor on the parental duplex in such an orientation as to allow translocation towards the lagging arm. Furthermore, we propose that when the moving junction encounters the leading strand, spontaneous strand exchange will take place, resulting in the displacement of the leading strand and its annealing to the displaced lagging strand to form a four-way junction. This reaction will be favoured due to the concomitant unwinding of the lagging arm by RECQ5&#x003b2;. It is also possible that the annealing events occurring during the fork regression process are promoted by the C-terminal strand-annealing domain of RECQ5&#x003b2;, since we found that the deletion variants RECQ5<sup>1&#x02013;725</sup> and RECQ5<sup>1&#x02013;651</sup> were dramatically compromised for the strand-annealing activity and showed reduced strand-exchange activity relative to the wild-type protein.</p><p>A previous study demonstrated that BLM and WRN have the capacity to promote strand exchange on oligonucleotide-based substrates through combining their strand-pairing and helicase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). More recently, the BLM helicase has been found to promote fork regression on plasmid-sized substrates, generating a four-way structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Interestingly, we found that hRPA, which covers single-stranded regions at stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), strongly modulated the action of the BLM and WRN helicases at the fork to favour unwinding of the parental duplex, which is consistent with the previous reports demonstrating that hRPA increases the processivity of the BLM and WRN helicases through direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). However, these experiments using short DNA substrates cannot account for the possibility that fork regression is mediated by another helicase molecule loaded on the liberated lagging-strand template, an model proposed for the <italic>E.coli</italic> RecQ helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). To assess which human RecQ helicase is more likely to promote fork regression <italic>in vivo</italic>, the effect of hRPA on fork regression by BLM, WRN and RECQ5&#x003b2; is currently being investigated using a plasmid-sized forked DNA structure containing an extensive leading-strand gap.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec>

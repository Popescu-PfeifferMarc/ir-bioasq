To understand the control of gene expression by these factors, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays identified <italic>Msx2</italic> as a downstream target of Dlx2 and Lef-1. Dlx2 activates the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter in several cell lines and binds DNA as a monomer and dimer. A Lef-1 &#x003b2;-catenin-dependent isoform minimally activates the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter and a Lef-1 &#x003b2;-catenin-independent isoform is inactive, however co-expression of Dlx2 and both Lef-1 isoforms synergistically activate the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter. Co-immunoprecipitation and protein pull-down experiments demonstrate Lef-1 physically interacts with Dlx2. Deletion analyses of the Lef-1 protein reveal specific regions required for synergism with Dlx2. The Lef-1 &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain (&#x003b2;DB) is not required for its interaction with Dlx2. Msx2 can auto-regulate its promoter and repress Dlx2 activation. Msx2 repression of Dlx2 activation is dose-specific and both bind a common DNA-binding element. These transcriptional mechanisms correlate with the temporal and spatial expression of these factors and may provide a mechanism for the control of several developmental processes. We demonstrate new transcriptional activities for Dlx2, Msx2 and Lef-1 through protein interactions and identification of downstream targets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The vertebrate <italic>Msx</italic> genes originally cloned from mice, are homologous to the <italic>Drosophila muscle segment homeobox</italic> gene (msh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). There are three unlinked mammalian <italic>Msx</italic> gene family members consisting of Msx1, Msx2 and Msx3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Msx3 has a restricted expression pattern and is seen only in the dorsal neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). However, Msx1 and Msx2 are expressed in many organs and strongly expressed in developing craniofacial regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Msx2 is expressed in epithelial-mesenchymal tissue interactions of several organs including teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Unlike <italic>Msx1</italic>, which is confined to the mesenchyme throughout tooth development, <italic>Msx2</italic> expression is observed in the epithelial and mesenchymal regions of the developing tooth germs. <italic>Msx2</italic> mutations are associated with tooth defects and <italic>Msx2</italic> deficient mice demonstrate developmental defects in ectodermal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Consistent with <italic>Msx2</italic> expression occurring after the early expression of <italic>Pitx2</italic>, <italic>Lef-1</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> in the dental epithelium, <italic>Msx2</italic> mutant mice teeth develop normally through the early stages of development but have defects associated with late tooth morphogenesis and amelogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p><italic>Msx2</italic> homeobox gene expression can be observed in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and other regions of the developing limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The expression of the chick <italic>Msx2</italic> gene in the AER and other regions of the developing limb is dependent on multiple closely spaced regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Msx2</italic> and <italic>Dlx</italic> genes have highly localized expression patterns in the AER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p><italic>Dlx2</italic>, a member of the distal-less gene family, has been established as a regulator of branchial arch development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Homozygous mutants of <italic>Dlx2</italic> have abnormal development of forebrain cells and craniofacial abnormalities in developing neural tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Dlx2 can regulate Dlx5 and/or Dlx6 expression and ectopic expression of Dlx2 induced Dlx5 expression in slice cultures of the mouse embryonic cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Furthermore, ectopic expression of Dlx2 can induce the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Analyses of the Dlx1/2 mutant mice demonstrate a decrease in expression of Aristaless, which may control the development of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p><p><italic>Dlx2</italic> is also expressed in the first branchial arch and is involved in tooth development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). <italic>Dlx</italic> genes are believed to play a role in tooth morphogenesis because homozygous <italic>Dlx1/Dlx2</italic> mutants are missing maxillary molars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The overlapping expression patterns of Msx and Dlx genes in the branchial arches, AER, teeth and brain suggest an interactive role for these transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (Lef-1) is a cell type-specific transcription factor expressed in lymphocytes of the adult mouse and in the neural crest, mesencephalon, tooth germs, whisker follicles and other sites during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Lef-1 is a member of the high mobility group (HMG) family of proteins and activates transcription only in collaboration with other DNA-binding proteins and may promote the assembly of a higher-order nucleoprotein complex by juxtaposing non-adjacent factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). <italic>Lef-1</italic> expression overlaps that of <italic>Dlx2</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic> in the dental epithelium, branchial arches and limb buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p><italic>Msx2</italic> expression is detected in tissues specific for <italic>Dlx2</italic> and <italic>Lef-1</italic> expression, which suggests that they functionally interact or regulate the expression of each other. The coordinated expression of genes during development is not regulated by one molecule or transcription factor but by several factors acting together through direct physical contact or through independent DNA-binding to their respective DNA elements. Thus, individual genes are regulated by complexes of factors interacting with regulatory elements consisting of multiple binding sites. This regulatory network provides a mechanism for the temporal and spatial control of gene expression that is absolutely required for embryo development.</p><p>We use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to identify downstream targets of transcription factors involved in embryogenesis and tooth development. The ChIP assay identified Dlx2 binding to the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter in two different cell lines expressing Dlx2 and we confirmed this binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and transient transfection of <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter constructs and expression constructs. New transcriptional mechanisms are demonstrated through direct protein interactions between Dlx2 and Lef-1 in the activation of <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter activity. ChIP assays also revealed Lef-1 binding to the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter. Structure and function analyses demonstrate specific interactions between Dlx2 and Lef-1. Deletion analyses of the Lef-1 protein demonstrate that the &#x003b2;-catenin binding region is not required for its interaction with Dlx2 or synergistic activation of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter. Thus, Dlx2 is a new partner for Lef-1 and appears to be independent of &#x003b2;-catenin. However, two regions of Lef-1 have been identified that interact with Dlx2. Furthermore, Msx2 can auto-regulate its promoter and Msx2 can attenuate Dlx2 activation. Our research demonstrates a functional interaction between Dlx2 and Lef-1 in regulating gene expression and provides a new role for Lef-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay</title><p>Complementary oligonucleotides containing a <italic>Dlx2</italic> binding site within the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter with flanking partial BamHI ends were annealed and filled with Klenow polymerase to generate <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probes for EMSAs, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The sense primer was 5&#x02032;-GATCCGGGTAGAGATTAGTTGAATATCCCTTGGG-3&#x02032; and the anti-sense primer was 5&#x02032;-GATCCCCAAGGGATATTCAACTAATCTCTACCCG-3&#x02032; with the <italic>Dlx2</italic> binding site underlined. The <italic>Dlx2</italic> binding site selected for the EMSA is located at &#x02212;260 to &#x02212;265 (5&#x02032;-TAGTTG-3&#x02032;) of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter. Standard binding assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). A titration of the bacteria expressed and purified Dlx2 and Msx2 proteins were used in the assays. The samples were electrophoresed, visualized and quantitated as described previously, except quantitation of dried gels was performed on the Molecular Dynamics STORM PhosphoImager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis</title><p>The ChIP analysis was performed as described using the ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate) with the following modifications. CHO and LS-8 cells were fed for 24 h, harvested and plated in 60 mm dishes. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 m at 37&#x000b0;C the next day. The cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline with mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail (SIGMA) and lysed in 200 &#x003bc;l SDS lysis buffer for 10 m on ice and sonicated three times for 10 s. The average DNA fragments ranged between &#x0223c;200 and 2000 bp. The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 13 000 r.p.m. for 10 m at 4&#x000b0;C and diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer. The sonicated samples were precleared using Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein A Agarose-50% Slurry for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C and 1% cell lysate was used for input control. Samples were incubated with Dlx2 goat polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Lef-1 mouse monoclonal IgG (Upstate), overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Immune complexes were washed consecutively for 5 m with each of the following solutions: Low salt immune complex wash buffer, High salt immune complex wash buffer, LiCl immune complex wash buffer and TE buffer twice. Complexes were then eluted twice at room temperature for 15 m in elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). Immunoprecipitated DNA was reverse cross-linked at 65&#x000b0;C for 4 h in 200 mM NaCl and phenol/chloroform purified. An aliquot of the immunoprecipitated DNA (5 &#x003bc;l) from non-transfected cells was used for PCR (40 cycles). All reactions were done under an annealing temperature of 57&#x000b0;C. Two primers for amplifying the Dlx2 and Lef-1 binding sites in the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter are as follows: sense- 5&#x02032;-AAGGGAGAAAGGGTAGAG-3&#x02032; and antisense, 5&#x02032;-CCCGCCTGAGAATGTTGG-3&#x02032;. All the PCR products were evaluated on a 1% agarose gel in 1&#x000d7; TBE for appropriate size (272 bp) and confirmed by sequencing. As controls the Msx2 primers were used without chromatin, normal rabbit IgG was used replacing the Dlx2 or Lef-1 antibody to reveal non-specific immunoprecipitation of the chromatin and primers to an unrelated gene were used to demonstrate the specificity of the immunoprecipitated chromatin.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression and promoter constructs</title><p>Expression plasmids containing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter linked to the <italic>Msx2</italic> and <italic>Lef-1</italic> cDNA were constructed in pcDNA 3.1 MycHisC (Invitrogen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The Lef-1 deletion constructs were prepared by PCR amplification of the full-length <italic>Lef-1</italic> cDNA and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 MycHisC vector. The full-length Lef-1 cDNA was PCR amplified using a sense primer containing the Kozak sequence, initiation codon and an XbaI site and an anti-sense primer without the terminator codon containing a KpnI site. This clone is 1193 bp, encodes a protein of 397 residues and includes the &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain (&#x003b2;BD) in the N-terminus. The Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 construct represents a smaller alternative <italic>Lef-1</italic> transcript found in tissues and was cloned using a sense primer containing a kozak sequence, initiation codon and a NotI site. The anti-sense primer contained a HindIII site without the terminator codon is 854 bp and encodes a protein of 284 amino acids. This clone does not include the &#x003b2;BD in the N-terminus. The Lef-1 &#x00394;N295 construct was PCR amplified using a NotI sense primer and a HindIII anti-sense primer; the product was 306 bp and 102 amino acids. It contains the HMG domain. The Lef-1 &#x00394;N363 construct was made using a sense primer containing a BamHI site and HindIII anti-sense primer, is 102 bp and encodes a C-terminal peptide of 34 residues. Lef-1 &#x00394;N113-&#x00394;C34 was made using a NotI sense primer and HindIII anti-sense primer and contains the CAD and HMG domains but not the &#x003b2;BD. It is 752 bp and encodes a protein of 250 residues. Lef-1 &#x00394;N113-&#x00394;C102 was made using a BamHI sense primer and HindIII anti-sense primer and includes only the CAD domain. It is 546 bp and encodes a 182 amino acid protein. All PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into the digested vector.</p><p>The Dlx2 expression plasmid has been previously described (kindly provided by Dr John Rubenstein, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA). The <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter construct (kindly provided by Dr Y. Chen, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA) was digested with XhoI and NotI to isolate a 5.8 kB fragment, which was ligated into the luciferase vector [previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>)] using BamHI/XhoI and NotI/HindIII linkers. This created the Msx2-5820 luciferase reporter construct. The Msx2-872 construct was made by digesting Msx2-5820 with BamHI and HindIII and the resulting 872 bp fragment was ligated into the luciferase vector. The Msx2-238 construct was made by PCR using primers containing BamHI and HindIII sites. PCR products were TAE gel purified if necessary. All PCR products were ligated into the vector using the Rapid DNA ligation kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and then transformed into DH5&#x003b1; competent cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation for use in the transfection assays. A CMV or SV-40 &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter plasmid (Clontech) was also purified for co-transfection in all experiments as a control for transfection efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture, transient transfections, luciferase and &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays</title><p>CHO, C3H10T1/2 and LS-8 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin and transfected by electroporation. Cultures were fed 24 h prior to transfection, resuspended in PBS and mixed with 2.5 &#x003bc;g of expression plasmids, 5 &#x003bc;g of reporter plasmid and 0.5 &#x003bc;g of CMV or SV-40 &#x003b2;-galactosidase plasmid. Electroporation of CHO cells was performed at 360 V and 950 microfarads (&#x003bc;F) (Gene Pulser XL, Bio-Rad) and C3H10T1/2 cells at 340 V and 950 &#x003bc;F. LS-8 cells were transfected by electroporation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h in 60 mm culture dishes and fed with 5% FBS and DMEM and then lysed and assayed for reporter activities and protein content by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase was measured using reagents from Promega. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase was measured using the Galacto-Light Plus reagents (Tropix Inc.). All luciferase activities were normalized to &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins</title><p><italic>Lef-1</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic> were PCR amplified from cDNA clones as described and ligated into the pGex6P-2 GST vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). <italic>Dlx2</italic> was PCR amplified and cloned into the pGex6P-2 GST vector using BamHI and NotI restriction enzyme sites engineered into the primers. Lef-1 and Lef-1 deletion fragments were PCR amplified using primers with specific restriction endonuclease sites, digested and cloned into the GST digested vector. All pGex6P-2 GST plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were transformed into BL21 cells. Proteins were isolated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Proteins were cleaved from the GST moiety using 80 U of PreScission Protease (Pharmacia Biotech) per ml of glutathione Sepharose. Cleaved proteins were stored in 10% glycerol. Protein concentration was quantitated with Bradford Reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Proteins were examined by electrophoresis on denaturing SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels, followed by Coomassie Blue staining (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid and 0.5% coomassie brilliant blue stain).</p></sec><sec><title>GST pull-down assays</title><p>Immobilized GST-Dlx2, GST-PITX2 and GST-Lef-1 fusion proteins were prepared as described above and suspended in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, with or without 1% milk and 400 &#x003bc;g/ml of ethidium bromide). Purified bacteria expressed Lef-1 proteins (50&#x02013;200 ng's) were added to 5 &#x003bc;g's immobilized GST&#x02013;Dlx2 fusion proteins or GST in a total volume of 100 &#x003bc;l and incubated for 30 m at 4&#x000b0;C. The beads were pelleted and washed 4 times with 200 &#x003bc;l binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and separated on a 10% SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel. Approximately, 80 ng of purified Lef-1 proteins were analyzed in separate western blots. Following SDS gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to PVDF filters (Millipore), immunoblotted and detected using appropriate antibodies, Lef-1, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Upstate), Dlx2 goat polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL reagents from Amersham.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation assay</title><p>Approximately 24 h after cell transfection with Dlx2 and Lef-1 &#x00394;N113, CHO cells were rinsed with 1 ml of PBS, then incubated with 1 ml ice cold RIPA buffer for 15 m at 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were harvested and disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 25-gauge needle attached to a 1 ml syringe. The lysates were then incubated on ice for 30 m. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10&#x02009;000&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 m at 4&#x000b0;C. An aliquot of lysate was saved for analysis as input control. Supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml microfuge tube on ice and precleared using the Preclearing Matrix B-goat (ExactaCruz B, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 m at 4&#x000b0;C. Matrix was removed by brief centrifugation and supernatant transferred to a new tube. An IP antibody-IP matrix complex was prepared as per manufacturer's instructions using primary anti-Dlx2 (25 &#x003bc;l) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The IP antibody-IP matrix complex was incubated with the precleared cell lysate at 4&#x000b0;C for 12 h. After incubation the lysate was centrifuged to pellet the IP matrix. The matrix was washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 15 &#x003bc;l of ddH2O and 3 &#x003bc;l 6&#x000d7; SDS loading dye. Samples were boiled for 5 m and resolved on a 10% polyacylamide gel.

To demonstrate Dlx2 binding to these sites, an EMSA was performed using purified Dlx2 protein and a probe derived from the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter containing a <italic>Dlx2</italic> binding site, &#x02212;260 to &#x02212;265 bp (TAGTTG). Dlx2 protein was added to the probe at 60, 120 and 180 ng and two bands were detected that were not in the probe alone lane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These bands increased in intensity with increasing Dlx2 protein and the slower migrating band appears to be a homodimer of Dlx2. Specificity of the complexes was demonstrated using 50-fold excess cold competitor probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Specificity of Dlx2 binding was further demonstrated using Dlx2 antisera and 180 ng of Dlx2 protein. The antisera reduced Dlx2 binding to the probe and both band intensities were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To determine if Msx2 and Dlx2 compete for binding to the probe, 180 ng of Dlx2 was incubated with 120 and 180 ng of Msx2. Msx2 bound as three bands, which increase in intensity with increasing amounts of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the binding of both Dlx2 and Msx2 decreased when both proteins were present in the binding reaction, demonstrating a competition for the DNA-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The pure Msx2 protein used in the binding studies is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The pure Dlx2 protein used in the EMSA experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> identified with the Dlx2 Ab on a western blot. Endogenous Dlx2 was observed in the tooth epithelial cell line LS-8, the pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cell line and the CHO cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Dlx2 appears to be highly expressed in CHO cells but is also seen in the other two cell lines. We next determined if Msx2 was expressed in these cell lines and found similar levels of endogenous Msx2 expression in the three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Lef-1 expression was observed in all three cell lysates, however only LS-8 and 10T1/2 cells express the larger molecular weight isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>ChIP analyses were done to demonstrate Dlx2 binding to the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter in the cell chromatin because these three cell lines endogenously express Dlx2 and Msx2. A sense primer and an anti-sense primer, which flank the Dlx2 binding site located at &#x02212;260 to &#x02212;265 in the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter, were designed and produce a 272 bp product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The sense primer anneals to the sequence located at &#x02212;268 to &#x02212;285 and the anitsense primer at &#x02212;13 to &#x02212;29 of the Msx2 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The Dlx2 binding site selected for the ChIP assay is identical to the EMSA probe sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Chromatin isolated from cells prior to immunoprecipitation served as a control; a sample without treatment of Dlx2 antibody was used as input control template and the primers were used to demonstrate the presence of chromatin in the sample. The primer set amplified the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter from chromatin input derived from the CHO cell line (lane 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A PCR was performed without chromatin and primers only as a negative control (lane 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Endogenous Dlx2 is bound to the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> as shown using Dlx2 antibody and Msx2 primers (lane 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Normal rabbit IgG was used as a control and did not immunoprecipitate the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter (lane 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, using primers to an unrelated gene did not amplify a product from the Dlx2 antibody immunoprecipitated chromatin (lane 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Lane 1 contains 1 Kb ladder (Promega) to confirm sizes of the PCR products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Because Lef-1 is endogenously expressed in many cell lines, the ChIP assay was used to determine if Lef-1 bound to the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter. Lef-1 is endogenously expressed in the LS-8 cell line and the Lef-1 Ab immunoprecipitates the Lef-1/chromatin complex containing the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter (lane 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The Msx2-5820 Luc promoter contains 5.8 Kb of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter and has &#x0223c;12 consensus (TAATTA) and non-consensus <italic>Dlx2</italic> binding sites (TAGTTG, TATTTG). Two truncated <italic>Msx2</italic> promoters were constructed; Msx2-872 Luc contains 872 bp of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter and three Dlx2 binding sites and Msx2-238 Luc, which does not contain Dlx2 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Dlx2 activated the full-length <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter at &#x0223c;20-fold in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, Dlx2 activated the truncated Msx2-872 promoter at higher levels (&#x0223c;30-fold) compared to the full-length promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results may indicate the presence of other factors binding to upstream <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter sequences that attenuate Dlx2 activation. However, Dlx2 did not activate the minimal Msx2-238 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Because <italic>Lef-1</italic> is co-expressed with <italic>Dlx2</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic> in several tissues, we asked if Lef-1 could activate the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter. In these experiments we used the alternatively spliced Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 construct, which does not contain the &#x003b2;BD in its N-terminus. This naturally occurring <italic>Lef-1</italic> transcript was used in order to eliminate the effect of &#x003b2;-catenin activating Lef-1. Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 alone did not activate the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoters however, co-transfection with Dlx2 resulted in a 33-fold synergistic activation of the Msx2-5820 promoter and 62-fold activation of the Msx2-872 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The Msx2-238 minimal promoter was activated at &#x0223c;5-fold by Dlx2 and Lef-1 &#x00394;N113, due to the presence of the Lef-1 binding site in this promoter construct. There is no difference in the synergistic activation of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter between the Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 or Lef-1 FL (full length) constructs (see Figure 8).</p><p>These experiments were repeated in the pluripotent C3H10T1/2 embryonic cell line. Transfection of these cells with the same constructs reveal similar results as with the CHO cells indicating activity in CHO cells was not cell specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Dlx2 activation and synergism with Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 was similar to that observed in CHO cells. The combination of this data and the ChIP assay demonstrate specific regulation of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter by Dlx2 and a synergy between Dlx2 and Lef-1. Furthermore, these experiments were performed in the LS-8 tooth epithelial cell line. The activation levels were decreased however, the relative activation of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter by Dlx2 and Lef-1 were similar (Figure 11B).</p></sec><sec><title>Dlx2 and Lef-1 physically interact</title><p>The finding that Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 alone did not activate the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter but synergized with Dlx2 suggested a physical interaction between Dlx2 and Lef-1 independent of &#x003b2;-catenin. A GST-pull-down assay was performed using immobilized GST-Dlx2 on Sepharose beads and incubated with pure Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 protein under stringent binding conditions. As a control, GST-beads alone did not bind Lef-1 &#x00394;N113, however, Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 bound to GST-Dlx2 demonstrating a direct protein interaction between these two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Previously shown to interact with Lef-1, immobilized GST-PITX2 was used as a positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Lef-1 binds to both proteins at similar levels. The binding of Lef-1 &#x00394;N113, a smaller native transcript, indicates that its interaction with Dlx2 does not require the &#x003b2;DB or the N-terminus.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate Dlx2 and Lef-1 protein interactions. CHO cells co-transfected with Dlx2 and Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 were assayed using the Dlx2 antibody to immunoprecipitate a Dlx2/Lef-1 complex. The immunoprecipitation experiments reveal a Dlx2 interaction with Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 (lane 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Because CHO cells do not express the larger molecular weight Lef-1 proteins but do express Dlx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), a small amount of Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 is immunoprecipitated in the Lef-1 only transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lane 2). As controls, empty vector and Dlx2 transfection did not immunoprecipitate Lef-1. Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 expression is shown in transfected CHO cell lysates (10% input) and also seen when co-transfected with Dlx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 8 and 9). Mock and Dlx2 input lanes were used as controls with the Lef-1 antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>The Lef-1 CAD domain and 3&#x02032; flanking residues are required for synergism with Dlx2</title><p>We have shown that an alternative endogenous Lef-1 transcript (Lef-1 &#x00394;N113) containing the context-dependent activation domain (CAD) and HMG domain while lacking the &#x003b2;BD interacts with Dlx2 and synergistically activates the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">C</xref>). In CHO cells, Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 co-transfected with Dlx2 synergistically activates the Msx2-5820 full-length promoter at &#x0223c;40-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The full-length Lef-1 cDNA containing the &#x003b2;BD activated the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter at &#x0223c;6-fold and co-expression of Dlx2 synergistically activated the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter at &#x0223c;40-fold in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Similar activation was observed in C3H10T1/2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, the &#x003b2;BD is not required for the Lef-1 synergistic activation with Dlx2. Deletion of 295 residues from the Lef-1 N-terminus (Lef-1 &#x00394;N295), which removes the CAD domain and leaves most of the HMG domain intact, results in a loss of synergism in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and C3H10T1/2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These results suggest that the HMG domain alone is not sufficient for synergistic activation of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter with Dlx2. Further truncation of the Lef-1 N-terminus deleting most of the HMG domain (Lef-1 &#x00394;N363) resulted in a loss of synergism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">C</xref>). These results demonstrate that the CAD domain is required for Lef-1 activation and/or synergism with Dlx2. In contrast, deleting part or most of the HMG domain, Lef-1 &#x00394;C34 or Lef-1 &#x00394;C102 results in low activity alone (&#x0223c;3-fold) and synergism with Dlx2 in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">C</xref>). The Lef-1 &#x00394;C34 and Lef-1 &#x00394;C102 constructs contain the CAD domain including 70 residues between the CAD and HMG domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) that are necessary for synergism with Dlx2.</p></sec><sec><title>Dlx2 interacts with the CAD and HMG domains of Lef-1</title><p>To determine specific regions of Lef-1 that interact with Dlx2, GST-pull-down experiments were performed using immobilized Lef-1 deletion constructs and purified Dlx2 protein. The Lef-1 constructs are identical to those used in the transfection experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We have previously shown that the naturally occurring smaller Lef-1 protein, Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 is sufficient for binding Dlx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, Dlx2 can directly interact with the HMG domain and the C-terminal portion of the HMG domain, GST-Lef-1 &#x00394;N295 and GST-Lef-1 &#x00394;N363, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). There is no reduction in binding compared to the GST-Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 construct of these two N-terminal deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). We were surprised to observe Dlx2 binding to Lef-1 &#x00394;N363, as this is only a 34 amino acid peptide; however Dlx2 binding to this construct was observed in repeated experiments and at similar levels compared to wild type Lef-1. We term this C-terminal Dlx2 interaction region as Dlx2 binding domain (BD) #2. Deletion of the Lef-1 C-terminal region, which lacks the 34 amino acid sequence (GST-Lef-1 &#x00394;C34) and GST-Lef-1 &#x00394;C102, which lacks most of the HMG domain, bind Dlx2 at levels similar to wild type Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). These data suggest that Dlx2 can bind to the CAD domain and/or the 70 residues that flank the CAD domain, termed Dlx2 BD #1. GST-beads do not bind Dlx2 as a control. Thus, Dlx2 may bind to several regions on Lef-1 or contact several residues of each region simultaneously. Further experiments will determine the exact binding sites and residues involved in the binding of each protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Msx2 auto-regulation and attenuation of Dlx2 activation</title><p>Because the DNA-binding elements of Dlx2 and Msx2 are similar, we asked if Msx2 could regulate its promoter. Transfection of Msx2 in CHO cells resulted in a 3- to 4-fold repression of both the Msx2-5820 and Msx2-872 promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). These results demonstrate auto-regulation by this well-known repressor protein. Msx2 and Dlx2 directly interact to regulate their activities through protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). However, they have not been shown to functionally regulate the Msx2 promoter. Because <italic>Msx2</italic> and <italic>Dlx2</italic> are co-expressed in similar tissues during development as well as in the CHO cells, can they antagonize each other? Equal expression of both factors revealed a decrease in Dlx2 activation of the full-length <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter from 20- to 5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Repression of Dlx2 activation was also observed with the Msx2-872 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). To determine if these activities were cell dependent, transfections were performed in C3H10T1/2 cells. No major differences were observed between these two different cell lines albeit a modest decrease in overall activation in the C3H10T1/2 cell line compared to the CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).</p><p>Msx2 repression of Dlx2 activation is dose-responsive and independent of Lef-1. Msx2 plasmid was titrated in CHO cells transfected with 2.5 &#x003bc;g of Dlx2 and Lef-1 FL or Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). The synergistic activation of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter by Dlx2 and Lef-1 FL was decreased from &#x0223c;38-fold without Msx2 to 28-fold (1.25 &#x003bc;g Msx2), 17-fold (2.5 &#x003bc;g Msx2) and 9-fold (3.75 &#x003bc;g Msx2). Interestingly, Msx2 repression of the synergistic activation by Dlx2 and the shorter Lef-1 isoform (Lef-1 &#x00394;N113) was increased compared to Lef-1 FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Dlx2 and Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 synergistically activate the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter at &#x0223c;38-fold; addition of 1.25 &#x003bc;g Msx2 repressed the activation to 13-fold, 2.5 &#x003bc;g Msx2 to 6-fold and 3.75 &#x003bc;g Msx2 to 5-fold in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>. The same experiment was repeated in the LS-8 tooth epithelial cell line. These cells demonstrate the synergistic activation of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter by Dlx2 and Lef-1 FL or Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Msx2 represses the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter &#x0223c;3-fold as shown in CHO cells. Furthermore, a similar decrease in synergistic activation by Dlx2 and Lef-1 in LS-8 cells was observed by Msx2 titration as shown in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Together these data demonstrate that Msx2 can negatively auto-regulate its promoter and repress Dlx2 activation through direct binding to a common site or a physical interaction between the two proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Several factors and molecules regulating <italic>Msx2</italic> expression have been identified including signaling molecules, hormones and transcription factors. The FGF and BMP signaling molecules are involved in the differential regulation of <italic>Msx</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). BMP-dependent activation of Msx2 can be mediated through the cooperative binding of Smad4 and Lef-1; Lef-1 can synergize with Smad4 and Smad1 to activate the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Furthermore, Lef-1 synergizes with BMP2 to activate <italic>Msx2</italic> expression. In contrast, YY1, a zinc finger transcription factor, can activate <italic>Msx2</italic> independent of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>).

Pax3 has been shown to bind to the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter and represses <italic>Msx2</italic> expression in the murine cardiac neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Genetic analysis suggests that Fox1 is required for BMP-dependent activation of <italic>Msx2</italic> in calvarial tissues of mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>).

While BMP signaling plays a major role in <italic>Msx2</italic> expression patterns during tooth development, little is known about the role and mechanisms of transcription factors regulating <italic>Msx2</italic> expression in the developing tooth.</p><sec><title>Dlx2 regulates the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter</title><p>ChIP assays identified Dlx2 binding to the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and co-transfection of Dlx2 with the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter reveals a direct activation by Dlx2. This transcriptional mechanism coincides with the distinct expression pattern of these two transcription factors during tooth development. <italic>Dlx2</italic> is expressed initially in both the dental mesenchyme and epithelium and high expression is observed in the epithelial tissue at later stages. <italic>Msx2</italic> expression occurs &#x0223c;1 day after <italic>Dlx2</italic> expression in the epithelium, which would correspond to its potential activation by Dlx2 in this tissue. There is also overlapping expression patterns of Msx2 and Dlx2 in the first two branchial arches and the AER where Msx2 and Dlx2 overlap in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>Dlx2 binds to the Msx2 promoter as a monomer and possible homodimer as shown by the EMSA and correlates with the homodimerization revealed in previous GST-pull-down experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies have shown Dlx2 binding to the TAATTG sequence as multiple bands suggesting the presence of dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). There are approximately 12 Dlx2 binding sites in the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter including the proximal site in which the ChIP assay revealed Dlx2 binding was a non-consensus 5&#x02032;-TAGTTG-3&#x02032; compared to the consensus 5&#x02032;-TAATTG-3&#x02032; element. A previous report using ChIP analyses has shown that the 5&#x02032;-TAATTA-3&#x02032; sequence was required for Dlx2 DNA-binding and activation in the Dlx5/Dlx6 intergenic enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). A consensus site for Xenopus Dlx3 was identified as (A/C/G)TAATT(G/A)(C/G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). The core is a TAAT motif, which is observed in many homeodomain DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). However, the 3&#x02032; dinucleotide confers specificity to the binding of these factors. Our data demonstrate that perturbations in the core TAAT can be recognized by the Dlx2 homeodomain protein and activate the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter. However, there is a TAATCA sequence overlapping the TAGTTG element in the anti-sense strand. It may be possible for Dlx2 to bind to this region. Similarly, we have previously reported on the promiscuity of the Msx2 protein binding to non-consensus elements and regulating promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Our results further demonstrate the ability of Msx2 to bind to the non-consensus TAGTTG element recognized by Dlx2 in the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Dlx2 directly interacts with Lef-1 to regulate <italic>Msx2</italic></title><p>The Lef-1 FL construct minimally activates the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter at &#x0223c;6-fold and the alternative Lef-1 transcript, Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 cannot activate the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter, however both can complex with Dlx2 to synergistically activate <italic>Msx2</italic>.</p><p>We specifically utilized the smaller native <italic>Lef-1</italic> transcript (Lef-1 &#x00394;N113) to dissociate the effects of &#x003b2;-catenin on Lef-1 interactions with Dlx2. <italic>Lef-1</italic> transcripts can arise through alternative splicing and different promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). A recent report describes the use of an internal ribosome entry site that mediates the translation of a full-length <italic>Lef-1</italic> transcript. The full-length <italic>Lef-1</italic> (<italic>Lef-1</italic> FL) transcript contains a large 5&#x02032;UTR synthesized using a separate PI promoter and utilizes a cap-independent mechanism for translation of the full-length Lef-1, containing the &#x003b2;BD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). This isoform has been termed growth promoting because it is expressed during cell growth in undifferentiated, mitotically active cells. This Lef-1 activity is countered by the expression of a truncated Lef-1 protein that lacks the &#x003b2;BD and can compete for binding to Wnt target genes. The shorter Lef-1 isoform is produced from a second P2 promoter located in the second intron of the <italic>LEF-1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). This shorter <italic>Lef-1</italic> transcript (Lef-1 &#x00394;N113) could act as an inhibitory isoform due to its ability to interact with co-factors interacting with Lef-1 FL as well as compete for DNA-binding sites and thus been termed growth suppressing. Interestingly, in colon cancer cells only the <italic>LEF-1</italic> FL transcript is produced and the loss of balance between the long and short forms may effect cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>).</p><p>It is well known that Lef-1 requires other factors to become transcriptional active. In response to Wnt signals, &#x003b2;-catenin is stabilized and interacts with the N-terminus of Lef-1 to activate transcription of Wnt-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). A previous report has demonstrated that Lef-1 can synergize with Smad4 to activate the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). This activation was independent of BMP signaling and was in response to &#x003b2;-catenin activation. Recently, we demonstrated a role for Lef-1, &#x003b2;-catenin and PITX2 in regulating the <italic>LEF-1</italic> promoter suggesting a role for &#x003b2;-catenin in regulating Dlx2 and Lef-1 regulation of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter. Without Wnt signaling, Lef-1 can interact with the co-repressor Groucho to repress Wnt-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). We have previously identified a Lef-1 interaction with the homeodomain transcription factor PITX2 to synergistically regulate the <italic>LEF-1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). In this report we demonstrate that both the Lef-1 Fl and Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 proteins can interact with Dlx2 and that the &#x003b2;BD has no effect on this interaction.

The CAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) and a region flanking the CAD are required for association with the Groucho corepressor and HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>). The C-terminal HMG domain is involved in DNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>) and two regions within the HMG domain mediate the interaction with Smad factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>). Two regions of Lef-1 were found to interact with Smad3 in the HMG domain. One site mapped to residues 324&#x02013;334 while another site was localized to a lysine- and arginine-rich region between residues 370 and 383 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>). These two regions bind to the MH2 and MH1 domains of Smad3, respectively. Our data suggests two regions of Lef-1 interact with Dlx2; the C-terminal region of the HMG domain containing 30 amino acids (Lef-1 &#x00394;N363), which corresponds to the Smad3 MH1 binding domain and a second region containing the CAD and flanking sequences (Lef-1 &#x00394;N113-&#x00394;C102). These regions may be involved in the interactions with other factors, such as Smad3. Thus Dlx2 binding to Lef-1 could have an impact on the overall activity of Lef-1 protein. Competition between factors for these sites, could possibly add to the complexity of Lef-1 transcriptional activity. We are currently investigating the role of &#x003b2;-catenin in regulating the Dlx2/Lef-1 transcription complex by fine mapping the interaction sites.</p></sec><sec><title>An Msx2 feedback regulatory mechanism</title><p>Msx2 is a homeodomain transcription factor required for the development of several tissues and processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Msx2 is a transcriptional repressor and can interact with other factors to regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>). These effects can occur through their interactions with other factors without binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>).</p><p>Our data has shown that Msx2 can negatively regulate its promoter. We have previously demonstrated Msx2 binding to the TAATTG sequence with high affinity, which is shared by Dlx2. However, Msx2 binding appears to be somewhat promiscuous by binding to other homeodomain transcription factor elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). We have previously reported that Msx2 and PITX2 can bind to the <italic>Dlx2</italic> promoter bicoid elements (consensus PITX2 binding elements) independent of one another and the levels of binding are based on the relative amount of each protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). In this report we demonstrate that Msx2 competes with Dlx2 for binding to the TAGTTG element in the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter. Msx2 bound to this element as three bands, which is similar to Msx2 binding to the consensus TAATTG element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Msx1 and Dlx2 demonstrate mutual exclusive DNA-binding and we show that Msx2 competes with Dlx2 for DNA-binding sites on the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter in a similar fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Furthermore, Msx2 physically interacts with Dlx2, which may inhibit Dlx2 transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Our data demonstrates a reduction in DNA-binding by both Dlx2 and Msx2 when incubated together in the EMSA experiment. This would be expected as both proteins can directly interact and inhibit the DNA-binding activity of the other protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The activity of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter would be differentially regulated as the level of these two proteins change during development. Such as during tooth development, the level of <italic>Msx2</italic> expression is initially high immediately after <italic>Dlx2</italic> and <italic>Lef-1</italic> expression (cap stage), restricted during the tooth bell stage, expressed at later stages and during amelogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>). Moreover, Msx and Dlx proteins have been shown to bind identical elements on the GnRH promoter resulting in functional antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>); Msx2 and Dlx5 on the osteocalcin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>); and Pax3 and Msx1 on the MyoD promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>).</p><p>Based on the functional interaction between Dlx2 and Lef-1, the identification that Dlx2 binds the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and the transcriptional activation of the <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter in three cell types, we propose a model for the regulation of <italic>Msx2</italic> by these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Msx2 can negatively regulate its promoter and attenuate the activation by Dlx2. Thus, Dlx2 and Lef-1 interact to synergistically activate <italic>Msx2</italic>; Msx2 can attenuate Dlx2 activation or directly repress <italic>Msx2</italic> promoter activity. These interactions would regulate the spatial and temporal expression pattern of <italic>Msx2</italic> observed during development.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs Tord A.

Cells were harvested and lysed and the Lef-1/Dlx2 protein complex immunoprecipitated (IP) using the Dlx2 antibody. The immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF filter and western blotting was done using the Lef-1 antibody. Lane 1 is the Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 and Dlx2 co-transfected IP, lane 2 is the Lef-1 &#x00394;N113 transfected IP, lane 3 is the Dlx2 transfected IP, lane 4 is the mock-transfected cell lysate IP. Input controls are shown in lanes 6&#x02013;9. As a molecular weight size control, 150 ng of purified Lef-1 protein was immunoblotted (lane 5). The transfected Lef-1 migrates slightly slower due to the presence of a C-terminal Myc/His tag on the mammalian expression plasmids. Transfected Dlx2 is expressed in CHO cells and a representative lysate is shown in Figure 9C. Molecular weight markers are shown between lanes 4 and 5. Experiments were repeated more than three times.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl689f7"/></fig><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Identification of Lef-1 domains required for synergism with Dlx2.

In the present study, we demonstrated that in the presence of progesterone, protein inhibitor of activated STAT-3 (PIAS3) significantly inhibited the PR transcriptional activity and the expression of progesterone-responsive genes. Reduction of endogenous PIAS3 by PIAS3 small-interfering RNA enhanced PR transactivation in a ligand-dependent manner. PIAS3 interacted with PR both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and the interaction was enhanced by progesterone. Furthermore, our findings suggested that PIAS3 strongly induced PRB sumoylation at three sites, Lys-7, Lys-388 and Lys-531. In addition, novel roles in PRB nuclear retention and transactivation were identified for these sites. Our data also suggested that PIAS3 was recruited in a largely hormone-dependent manner in response to a progesterone-responsive promoter. Finally, we demonstrated that PIAS3 inhibited the DNA-binding activity of PR and influenced its nuclear export as well as PR transactivation. Taken together, these data strongly suggested that PIAS3 played an important physiological role in PR function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human progesterone receptor (PR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors and plays an important role in tissue development, reproduction and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Similar to other steroid receptors, PR also contains a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) located in the center and a C-terminal hormone-binding domain (HBD). In addition, PR contains a ligand-independent activation function (AF) domain, AF1, located in the N-terminus upstream of the DBD and a hormone-dependent domain, AF2, in the C-terminal HBD. The inhibitory function (IF) domain is flanked at AF1 N-terminus, which auto-inhibits the function of PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). PRs are expressed in two isoforms, PRA and PRB. The two isoforms of PR are identical in sequence except that PRA is missing the far 164 residues N-terminal B-upstream segment (BUS) region. This segment is the third AF domain, AF3, which contributes to the different transcription activities of PRA and PRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Consequently, PRB is in general a stronger transcription activator than PRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Similar to other steroid hormone receptors, PR is transcriptionally inactive and remains sequestered in a complex of heat-shock proteins in the absence of a ligand. Progestin binding to PR causes a conformational change and dimerization, resulting in the association of PR dimer with specific co-activators and general transcription factors. Ligand receptors then bind to DNA via specific progesterone response elements (PREs) located within the regulatory regions of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>Apart from specific ligand regulation, different types of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination, also regulate the steroid hormone receptors transcriptional activation and/or stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Recently, a new covalent modification of PR has been described: SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) modification. SUMO modification is accomplished by the reversible attachment of SUMO family members to the acceptor lysine residues located in the target proteins, similar to ubiquitination, with the help of a set of enzymes. Even if mechanistically similar to ubiquitination, the two processes involve distinct enzymes and sumoylation does not promote protein degradation. Sumoylation appears to regulate diverse cellular processes, including specification of the subcellular localization of proteins, formation of subnuclear structures, interactions between proteins, stability of proteins and modulation of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have reported that SUMO-1 regulates the hormone-induced transactivation of PR, since its overexpression promotes sumoylation of PRB at the site of Lys-388, and very strongly enhances PR-mediated gene transcription. However, the mutation of sumoylation site in the K388R mutant also increased PR transactivation. Although it has been speculated that the enhancement of PR transactivation by SUMO-1 overexpression may be realized by the sumoylation of the coactivator SRC-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), the molecular basis by which SUMO-1 regulates PR transcriptional capacity remains unknown and further studies are necessary to clarify the process.</p><p>Recently, a family of PIAS proteins was described as SUMO-E3 ligases for critical target proteins such as p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), c-jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), LEF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), androgen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) and estrogen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). However, it remains to be established whether PIAS3 was responsible for PR sumoylation. In the present study, we showed for the first time the pattern of PRB sumoylation at three sites was strongly induced by PIAS3. Overexpression of PIAS3 strongly inhibited the progesterone-triggered transactivation of PRB with different promoter or cells, and knockdown of endogenous PIAS3 with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) increased the PR transactivation. However, PIAS3 inhibited gene activation by ligand-stimulated PRB in a manner that was independent of PRB SUMO modification. Our results indicated that PIAS3 was recruited in a hormone-dependent manner to a progesterone-responsive promoter. Finally, we demonstrated that PIAS3 inhibited the DNA-binding activity of PR and influenced its nuclear export, which mechanistically resulted in PR transactivation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>PRA and PRB cDNA kindly provided by Professor O'Malley (Baylor College of Medicine) were cloned into pXJ40-Myc and pcDNA3.0-GAL4-DBD vectors.

HA-tagged PIAS3 C334S mutant was generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, where cysteine 334 was converted to serine. Myc-tagged PRB mutants (K388R, K7/531R and K7/388/531R) were generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, in them lysine 7, 388 and 531 were converted to arginine.

To further elucidate the influence of PIAS3 on PR-mediated gene transactivation, PR-negative 293T cells were transfected with PRB, a MMTV luciferase reporter containing PRE in the promoter and PIAS3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, PRB exhibited a 25-fold induction of reporter gene activation in response to progesterone. In addition, the ligand-dependent transactivation of PRB was strongly repressed, in a dose-dependent manner, by PIAS3 expression. The effects of PIAS3 on PRB transactivation were not restricted to a single cell type, as similar results were noted in COS7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). No differences were observed in PRB protein levels between 293T and COS7 cells containing transiently expressed PIAS3 and non-transfected controls (data not shown), suggesting that the inhibition of PRB transactivation by PIAS3 was not due to a modulation of PRB protein levels. Further examination of the transactivation of endogenous PR in PR-positive T47D breast cancer cells demonstrated that PIAS3 repressed progesterone-triggered reporter gene transcriptional activity by 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In order to elucidate whether PIAS3 inhibition of PR transactivation was dependent on ligand stimulation, 293T cells were co-transfected with PRB, PIAS3 and MMTV-Luc reporter then treated with antiprogestin, RU486 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The data suggested that, in the presence of progesterone, RU486 completely blocked the effects of PIAS3 on PRB transcriptional activity. The effect of PIAS3 on transactivation of PRA was also examined in HeLa cells, and PIAS3 had the similar inhibitory effect on PRA transactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>We further investigated whether the influence of PIAS3 on PR function was independent of the promoter construct, utilizing a Gal4&#x02013;PRB fusion protein and a reporter plasmid containing a Gal4-driven promoter. Similar to the MMTV promoter, PIAS3 repressed Gal4&#x02013;PRB transcriptional activity, but not Gal4&#x02013;DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results indicated that PIAS3 strongly repressed PR-dependent transactivation, regardless of the promoter or cell type.</p><p>In order to investigate the role of endogenous PIAS3 in PR-mediated transcriptional activation, 293T cells were transfected with siRNA directed against PIAS3, or a control siRNA, then co-transfected, 48 h later, with a MMTV luciferase reporter construct together with the PRB expression vector. Cells were then stimulated with progesterone (24 h). The results demonstrated that there was an obvious increase in ligand-mediated PRB activity in PIAS3 siRNA-transfected cells, compared to control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that the reduction of PIAS3 leads to increased ligand-mediated PRB activity. Western-blot analysis demonstrated that PIAS3 siRNA, but not control, specifically reduced the expression of endogenous PIAS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), further suggesting that PIAS3 inhibited PR transcriptional activity in the presence of progesterone.</p><p>Previous research has suggested that cyclin D1 played an important role in normal mammary gland development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).

In order to corroborate luciferase reporter assay data, the effects of PIAS3 on the expression of endogenous PR target genes were examined. T47D cells were transfected with PIAS3 in the presence and absence of progesterone (10 nM, 6 h) before harvesting; RNA was extracted, transcription of cyclin D1 was measured by real-time RT&#x02013;PCR and expression was normalized to GAPDH. Although cyclin D1 mRNA levels were upregulated in response to progesterone, with no changes noted in the absence of progesterone, PIAS3 overexpression reduced the ligand-induced increase in cyclin D1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data demonstrated PIAS3 efficiently decreased the expression of endogenous PR-responsive genes, suggesting that PIAS3 functioned as an inhibitor of PR-mediated transactivation.</p></sec><sec><title>PIAS3 physically interacted with PRB</title><p>To further investigate the mechanism by which PIAS3 inhibited PRB transactivation, we examined whether there was physical association between PRB and PIAS3. Although previous research suggested that steroid nuclear receptors physically interacted with PIAS family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), detailed data of PR interaction with PIAS3 was not presented. We utilized a GST pull-down assay to further elucidate the physical association between PRB and PIAS3 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our results demonstrated that the recombinant fusion protein glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase with PIAS3 (GST&#x02013;PIAS3), but not GST alone, was able to bind to PRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, we further verified the interaction between PRB and PIAS3 in intact cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A Myc-tagged PRB (Myc-PRB) was co-expressed with HA-tagged PIAS3 in 293T cells. Antibodies against the HA epitope precipitated a complex of PRB and PIAS3, suggesting that the two proteins physically interacted in living cells. Progesterone treatment significantly enhanced the association between PRB and PIAS3, as demonstrated by both GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, which was consistent with previous results that the inhibition of PRB transactivation by PIAS3 was only observed in cells stimulated with ligands.</p><p>In order to further identify the region of the PRB protein that binds to PIAS3, PRB and its deletions were cloned into a pGADT7 fusion protein expression vector then transformed into <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strain AH109, together with pGBKT7 plasmids encoding GAL4-BD fused to PIAS3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and D, the physical association between PRB and PIAS3 was observed in yeast two-hybrid assays, with amino acids 556&#x02013;642 determined to be essential for the association of PRB with PIAS3 in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PIAS3-induced sumoylation of PRB <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Recently, the PIAS protein family was described as SUMO-E3 ligases for critical target proteins such as p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), c-jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), LEF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), as well as the androgen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) and estrogen receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Although PIAS proteins were shown to act as regulators of PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), it has not been reported whether PIAS family proteins mediate the sumoylation of PR. In order to clarify whether the effects of PIAS3 on PR transactivation were associated with the SUMO modification of PR, 293T cells were transfected with a Myc-PRB expression vector in the absence or presence of a vector encoding HA-tagged SUMO-1. Blotting with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody detected a single protein band of &#x0223c;115 kDa in cells expressing only PRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of progesterone, cells co-expressing both PRB and SUMO-1 displayed an additional slower-migrating band representing the sumoylated PRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). An HA-SUMO-conjugated PRB band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) was detected, with an anti-HA antibody, at the same position on the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These data suggested that the band represented sumoylated PRB. Additional studies demonstrated that, compared with the wild-type control, the PRB K388R mutant was not sumoylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which suggests that PRB underwent sumoylation at Lys-388, located at its N-terminal domain.</p><p>To further investigate the role of PRB sumoylation, we performed transient transfection assays in 293T cells and found that SUMO-1 expression significantly increased PRB transactivation in the presence of progesterone (Supplementary Figure 1A). Furthermore, mutation of sumoylation site in the K388R mutant also increased the transactivation ability of PRB (Supplementary Figure 1B). The result that the non-sumoylated mutant was more active than the wild-type receptor was similar to that reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we investigated whether PIAS3 protein was capable of enhancing SUMO-1 attachment to PRB in intact cells by co-expressing Myc-PRB, HA-SUMO-1 and Flag-PIAS3 proteins in 293T cells, in the absence or presence of progesterone. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, in cells without co-expression of the PIAS3 protein, a single band representing SUMO-modified PRB was obviously enhanced by the addition of progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, three slower-migrating bands, representing sumoylated PRB, appeared with PIAS3 co-expression, and the band representing sumoylation of PRB in Lys-388 site was strongly enhanced with progesterone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Given that this result was based on overexpression of PIAS3, we examined whether endogenous PIAS3 was involved in the sumoylation of PRB. Knockdown of PIAS3 by RNAi decreased the level of PRB sumoylation in the presence of progesterone, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. PIASy, an alternative PIAS family member protein, only marginally enhanced PRB sumoylation in the presence of progesterone (Supplementary Figure 3), suggesting that PIAS3-promoted PRB sumoylation was specific.</p><p>This is, to our knowledge, the first report that, in the presence of progesterone, PIAS3 expression strongly induced a pattern of PRB sumoylation at three sites, including Lys-388 and two novel sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of PIAS3-induced PRB sumoylation sites</title><p>Mutagenesis studies were undertaken to further investigate the sumoylation sites of PRB mediated by PIAS3 <italic>in vivo</italic>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, substitution on Lys-388, including the K388R and K7/388/531/R mutants, abolished the ability of SUMO-1 conjugated to PRB, even when treated with progesterone. In contrast, the double substitution on Lys-7 and Lys-531 (K7/531R) did not abolish sumoylation at Lys-388, although it was slightly lessened, suggesting that mutations of Lys-7 and Lys-531 influenced Lys-388 sumoylation.</p><p>Ectopical expression of PIAS3 resulted in the strong enhancement of PRB sumoylation in the presence of progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Interestingly, sumoylation levels in the K7/531R mutant were strongly diminished compared to wild-type PRB, with only one band noted indicating Lys-388 sumoylation. The single band in the K7/531R mutant was similar to the band in the absence of PIAS3, which was relatively weaker than that in wild-type PRB and which was further abolished in the K7/388/531R. These results indicated that Lys-7 and Lys-531 were also involved in the PIAS3-mediated sumoylation of PRB. Notably, the ability of PIAS3 to stimulate PRB sumoylation was dependent on Lys-388 sumoylation.</p></sec><sec><title>PIAS3 inhibition of PRB transactivation was independent of PRB sumoylation</title><p>In order to further examine the role of PIAS3-enhanced sumoylation on PR transcription regulation, 293T cells were transfected with the same amount of PRB or its mutants (K388R or K7/531R or K7/388/531R) and treated, or not, with progesterone (10 nM, 24 h).

Intriguingly, with the double substitution on both Lys-7 and Lys-531, the activation of the reporter gene mediated by K7/531R mutant was significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, the K7/388/531/R mutant almost failed to be transcriptionally activated by progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) whereas the protein levels of PR and its mutants in 293T cells were quite similar (data not shown). We then examined the ability of PIAS3 to inhibit gene activation mediated by mutants unable to be modified by SUMO-1. To this end, 293T cells were co-transfected with PRB or its mutants (K388R, K7/531R or K7/388/531R), the pMMTV-Luc reporter construct, and equal amounts of PIAS3 expression vector. Cell lysates were prepared for luciferase assays 24 h after progesterone treatment. Surprisingly, the assays revealed that the transactivation of these mutants, without sumoylation, was still inhibited by PIAS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Most significantly, the inhibition levels were comparable with those observed in the wild-type PRB. In addition, all PRB mutants still interacted with PIAS3 in the presence of progesterone (Supplementary Figure 4).</p><p>We further investigated whether the PIAS3 C334S mutant lacking E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) was able to inhibit PRB transactivation as well as the wild-type. Similar to previous assays, 293T cells were co-transfected with PRB, SUMO-1, PIAS3 or PIAS3 C334S mutant then treated with or without progesterone. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the PIAS3 C334S mutant lost the ability to enhance PRB sumoylation in the presence of progesterone, whereas PIAS3 inhibited the transcriptional activity of PRB in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), with comparable capacity displayed by the C334S mutant.

Confocal microscopy data indicated that both wild-type PRB and its mutants predominantly resided in the nucleus, with some cytoplasmic staining noted in the absence of progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, a&#x02013;d</xref>). However, 2 h after progesterone treatment, the wild-type PRB was completely translocated into the nucleus, but excluded from nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, a and F</xref>). Although a similar distribution pattern was observed with the PRB K388R mutant after treatment with progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, b and F</xref>), &#x0003e;60% of the PRB K7/388/531R mutant was still localized to the cytoplasm in the ligand-treated HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, d and F</xref>), and &#x0223c;40% of the PRB K7/531R mutant staining was also cytoplasmic, in the presence of progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, c and F</xref>). These results suggested that the localization of PRB K7/531R and K7/388/531R differed from that of wild-type PRB, and were consistent with the ligand-stimulated transactivation of PRB and its mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These data also suggested that the three arginine substitutions on Lys-7, Lys-388 and Lys-531 might have caused a conformational change in PR, resulting in the inability of the mutant to translocate to the nucleus in response to ligand stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>PIAS3 destabilized PRB retention in the nucleus</title><p>Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to visualize the subcellular localization of endogenous PR and PIAS3 in T47D cells treated, or not, with progesterone (2 h, 100 nM).

Progesterone treatment resulted in the complete translocation of liganded-PRB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Detection of Myc-tagged PRB with an anti-Myc antibody yielded the same localization as endogenous PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). PIAS3 resided mainly in the nucleus, as dotted structures, with no changes induced by progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

GFP-tagged PIAS3 expression was also observed as nuclear dots. Although Myc-PRB mainly resided in the nucleus, some cytoplasmic staining was noted, which did not change as a result of ectopical expression of PIAS3 in the absence of progesterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, 0 h). After 30 min of progesterone treatment, &#x0003e;85% of PRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) translocated to the nucleus, and co-localized with PIAS3 as nuclear dot structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, after 60 min of progesterone treatment, some PRB staining was noted in the cytoplasm of cells co-transfected with PIAS3, compared with cells, which only expressed PRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Similar results were also found in the PIAS3 C334S mutant, which lost the SUMO-E3-ligase ability (Supplementary Figure 5). These data suggested that, in the presence of progesterone, PIAS3 influenced the localization of PRB and that one of the mechanisms by which PIAS3 inhibited PR transcriptional activity was by promoting the nuclear export of PR.</p></sec><sec><title>PIAS3 is recruited to endogenous PR-responsive promoters</title><p>To further understand the mechanisms by which PIAS3 inhibited PRB transactivation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to determine whether PIAS3 and PRB were recruited to promoters of progesterone-regulated genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. HEK-293 cells, stably expressing the MMTV promoter, were transfected with Myc-PRB or HA-PIAS3, then treated, or not, with progesterone (100 nM, 2 h). Previous research demonstrated that the MMTV promoter was highly inducible by progesterone and contained multiple GRE/PREs, located between 190 and 80 bp from the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Following formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin precipitation with anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies, the precipitated DNA was PCR amplified with specific primers flanking the PRE in the PR enhancer region. In the absence of hormone, ChIP assay detected minimal occupancy of the MMTV promoter by PRB, as well as non-specific IgG background, whereas progesterone treatment resulted in a substantial increase of PRB recruitment by the MMTV promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). At the same time, PIAS3 also associated with the MMTV promoter in the presence of hormone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Both PIAS3 and PRB were specifically co-immunoprecipitated with HA- and Myc-specific antibodies, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, HEK-293 cells stably expressing the MMTV promoter were co-transfected with Myc-PRB and HA-PIAS3, then treated, 24 h after transfection, with progesterone for various times points. As expected, PRB displayed a clear time-dependent recruitment to the MMTV promoter. Importantly, PIAS3 also revealed a distinct time-dependent recruitment to the MMTV promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Moreover, our results showed that, in the presence of progesterone, PIAS3 expression strongly induced a pattern of PRB sumoylation at three distinct sites. We further provided evidence that PIAS3 inhibited the DNA-binding activity of PRB and promoted its nuclear export.</p><sec><title>Influence of PIAS3 on PRB transactivation and sumoylation</title><p>There have been diverse reports on the influence of the PIAS protein family on steroid receptor function. Kotaja <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) reported that while all PIAS proteins were able to co-activate PR-dependent transcription, the degree of activation was dependent on the receptor, the promoter and the cell type. However, it was of note that with a more complex promoter (the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, pMMTV), Tan <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) found PIAS1 repressed PR-dependent transactivation. Controversial results of the effects of PIAS family proteins on steroid receptors might have resulted from the fact that these studies used different promoter constructs and cell types to measure transcriptional activity. Our findings, utilizing promoters of pMMTV-Luc and GAL4-Luc reporters, consistently indicated that PIAS3 strongly inhibited PR-mediated transactivation in 293T, HeLa, T47D and COS7 cells.</p><p>Sumoylation has emerged as an important mechanism of gene expression control. Studies on a number of SUMO targeted transcription factors revealed that steroid receptors underwent sumoylation in response to ligand stimuli, which involved the regulation of transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>), including AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). On the other hand, PIAS family proteins were described as SUMO-E3 ligases for critical target proteins, such as p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), LEF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), androgen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) and estrogen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). However, it remains to be established whether PIAS3 was responsible for PR sumoylation while inhibiting its transactivation. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that co-expression of PIAS3 strongly increased the sumoylation of PRB in the presence of progesterone.</p><p>Interestingly, SUMO-1 modification appears to have inconsistent effects on the transcriptional activity of PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Abdel-Hafiz <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) demonstrated that SUMO-1 modification repressed PR transcriptional activity, identifying the consensus SUMO-1 binding motif as <sup>387</sup>IKEE, within the IF domain of PR. In contrast, SUMO-1 overexpression markedly enhanced PR-mediated gene transcription. The controversial results were partly due to the fact that SUMO-1 also exerted effects on other proteins involved in PR transcription regulation, such as SRC-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). However, our findings clearly indicated that PIAS3-induced SUMO modification did not involve in the repression of PR transcriptional activity by PIAS3, as the PRB K388R and K7/388/531R mutants, lacking sumoylation ability, were still repressed by PIAS3. Moreover, the PIAS3 C334S mutant, lacking SUMO-E3-ligase activity, still repressed PR transcriptional activity. These findings clearly indicated that the PIAS3 protein inhibited PR transactivation through a mechanism that was independent of SUMO modification of PR. Similar mechanisms have also been reported with the regulation of other transcription factors by PIAS proteins, including p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>), STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>), ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), LEF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) and Elk-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Whereas SUMO-E3-ligase activity of PIAS1 and PIASx-&#x003b1; might be important for the regulation of androgen receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), but in the current study, PIAS3-induced sumoylation had no effect on PR activity, suggesting that PIAS proteins regulated the activity of transcription factors through different mechanisms more than just SUMO-E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SUMO modification increased PRB stability</title><p>Although a relationship between SUMO modification of PR and PIAS3-mediated inhibition of its transcriptional activity was not demonstrated, our findings established a pattern of PRB sumoylation that was strongly induced by PIAS3, and identified the positions of SUMO modification at three distinct sites. PRB sumoylation is known to occur on Lys-388 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). We found that PIAS3 also induced PRB sumoylation at other two sites, Lys-7 and Lys-531, which reside in a motif that partially fits the &#x003a8;KXE consensus sumoylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Our data demonstrated that the double mutant (K7/531R) had only one slower-migrating band, corresponding to SUMO-modified PRB at Lys-388, which was much weaker than that in wild-type PRB, whereas the K7/388/531R completely eliminated PRB sumoylation in the presence of PIAS3 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Intriguingly, in the presence of PIAS3, the K388R mutant abrogated PRB sumoylation at the two additional sites. These results indicated that PRB sumoylation at these sites might occur in a sequential fashion as mutation of Lys-388 blocked the sumoylation of Lys-7 and Lys-531. Similar findings were reported with the NFAT1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, our findings identified previously unexpected roles for Lys-7 and Lys-531 in the transcriptional activity and nuclear retention of PRB. Although the ligand-triggered translocation of PRB into nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) was still observed in the K388R mutant lacking sumoylation ability, the K7/388/531R mutant failed to translocate in response to progesterone stimulation. Moreover, it fitted well with the impaired transactivation capacity and the K7/388/531R mutant was no longer activated by ligand. Our results suggested that mutants were still able to dimerize in the presence of progesterone (Supplementary Figure 2), which contributed to the nuclear localization of PR. This may have resulted from the fact that the substitution of the three lysine sites with arginine influenced PR dimensional conformation. The results suggested that Lys-388, Lys-7 and Lys-531 were important for the ligand-triggered transactivation of PRB.</p><p>Our findings provided insights that allowed us to speculate on the role of SUMO modification of PRB.

Moreover, PRB mutants, with no sumoylation ability, were shown to be resistant to progesterone-induced degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome (data not shown), suggesting that SUMO-1 and ubiquitin compete for conjugation to the same lysines in PRB.

Our results showed that the interaction between PRB and PIAS3 protein destabilized PRB nuclear localization. It was noted that PRB translocation to the nucleus seemed to be markedly inhibited by the interaction with PIAS3 after progesterone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, evaluation of PRB and PIAS3 using confocal microscopy showed that within a short time period (0.5 h) PRB completely entered the nucleus, while at a later time point (2 h) PRB was partly cytosolic. Interestingly, co-localization of PR and PIAS3 was observed predominantly in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These data suggested it was unlikely that PIAS3 inhibited PRB translocation to the nucleus, but rather destabilized PRB retention in the nucleus. The results might explain, at least in part, the strong inhibition of PR transcriptional activity by PIAS3 in the presence of progesterone.</p><p>The PIAS family is known to inhibit DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Consequently, it was important to determine whether PIAS3 could form a complex with PRB on DNA, and whether the presence of PIAS3 could, in part, affect PR DNA-binding activity. Data from ChIP and gel shift assays demonstrated that PIAS3 was recruited to endogenous PR-responsive promoters and inhibited the DNA-binding activity of PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We then hypothesized that PIAS3 inhibited the interaction of PR with its target DNA by binding to its DBD. It has been previously reported that the signal for nuclear export of PR is contained within its DBD domain, which functions as the export signal in multiple steroid receptor family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Our data showed PIAS3 which influenced the nuclear export of PRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). One possible mechanism of action is that PIAS3 might contribute to the DBD structure, which augments recognition of the signal by the export machinery and by interacting with the DBD domain of PR.</p><p>Alternatively, it is still possible that the observed inhibition of PRB involved PIAS3-mediated SUMO modification of transcription regulators other than PRB, as PIAS3 overexpression might enhance the SUMO modification of many proteins. Although the precise identity of these SUMO conjugates is not known, they are likely to include numerous transcriptional regulators known to undergo SUMO modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). It is conceivable that the enhanced modification of some of these factors can indirectly regulate PRB activity. Consistent with this model, p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) and LEF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) are both inhibited by PIAS3 protein overexpression, independent of their ability to be directly modified by SUMO.</p><p>In summary, our findings demonstrated that PIAS3 protein significantly inhibited PR-mediated transactivation, which was accompanied by a strong induction of PR sumoylation in a progesterone-dependent manner. The pattern of PIAS3-triggered PRB SUMO modification was identified at three sites, Lys-7, Lys-388 and Lys-531. We further identified a novel role for Lys-7 and Lys-531 in the nuclear retention of PRB and the ligand-triggered transactivation of PRB. Our data demonstrated that PIAS3 inhibited gene activation by ligand-stimulated PRB in a manner that was independent of PRB SUMO modification. In addition, SUMO modifications of PRB significantly increased PRB stability, rendering it resistant to progesterone-induced degradation. Finally, we demonstrated that the mechanism by which PIAS3 protein strongly inhibited PRB-activated transcription was mediated by the interaction between PRB and PIAS3, which inhibited the DNA-binding activity of PRB and influenced its nuclear export.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplemenatry data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec>

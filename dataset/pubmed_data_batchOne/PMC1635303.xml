In this study we have investigated the effects on mtDNA replication of manipulating TFAM expression in cultured human cells. Mammalian mtDNA replication intermediates (RIs) fall into two classes, whose mechanistic relationship is not properly understood. One class is characterized by extensive RNA incorporation on the lagging strand, whereas the other has the structure of products of conventional, strand-coupled replication. TFAM overexpression increased the overall abundance of RIs and shifted them substantially towards those of the conventional, strand-coupled type. The shift was most pronounced in the rDNA region and at various replication pause sites and was accompanied by a drop in the relative amount of replication-termination intermediates, a substantial reduction in mitochondrial transcripts, mtDNA decatenation and progressive copy number depletion. TFAM overexpression could be partially phenocopied by treatment of cells with dideoxycytidine, suggesting that its effects are partially attributable to a decreased rate of fork progression. TFAM knockdown also resulted in mtDNA depletion, but RIs remained mainly of the ribosubstituted type, although termination intermediates were enhanced. We propose that TFAM influences the mode of mtDNA replication via its combined effects on different aspects of mtDNA metabolism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In mammalian cells, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was long believed to replicate by an unusual, strand-asymmetric mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). However, recent studies, using two-dimensional neutral agarose gel electrophoresis (2DNAGE), have revealed the presence, both in vertebrate tissues and cultured cells, of two classes of mtDNA replication intermediates (RIs) whose structures are not consistent with the strand-asymmetric model. Both classes are essentially duplex throughout their length, but differ in their ribonucleotide content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). One class shows <bold>e</bold>xtensive <bold>R</bold>NA <bold>i</bold>ncorporation <bold>o</bold>n the <bold>l</bold>agging <bold>s</bold>trand [ERIOLS, Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)], whereas the other has structures fully consistent with conventional, strand-coupled DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). ERIOLS intermediates are generally nicked or gapped on the RNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) and are hence labile to partial degradation during extraction.</p><p>The mechanistic relationship between RIs of the ERIOLS and strand-coupled types, as well as how they relate to the &#x02018;orthodox&#x02019;, strand-asymmetric replication model, are not properly understood. ERIOLS intermediates have been suggested to be processed to resemble those of the strand-coupled type via a maturation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Different replication modes may also operate simultaneously in the same cell. In solid tissues, strand-coupled replication appears to initiate bidirectionally in a broad origin zone, spanning at least several kilobases downstream of the major non-coding region (NCR) of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In cultured cells recovering from drug-induced mtDNA depletion, such initiation is confined to a much narrower region of the NCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The initiation mechanism which gives rise to RIs of the ERIOLS type remains unclear. Initiation within the NCR can also give rise to the synthesis of 7S DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), which establishes the characteristic D-loop form of mtDNA, although its relationship with productive replication of the genome remains enigmatic.</p><p>The mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM, an abundant HMG-box protein of mitochondria, appears to have multiple functions in mtDNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). It was originally characterized by the absolute requirement for the protein for transcriptional initiation <italic>in vitro</italic> at either the heavy- or light-strand promoter of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). More recently, these findings were confirmed using a fully reconstituted system, containing mtDNA-derived templates, RNA polymerase and the additional transcription factor TFB1M or TFB2M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Transcription from the light-strand promoter is required to create the primer for heavy-strand mtDNA synthesis according to the orthodox, strand-asymmetric replication model. Therefore TFAM has been considered to be an essential protein also for mtDNA replication. Consistent with this view, abolition of TFAM expression using a conditional knockout strategy in the mouse showed clearly that TFAM is required for mtDNA maintenance as well as cellular function and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). However, this finding is also consistent with TFAM protein having other essential roles in mtDNA metabolism.</p><p>TFAM has been proposed to play a structural role in the maintenance of the mitochondrial chromosome, independent of its transcriptional activity. It is highly abundant, is mainly (or entirely) complexed with mtDNA in nucleoid structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), shows significant, non sequence-specific DNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and promotes DNA compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), leading to the suggestion that it coats the entire DNA in a manner similar to histones in the eukaryotic nucleus or the HU protein in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Its homologue in yeast, Abf2p, has been shown to induce compaction by introducing sharp bends into the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and is required for the stable maintenance of wild-type mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian TFAM has preference for binding to branched DNA structures such as Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and to cisplatin-damaged or oxidized DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, TFAM promotes the resolution of D-loop forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). It also interacts physically with p53 [Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>)], suggesting a possible function in DNA repair or other recombinational processes. Although it does not have a directly protective role, TFAM overexpression in rat myoblasts has been reported to accelerate the recovery of mtDNA levels after peroxide damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) and transgenic expression of human TFAM in mice mitigates mtDNA loss and other mitochondrial defects after cardiac ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In yeast, Abf2p is required for recombination and segregation of mtDNA to daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and genetic evidence also implicates it in non-recombinational mtDNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). All of these pieces of evidence point to TFAM and its homologues being key regulators of DNA transactions in mitochondria.</p><p><italic>In organello</italic>, TFAM imported into rat liver mitochondria stimulates the synthesis both of mitochondrial RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) and 7S DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Transient overexpression of TFAM in cultured HEK cells also results in increased transcription, but with no change in mtDNA copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). However, high levels of TFAM added exogenously <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), as well as prolonged over expression in HEKcultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), bring about a paradoxical decrease in transcription. This effect may be attributable to an over-condensed state in the template DNA. The transient increase in mitochondrial transcription brought about by TFAM over-expression in HEK cells is accompanied by an increased level of RNase H-sensitive mtDNA species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), which may correspond with RIs of the ERIOLS type.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that TFAM regulates mtDNA copy number independently of its role(s) in transcription. Heterozygosity for TFAM knockout produces copy number depletion of &#x0223c;40% in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and 50% in chicken cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), but with minimal effects on RNA levels. Although human TFAM has only a weak transcription-stimulatory effect on mouse mtDNA promoters <italic>in vitro</italic>, transgenic expression of human TFAM in mice produces a stoichiometric increase in mtDNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Overexpression of a transcriptionally inert variant of TFAM in human cells also results in a proportionate copy number increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), whilst TFAM knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) causes copy number depletion with only minor effects on transcription per template molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In chicken cells in which the endogenous c-TFAM gene has been disrupted, transgenic c-TFAM lacking the C-terminal tail region required for transcription-promoting activity is nevertheless able to support maintenance of mtDNA at 50% of wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p><p>The idea that TFAM regulates mtDNA copy number by a simple titration model is, however, contradicted by the observation that, following transient, ethidium bromide (EtBr)-induced mtDNA depletion in cultured cells, TFAM levels were observed to recover more slowly than mtDNA. This suggests that the packing ratio of TFAM on mtDNA can vary and may influence the rate of mtDNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>).</p><p>In order to investigate further the effects and mode of action of TFAM on mtDNA replication and copy number modulation, we analysed mitochondrial RIs from cells overexpressing TFAM and from cells in which TFAM expression was knocked down by RNAi. We report here that overexpression of TFAM brings about a dramatic change in the relative abundance of strand-coupled versus ribosubstituted (ERIOLS-type) RIs, accompanied by systematic alterations in copy number, transcript levels and mtDNA topology. In contrast, TFAM knockdown results in copy number depletion, but with only minimal effects on mtDNA RIs. The findings are consistent with the idea that the synthesis of mtDNA is dependent on at least two different TFAM-influenced processes, one of which is transcription-associated, the other related to mtDNA organization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>TFAM constructs</title><p>Full-length <italic>TFAM</italic> cDNA lacking its usual stop codon was amplified from a cDNA clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, kind gift of Dr R.

Transient expression (data not shown) produced essentially the same effects on all parameters studied as inducible over-expression using the Flp-In&#x02122; T-Rex system, although with less quantitative reproducibility. Inducible over-expression of TFAM carrying a C-terminal MycHis tag produced qualitatively similar but quantitatively more dramatic effects, namely a small but transient increase in mtDNA copy number, followed by progressive mtDNA depletion. After 10 days of full induction (10 ng/ml doxycyclin, full details on the use of the induction system to be published elsewhere, Wanrooij <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation), TFAM-MycHis expression resulted in the reduction of mtDNA levels to &#x0223c;20% of control levels. Over-expression of TFAM with its normal stop codon (TFAM-stop) caused a decrease in mtDNA copy number of 40&#x02013;60%. Copy number depletion was verified by two independent methods, real-time PCR and phosphorimaging of Southern blots (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2).</p><p>Although the absolute amount of TFAM protein did not increase markedly during induction, measured relative to a loading control (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2), the progressive drop in mtDNA copy number means that the amount of TFAM protein per mtDNA molecule did increase substantially and consistently during induction: in the case of TFAM-stop to over twice the endogenous level, in the case of TFAM-MycHis by an order of magnitude. Crude fractionation of mitochondrial protein lysates by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation (Supplementary Figure 2) showed that over-expressed TFAM-MycHis partitioned, like endogenous TFAM, mainly into the pellet fraction, forming high-molecular weight complexes in the same proportion as endogenous TFAM, indicating that it is likely complexed with mtDNA.</p><p>Previous experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in organello</italic> have suggested that a large excess of TFAM can suppress rather than activate transcription. We measured the steady-state levels of various mitochondrial transcripts using northern blot analysis (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 and other data not shown), under conditions where over-expression of TFAM-stop or TFAM-MycHis was induced <italic>in vivo</italic>. The level of short-lived mRNAs such as ND3 showed a marked decline even relative to the decreased amount of mtDNA. Although modulation of post-transcriptional processing and RNA stability contribute to changes in the steady-state level even of short-lived transcripts, the drop in ND3 mRNA levels is consistent with a substantial drop in transcription per template molecule, under conditions of TFAM over-expression, which was especially marked for TFAM carrying the C-terminal MycHis tag. As a more rigorous and direct test of its effects on transcriptional activity, we also analysed the consequences of TFAM-MycHis expression on the rate of recovery in mitochondrial tRNA levels in cells treated for 72 h with EtBr, following removal of the drug (Supplementary Figure 4).</p><p>In conformity with the published literature, RNAi knockdown of TFAM produced a progressive reduction of TFAM protein levels and mtDNA copy number. A combination of two siRNAs was selected, based on preliminary trials, which decreased TFAM protein to low levels (&#x0003c;10%) during 7 or 14 days continuous culture (Supplementary Figure 3). Over shorter-time periods, both TFAM protein and mtDNA depletion by RNAi were rather modest and the levels of TFAM protein or ND3 mRNA per template mtDNA molecule were almost unchanged from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Altered TFAM expression leads to systematic effects on mtDNA replication intermediates</title><p>The copy number depletion of mtDNA produced either by RNAi knockdown or by over-expression prompted us to investigate further the effects of these treatments on mtDNA replication, using 2DNAGE. Transient expression of TFAM-stop or inducible overexpression of either TFAM-stop or TFAM-MycHis, produced dramatic and systematic effects on the patterns of mtDNA RIs, which were essentially the same in all three cases (Supplementary Figure 5b). The most consistent effects on RIs were seen after 48 h of induced over-expression (or 48 h after transient transfection), when effects on mitochondrial transcripts were clearly evident and quite similar in all cases.</p><p>TFAM overexpression resulted in a substantially increased abundance of RIs relative to the unit-length restriction fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; see Supplementary Figure 5 for further explanations and interpretations of the gel data). For example, using a restriction enzyme which cuts only once in the genome (PvuII, np 2560, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), TFAM over-expression gave a clear enhancement of the clubheaded bubble arc indicative of initiation far upstream of the restriction site, as well as revealing a prominent simple Y-arc. In uninduced cells these RIs were either much fainter or absent. The main features were the clubheaded bubble arc and corresponding double-Y arc, as well as a number of species that were sensitive to or modified by, RNaseI treatment. The RNaseI-sensitive species included circular molecules, a short arc which corresponds with dimeric circles and/or broken theta forms (T. Yasukawa, personal communication), plus a diffuse cloud of material migrating in the region between circular molecules and the bubble arc. A putative termination arc was also visible only in uninduced cells, although this was revealed more clearly when other species were modified by RNaseI (Supplementary Figure 5).</p><p>In other digests, the exact transformations of RIs resulting from TFAM overexpression varied according to which region of the genome was being analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>&#x02013;e). In general, ERIOLS-type RIs, i.e. slow-moving arcs and &#x02018;clouds&#x02019; of heterogeneous, nuclease-sensitive material were diminished and migrated as more discrete entities. There was general enhancement of nuclease-resistant arcs, in particular those resistant to S1 nuclease. In addition, rather specific sub-types of RIs were seen to accumulate along the arcs, which differed from those seen in uninduced or untransfected cells.</p><p>Changes were most dramatic in the rDNA region, extending to O<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). In uninduced cells, in contrast to the patterns of RIs from this region of the genome seen in solid tissues or in cultured cells recovering from drug-induced mtDNA depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), complete Y-arcs of the strand-coupled type were not detectable, even on long exposure. Instead, a heterogeneous &#x02018;cloud&#x02019; of complex, high-molecular weight material was seen, plus the ascending portion of a Y-like arc, ending in a faintly detected replication pause site within the ND1 gene. These forms were partially sensitive to or modified by nucleases. In TFAM overexpressing cells, a complete Y-arc was easily detected, even at relatively low exposure. The descending portion of this arc was now the most prominent, although this segment was relatively sensitive to nucleases. The cloud of heterogeneous material was replaced by at least two discrete, slow-moving Y-like arcs, which were also nuclease-sensitive. The replication pause in ND1 was prominently detected after S1 nuclease treatment.</p><p>The major NCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), containing the principal sites of replication initiation and termination, showed more subtle changes, affecting most obviously the termination region. In uninduced cells, the most prominent species were termination intermediates lying on or close to the apex of the X-arc, plus a heterogeneous cloud of material migrating at high molecular weight which, after nuclease treatment, was either modified (RNaseI or H) or abolished (S1). The ascending portion was the most prominent portion of the partial Y arc and this was also sensitive to ribonucleases, as was the bubble arc. In TFAM overexpressing cells the bubble arc was barely visible even on long exposure and the descending portion of the partial Y arc, leading to the termination site, was strongly enhanced. However, termination intermediates lying on the X-arc were less prominent, especially after S1 nuclease treatment. Heterogeneous, high molecular weight, S1-sensitive material was less dispersed and its migration less affected by ribonucleases.</p><p>We next analysed the nature of fully double-stranded (i.e. S1 nuclease-resistant) RIs around the genome in further detail, under conditions of TFAM overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Different restriction digests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) confirmed that TFAM overexpression led to an accumulation of material on the standard Y arc in the region approaching the terminus at O<sub>H</sub>, with a corresponding loss of termination intermediates in which the fork had entered the fragment from the other end and stalled at the terminus prior to resolution.</p><p>A number of pause sites or regions were strongly enhanced, in addition to the strong pause in ND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). These included the pause at O<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), several discrete sites in the regions of ND4, ND3, COXIII, A6 and A8, most of the COXII gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) and a broad region of the ND5 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Conversely, the abundance of 7S DNA was diminished by TFAM overexpression (Figure 6).</p><p>RNAi knockdown of TFAM expression produced more subtle effects on RIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). RIs resistant to S1 nuclease were little altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), but ribonuclease-sensitive &#x02018;clouds&#x02019; of heterogeneous, nuclease-sensitive material were somewhat enhanced, especially in the rDNA region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) or showed altered mobility. The clearest transformation was seen in the origin/termination region encompassing O<sub>H</sub>, where there was an increase in the abundance of double-Y termination intermediates lying on the X-arc, relative to the bubble and partial Y arcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), an opposite result to that produced from TFAM overexpression, which diminished the abundance of termination intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>TFAM over-expression shows similarities with ddC treatment</title><p>Arcs of fully double-stranded, ribonuclease-insensitive RIs should be generated by true strand-coupled replication. However, they could also arise from maturation of ERIOLS type intermediates and, if so, should be enhanced where leading-strand synthesis has stalled randomly or has been drastically slowed (i.e. if the rate of lagging-strand maturation is now comparable with that of fork progression). The effects of TFAM overexpression could thus be interpreted either as a switch to strand-coupled-type replication or as a general slowing in progression of the replication fork, such that maturation of the lagging strand now occurred as fast as the fork progressed.</p><p>To address this issue we compared the effects on mtDNA RIs of TFAM over-expression with treatment of cells with the replication inhibitor dideoxycytidine, ddC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). After conversion to ddCTP this drug produces repeated chain termination events during mtDNA replication, requiring removal of the incorporated dideoxynucleotide by exonuclease action or recombination, thus greatly slowing down the overall rate of fork progression and leading to mtDNA depletion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, ddC treatment induced rather similar transformations in the pattern of mtDNA RIs as those brought about by TFAM overexpression: progressive and dramatic reduction in ERIOLS-type RIs, a corresponding increase in fully double-stranded RIs of the strand-coupled type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) and the disappearance of termination intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, panels i&#x02013;iii). Removal of the drug rapidly induced a burst of mtDNA replication but with intermediates remaining initially of the strand-coupled type and with a delayed re-appearance of termination intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, panel vii). However, both during and following ddCTP treatment, the enhancement of RIs of the strand-coupled type was more general than that resulting from enhanced TFAM expression, rather than being concentrated in the rDNA region and at replication pause sites (e.g. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, panels ii and iii).</p></sec><sec><title>Alterations to TFAM expression modify mtDNA topology</title><p>The effects of TFAM overexpression on mtDNA replication might reflect TFAM-induced changes in transcription or in the overall organization of mtDNA. To test whether modulation of TFAM expression affects mtDNA topology or organization, we analysed uncut mtDNA from TFAM-induced and uninduced cells, both before and after treatment with various DNA-modifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In uninduced cells, most of the mtDNA migrated either as relaxed circles or in high molecular weight catenated forms that were sensitive to topoisomerase IV but not topoisomerase I. A pronounced smear of material was also visible in the high molecular weight region of the gel. Induced TFAM over-expression resulted in a pronounced shift towards monomeric supercoils, with much less catenated mtDNA, including the high molecular weight smear, as well as creating novel junctional forms that were resolved by phage T7 gp3 endonuclease. Despite these differences, the residual products from combined treatment with topoisomerase IV and T7 gp3 were strikingly similar, when comparing TFAM-induced and uninduced cells. ddC treatment also resulted in a shift away from catenated forms in favour of monomeric circles, both relaxed and supercoiled (Supplementary Figure 6). TFAM knockdown by RNAi produced more subtle changes in mtDNA topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), with an increased level of one particular high molecular weight species (arrowed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and of linear molecules. The arrowed species corresponded in mobility with a catenated form which could be enhanced in control cell mtDNA by treatment with T7 gp3 endonuclease and thus might represent an abortive termination product.</p><p>Finally, we analysed the effects of various treatments on the steady-state level of 7S DNA. Both ddC treatment [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>); Supplementary Figure 6] and TFAM overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) resulted in a substantial drop in the amount of 7S DNA relative to other forms of mtDNA, whereas TFAM knockdown resulted in a small increase in 7S DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study we investigated the effects on mtDNA replication of modulating TFAM expression in cultured human cells. Sustained over-expression, resulting in a &#x0003e;2-fold increase in the ratio of TFAM to mtDNA, greatly enhanced the steady-state levels of RIs of the strand-coupled type, with corresponding depletion of ribonucleotide-rich, ERIOLS-type RIs. This was accompanied by decreased mitochondrial transcription, depletion of 7S DNA and of replication-termination intermediates, reduced copy number and decatenation of mtDNA. TFAM knockdown in the same cell background also produced copy number depletion, but with different alterations to mtDNA topology, no systematic effects on transcription and, apart from a strong enhancement of termination intermediates, virtually no change in the pattern of RIs. The findings suggest that TFAM can influence mtDNA replication and copy number in several different ways.</p><sec><title>TFAM as a structural protein of the mitochondrial chromosome</title><p>Previous views of TFAM as a copy number regulator have assumed that the ratio of TFAM:mtDNA is invariant, so that changes in the rate of TFAM synthesis determine the amount of mtDNA present in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). However, the observation of a reduced ratio of TFAM protein to mtDNA during mtDNA reamplification following EtBr treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) suggests that the TFAM:mtDNA ratio is not invariant and may indeed be subject to regulation, affecting mtDNA copy number in ways distinct from a simple titration model.</p><p>The present study offers support to the latter view, by confirming that an increased ratio of TFAM protein to mtDNA can be sustained in human cells and has systematic, but opposite effects on mtDNA copy number than would be predicted by the simple titration model. Moreover, whereas most experiments hitherto conducted on TFAM have employed highly non-physiological tools, such as cells treated with EtBr, heterologous expression of a human protein in mice or of a truncated TFAM variant never seen in nature, we observed alterations in mtDNA replication and copy number resulting from increased expression of a protein identical to endogenous TFAM. The fact that we were able to achieve and sustain an increased ratio of TFAM to mtDNA contradicts the titration model, but is consistent with the results of studies using <italic>in organello</italic> footprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), which indicate that protein binding to mtDNA is not uniform and thus that there are sites ordinarily unoccupied by protein where over-expressed TFAM can potentially bind.</p><p>The effects of TFAM over-expression on RIs were qualitatively very similar to those brought about by treatment with the drug ddC which, following conversion to ddCTP, is assumed to be a potent inducer of repeated replication stalling via premature DNA chain termination. ddC treatment also resulted in a large increase in the steady-state levels of nuclease-resistant RIs of the strand-coupled type from all around the mitochondrial genome, with concomitant loss of termination intermediates. Although the effects of these treatments were not absolutely identical, with TFAM overexpression generating a subtly different pattern of such RIs, especially in the rDNA region and in the vicinity of pause sites, their overall similarity strongly suggests that the main effect of TFAM is, like ddC, to provoke a substantial decrease in the net rate of DNA synthesis. This may reflect an increased compaction of mtDNA when the ratio of TFAM protein to mtDNA is increased, such that decondensation of the nucleoid becomes rate-limiting for fork progression. The TFAM-specific transformations of RIs may reflect different degrees of compaction and inhibition of fork progression in different regions of the mitochondrial genome, depending on their affinity for TFAM and other proteins.</p><p>The increased abundance of strand-coupled RIs may thus be due to maturation of ERIOLS-type intermediates, which we assume normally to be a slow step compared with the rate of fork progression. If the latter is slowed by increased compaction, the rate of maturation may become comparable with it. Alternatively, if the two classes of RI represent entirely different modes of DNA replication, ERIOLS type replication might be unable to use a highly compacted mtDNA template, leaving only strand-coupled replication (with a less discrete origin, as implied by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Initiation of bidirectional, strand-coupled replication in many bacterial plasmids is stimulated by or dependent on, DNA-bending proteins functionally related to the HMG superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Excess TFAM may thus lead to copy number depletion by enforcing a switch to an inherently slower replication mode or simply by suppressing the alternative mode.</p><p>Exactly the same transformations of RIs were produced by transient expression of TFAM as were produced by inducible expression of either natural or C-terminally MycHis-tagged TFAM. However, the two inducible variants brought about copy number depletion with markedly different kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Copy number depletion may thus not be due entirely to a change in the rate of fork progression, but involve also another TFAM-related process with which the C-terminal tag may interfere. Such an effect could, however, be indirect. The amount of TFAM-MycHis protein rose much more steeply than TFAM-stop during induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Figures 1 and 2), suggesting that it may escape physiological turnover mechanisms. This is supported by the observation (Supplementary Figure 2) that TFAM-MycHis almost completely replaced endogenous TFAM during induction. The fact that sustained overexpression of natural TFAM is comparatively difficult to achieve may reflect a natural homeostatic mechanism, whereby TFAM levels can modulate copy number only within certain limits.</p><p>Another possibility is that, as for other HMG proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>), the C-terminal tail of TFAM recruits or interacts with other nucleoid proteins. It is already implicated in interactions with specific components of the transcriptional apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). The epitope tag may therefore disturb interactions with other nucleoid proteins involved in copy number homeostasis. Copy number derangement produced in cells or mice by C-terminally truncated or heterologous TFAM variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) may prove to be due to loss of such regulation, rather than by the titration model inferred previously.</p><p>The fact that RNAi knockdown of TFAM results in copy number depletion without substantial changes in the patterns of RIs is further evidence that at least one other TFAM-dependent process is critical for mtDNA maintenance. One obvious possibility already mentioned is the compaction of nascent mtDNA into TFAM-containing nucleoid structures, in the absence of which the newly replicated mtDNA may simply be unstable. Other possibilities are discussed below.</p></sec><sec><title>TFAM as a regulator of mitochondrial transcription</title><p>Although TFAM was originally identified and named on the basis of its being essential for mtDNA transcription, previous studies have shown that excess TFAM, supplied either to a reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) or produced by sustained overexpression in HEKcultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), results in a paradoxical suppression of transcription. Our own observations are consistent with this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Figures 1 and 2).</p><p>A drop in transcriptional activity could, conceivably, underlie the switch in DNA replication mode that favours the generation of strand-coupled RIs. Although the decrease in transcriptional activity which accompanies TFAM overexpression appears modest, according to the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2), the steady-state level of ND3 mRNA is a relatively insensitive measure of the actual transcription rate. The mechanism by which ERIOLS-type RIs are generated remains unknown. However, since on 2DNAGE they include heterogeneous &#x02018;clouds&#x02019; of material sensitive to both RNaseI and RNaseH which are suppressed by TFAM overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), it is possible that they could arise by a mechanism involving either preformed RNA or nascent transcripts. Transcriptional suppression by excess TFAM, rather than over-compaction of the nucleoid, may therefore be the mechanism driving replication towards the slower, strand-coupled mode. In support of this, the segment of the genome most affected by TFAM overexpression is also the most heavily transcribed region (rDNA), in which discrete RIs are ordinarily hard to detect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), but became prominent when TFAM was overexpressed.</p><p>Whereas copy number depletion brought about by TFAM overexpression was accompanied by a clear drop in transcription, transcription per template molecule appeared unchanged when copy number was depleted by TFAM knockdown. Copy number regulation may therefore be independent of transcription. However, transcription was more severely affected by overexpression of epitope-tagged TFAM than natural TFAM and also provoked a more rapid drop in mtDNA copy number. The issue of a relationship between the transcriptional activity of TFAM and copy number control thus remains open.</p><p>TFAM overexpression leads to reduced levels of 7S DNA, which might reflect decreased transcriptional activity at the light-strand promoter and/or enhanced resolution of D-loop forms <italic>in vivo</italic>, another known property of TFAM [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), see also following section]. If D-loops represent a precursor step in DNA replication, as proposed by the orthodox model, their depletion by TFAM overexpression may be crucial in bringing about copy number reduction or in inducing a switch to strand-coupled replication. On the other hand, the increased level of 7S DNA resulting from TFAM knockdown shows clearly that the D-loop form is not sufficient to maintain a high copy number.</p></sec><sec><title>TFAM as an enhancer of replication pausing</title><p>Replication pauses are well documented in both bacteria and eukaryotes, as well as in plasmids and mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). However, their roles in DNA homeostasis are unclear, except where they function as definitive terminators. In human mtDNA, prominent pauses occur at the so-called termination-associated site delimiting 7S DNA, at O<sub>L</sub> and in the region immediately downstream of rDNA, within the ND1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). One possibility is that, as in yeast rDNA, these pauses are the signatures of proteins which bind at specific sites to facilitate the passage of oppositely moving replication and transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>) or simply markers of collision sites, as in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>), at which replication finally resumes after dissociation of the transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Although TFAM has only a low sequence-specificity for DNA-binding, it may enhance such pauses by promoting DNA-bending, as proposed for the protein Sap1p at one of the replication pause sites in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Such bending may also facilitate the binding of other, more sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, which directly function in fork arrest. Both copy number depletion and transcriptional inhibition following TFAM overexpression may therefore be due, at least in part, to its effect as a strong enhancer of replication pausing.</p></sec><sec><title>TFAM as a cofactor in junctional resolution</title><p>TFAM overexpression and TFAM knockdown produced opposite effects on the abundance of termination intermediates. Whereas these were depleted by TFAM overexpression (or ddC treatment), they were strongly enhanced by TFAM knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). A simple interpretation is that resolution of these forms is a late and slow step in mtDNA replication, which is in some way dependent on the supply of TFAM. Under conditions of TFAM overexpression, either that step is facilitated by increased loading of TFAM onto the nascent DNA or the rate of fork progression is slowed down so much that resolution of termination intermediates is no longer rate-limiting. Under conditions of TFAM &#x02018;starvation&#x02019; this resolution step would conversely be inhibited and this may be the primary reason for copy number depletion following TFAM knockdown.</p><p>TFAM is already known to have binding preference for junctional structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), to facilitate the resolution of D-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and to bend DNA in a manner analogous with bacterial proteins such as HU and IHF. The exact molecular structure of mtDNA replication-termination intermediates is unclear, although it cannot simply comprise two oppositely moving forks that have almost met, since such a structure would be thermally unstable unless the unreplicated region between them were at least 50 bp, in which case they would not lie precisely on the X-arc on 2DNAGE gels. One possibility is that they are held together by hemicatenation after ligation of at least one strand, although such forms should be S1 nuclease-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). Another is that they are converted to true Holliday junctions. A third option is that they contain a single or even double chicken-foot structure.</p><p>Whatever their precise nature, a complex enzymatic machinery should be required both to form and to resolve them, in which TFAM is a plausible player, both because of its DNA-binding preferences and bending properties and by its putative ability to recruit other proteins to the DNA. DNA-bending is required for the protein-based partition systems of low copy-number bacterial plasmids such as P1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>) and binding sites for the DNA-bending proteins H-NS and FIS appear to be clustered around the replication terminus in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). HMG and related proteins are widely implicated as cofactors in recombination. For example, mammalian HMGB1 facilitates V(D)J recombination by the RAG proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). In bacteria, HU is essential for efficient homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>) and IHF is required for the action of lambda integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). HMG proteins are able to facilitate recombination even in heterologous systems [see Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>)]. In yeast mitochondria, overexpression of Abf2p promotes the formation of recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). DNA-bending by TFAM may facilitate analogous processes in human mtDNA.</p><p>A rather different interpretation would also be consistent with the 2DNAGE data, namely that TFAM overexpression leads to a high frequency of strand breakage at O<sub>H</sub>. This would account both for the relative paucity of bubble arcs in O<sub>H</sub>-containing fragments, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">c</xref>), for the corresponding increase in simple Y arcs and for the loss of termination intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3b</xref>). Such strand-breakage is very unlikely to be an extraction artefact, since these differences from control cells were seen in all of the many DNA preparations analysed. If this interpretation is correct, it may imply a need for true recombination reaction to resolve daughter molecules, which could be much slower than the usual termination/resolution step. Copy number depletion might therefore be due to interference with termination when TFAM is either overexpressed or downregulated.</p><p>In addition, TFAM overexpression resulted in apparent decatenation of mtDNA, whereas TFAM knockdown increased the level of linear molecules and of one decatenated species that could also be generated in control cell mtDNA by treatment with T7 gp3 endonuclease, a promiscuous junctional resolvase. It is tempting to suggest that these species may be aberrant breakdown products resulting from failure of the normal termination step under conditions of TFAM deficiency. The loss of catenated species in favour of monomeric supercoils under conditions of TFAM overexpression may again reflect the altered kinetics of mtDNA replication, since it too was brought about by ddC treatment. Alternatively an overcompacted state of mtDNA resulting from excess TFAM may directly prevent catenation or stimulate decatenation, as is known for the <italic>E.coli</italic> HU protein acting on circular plasmid molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). Decatenation might also result from frequent strand-breakage at O<sub>H</sub>. Under conditions of decreased copy number, decatenation should be important for dispersal of newly replicated mtDNAs into nucleoids, to restrain mitotic segregation of possibly deleterious mtDNA sequence variants. In yeast, the TFAM homologue Abf2p is required for efficient parsing of mtDNA into nucleoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>), although this process appears to involve recombination rather than decatenation.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological role of TFAM as a mtDNA copy number regulator</title><p>Our findings indicate that, at least in this particular proliferating cell background, TFAM expression is finely poised. Any marked deviations from what appears to be an optimal expression level provoke alterations to mtDNA replication that result in decreased mtDNA levels.</p><p>Previous studies of the transcriptional regulation of the TFAM gene indicate that it is sensitive to signals connected with metabolite supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>) and redox stress, via the phosphorylation of NRF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>) and to proliferative, differentiation-linked and environmental signals via the co-activators PGC1 and PRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>) and the transcription factor Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>). This raises the issue of whether there is an additional homeostatic, mechanism to fine-tune TFAM expression to the physical state of mtDNA, which can be circumvented by the manipulations we carried out. A retrograde signalling pathway of this type might serve to ensure that disturbances in mtDNA replication or segregation do not lead to a copy number catastrophe. Alternatively, the level of TFAM expression and possibly also its post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>), may function <italic>in vivo</italic> to accelerate or decelerate mtDNA replication, thus constituting a key determinant of copy number.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Outi Kurronen and Merja Jokela for technical assistance, Takehiro Yasukawa, Aurelio Reyes, Gertjan Hakkaart, Anu Suomalainen (Wartiovaara) and colleagues for constant advice and critical input and Rudi Wiesner for supplying the anti-TFAM antibody.

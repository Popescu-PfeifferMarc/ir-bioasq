Action of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> MurI on DNA gyrase activity has been examined and its mode of action elucidated. We demonstrate that mycobacterial MurI inhibits DNA gyrase activity, in addition to its precursor independent racemization function. The inhibition is not species-specific as <italic>E.coli</italic> gyrase is also inhibited but is enzyme-specific as topoisomerase I activity remains unaltered. The mechanism of inhibition is different from other well-known gyrase inhibitors. MurI binds to GyrA subunit of the enzyme leading to a decrease in DNA-binding of the holoenzyme. The sequestration of the gyrase by MurI results in inhibition of all reactions catalysed by DNA gyrase. MurI is thus not a typical potent inhibitor of DNA gyrase and instead its role could be in modulation of the gyrase activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Topoisomerases are essential enzymes, responsible for maintenance of the level of supercoiling of DNA in cells. DNA gyrase is unique amongst all topoisomerases in its ability to catalyze negative supercoiling of DNA in an ATP dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Besides supercoiling, the enzyme catalyzes catenation/decatenation and knotting/unknotting reactions <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). It is also known to relax negatively supercoiled DNA in absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The functional holoenzyme is a heterotetramer (A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>) comprising of two GyrA and GyrB subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>DNA gyrase is an indispensable enzyme in prokaryotes and is a proven target for diverse classes of antibacterial agents. Mechanistically, gyrase inhibitors have been classified mainly into two broad categories. The first category includes coumarins and cyclothialidines that inhibit ATP hydrolysis catalysed by DNA gyrase. These antibiotics bind to GyrB at a region overlapping to ATP binding site, thus preventing ATP binding. As a result, they inhibit only the supercoiling activity of the enzyme with no effect on the relaxation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The second class includes the synthetic quinolones, which function as gyrase poisons, by stabilizing enzyme&#x02013;DNA covalent intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The protein&#x02013;DNA adducts hinder the progress of replication and transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). They also lead to widespread chromosome fragmentation due to the release of DNA ends from the ternary complexes, resulting in rapid quinolone-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). In addition, proteinaceous toxins such as ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotic, microcin B17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), ParE from RK2 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and CcdB encoded by F plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) inhibit gyrase by arresting the enzyme&#x02013;DNA covalent intermediates, leading to the accumulation of double-strand breaks, upon removal of the protein constraints. New inhibitors of DNA gyrase have been reported recently. These proteins appear to inhibit DNA gyrase in a manner distinct from the other two classes of inhibitors. For example, GyrI from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), MfpA from <italic>Mycobacterium sp.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) inhibit DNA gyrase by interfering with gyrase&#x02013;DNA interaction.</p><p>Glutamate racemase (MurI) catalyses the conversion of <sc>l</sc>-glutamate to <sc>d</sc>-glutamate, an essential component of the peptidoglycan. Besides racemization activity, <italic>E.coli</italic> MurI possesses an additional DNA gyrase inhibitory function. The inhibition of DNA gyrase requires the presence of peptidoglycan precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Studies with <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> revealed that it possesses two genes encoding glutamate racemases, the poly-gamma-glutamate synthesis-linking Glr enzyme and YrpC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Only the YrpC (MurI) isozyme, but not the Glr, negatively influences the activity of DNA gyrase, that too in the absence of the precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> genome sequence revealed the presence of a single gene for glutamate racemase. Further, mycobacterial DNA gyrase shows distinctive features with respect to quinolone susceptibility and resistance to the action of toxins like CcdB and microcin B17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we have examined the effect of glutamate racemase from <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> on DNA gyrase activity and elucidate its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>E.coli</italic> strains DH5&#x003b1; and BL26(DE3) were used for cloning and overexpression of mycobacterial MurI respectively.

In order to assess the effect of MurI on gyrase&#x02013;DNA non-covalent complex, labeled DNA (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M) was incubated with 100 nM of DNA gyrase either in absence or presence of different concentrations of MurI for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C followed by electrophoresis on 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 45 mM Tris&#x02013;borate buffer containing 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 4&#x000b0;C.

The authenticity of the protein was verified by tryptic mass fingerprinting analysis (data not shown). MALDI-TOF analysis revealed the molecular mass of the purified protein to be 28&#x02009;796 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The racemization activity was assessed by monitoring the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm. For this, MurI was initially incubated in presence of <sc>d</sc>-glutamate. <sc>l</sc>-Glutamate formed as a result of MurI racemase activity was measured by adding NAD<sup>+</sup> and GDH. GDH-mediated conversion from <sc>l</sc>-glutamate to &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate led to the reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, the samples incubated with MurI, showed a significant increase in OD at 340 nm with time in a dose-dependent manner. The reaction with <sc>l</sc>-glutamate as a substrate served as a positive control while the reaction in presence of BSA and <sc>d</sc>-glutamate served as a negative control. Glutamate racemases are known to employ two active-site cysteine residues as acid/base catalysts during the interconversion of glutamate enantiomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). MMTS was used to modify the cysteine residues of <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> MurI. MMTS-treated MurI was compromised in its racemization function revealing the importance of cysteine residues in catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The racemase activity of the enzyme was also monitored by circular dichroism spectra at 204 nm (data not shown). The results showed that <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> MurI racemization activity does not require any peptidoglycan precursor, similar to <italic>B.subtilis</italic> glutamate racemases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). As with other glutamate racemases, the activity is also independent of cofactor requirement.</p></sec><sec><title>MurI inhibits DNA gyrase activity</title><p>In order to test the effect of MurI on supercoiling activity, <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> DNA gyrase was preincubated with MurI for 15 min on ice prior to the addition of DNA substrate (relaxed pUC18) as described in the Materials and Methods section. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> show that MurI inhibits supercoiling activity of mycobacterial DNA gyrase. When its effect on <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA gyrase was tested, mycobacterial MurI was observed to inhibit even the <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The inhibition of DNA gyrase by MurI is thus not species-specific in contrast to other proteinaceous inhibitors such as CcdB, microcin B17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p><p>Apart from the supercoiling reaction, DNA gyrase is known to catalyze other reactions <italic>in vitro</italic>, namely ATP-independent relaxation and decatenation reactions. To analyze the effect of MurI on gyrase-catalyzed relaxation, DNA gyrase was preincubated with MurI prior to the addition of supercoiled pBR322 DNA substrate. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, MurI inhibited the relaxation activity as well. To monitor its effect on the decatenation activity of DNA gyrase, the reactions were carried out using the catenated kinetoplast DNA as substrate. From the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, it is evident that MurI inhibited decatenation activity of DNA gyrase as well. Since all the three catalytic activities of DNA gyrase are inhibited by <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> MurI, a step common to all these processes is likely to be the target for MurI action.</p></sec><sec><title>MurI has no effect on the topoisomerase I activity</title><p>Bacterial topoisomerase I relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA in an ATP-independent manner. In order to assess the effect of MurI on the relaxation activity of topoisomerase I, both <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> as well as <italic>E.coli</italic> topoisomerase I were preincubated with MurI and then supercoiled pUC18 DNA substrate was added for the relaxation assays as described in the Materials and Methods section. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, the topoisomerase I-mediated relaxation reactions were not inhibited in presence of MurI. Therefore, MurI appears to be a specific inhibitor of DNA gyrase.</p></sec><sec><title>Probing the mechanism of inhibition</title><p>The reaction cycle of DNA gyrase involves a series of coordinated steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). After initial wrapping of DNA around the A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub> complex, cleavage of the G segment DNA in both the strands results in the formation of a DNA&#x02013;protein covalent complex. Cleavage reaction is followed by the passage of an intact duplex T segment DNA through the double-stranded break. Religation of the broken ends of DNA after the strand passage results in the introduction of two negative supercoils. Hydrolysis of ATP is required to reset the reaction cycle for catalytic enzyme turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Inhibitors for DNA gyrase, thus, could potentially interfere at any one of the steps in the gyrase reaction cycle to arrest the chain of events.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of MurI on cleavage reaction</title><p>The quinolone class of DNA gyrase inhibitors (e.g. nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin) inhibit both the supercoiling and relaxation reactions of DNA gyrase. They act by interfering with the rejoining of double-stranded breaks in DNA and promote the rate of double-stranded DNA cleavage by DNA gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). In order to test the effect of mycobacterial MurI at the cleavage step, DNA gyrase was preincubated with MurI and the cleavage assays were performed both with the supercoiled plasmid DNA as well as the radiolabelled linear DNA substrates. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, effect of MurI on DNA gyrase-mediated cleavage has been summarized. Unlike ciprofloxacin, MurI did not stimulate DNA gyrase-mediated cleavage on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 6). Ciprofloxacin is known to arrest DNA gyrase at the cleavage step. SDS and proteinase K treatment removes the covalently attached protein and cleaved DNA fragment can be visualized on the gel. The extent of ciprofloxacin-induced cleavage on a supercoiled plasmid DNA substrate was monitored either in absence or presence of MurI. The drug-induced DNA cleavage was reduced in presence of MurI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;8). MurI also abrogated the cleavage even on a linear DNA substrate, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) ions inhibit the religation and known to stimulate DNA cleavage activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). MurI exhibited a similar inhibitory effect on calcium-induced cleavage reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). From these observations, we conclude that MurI inhibits DNA gyrase by interfering with the DNA cleavage reaction or a step preceding it.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of MurI on DNA-binding</title><p>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were employed to assess the effect of MurI on gyrase&#x02013;DNA interaction. To monitor the effect of MurI on both the non-covalent and covalent gyrase&#x02013;DNA complex formation, reactions were performed as described, either in absence or presence of ciprofloxacin and DNA gyrase was preincubated with MurI prior to the addition of DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the amount of retarded gyrase&#x02013;DNA non-covalent complex on the polyacrylamide gel was significantly reduced in presence of MurI, with concomitant increase in the free DNA species. MurI inhibited the formation of non-covalent enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the covalent gyrase&#x02013;DNA complex formation was hindered by MurI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). From these results, it appears that by preventing gyrase&#x02013;DNA interactions, <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> MurI inhibits all the catalytic reactions of DNA gyrase.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of MurI on ATPase activity</title><p>GyrB subunit of DNA gyrase exhibits intrinsic ATPase activity, which is further enhanced in presence of GyrA and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Coumarins and cyclothialidines inhibit supercoiling activity of the enzyme by interfering with ATPase activity (intrinsic as well as DNA-stimulated). If DNA-binding by gyrase is indeed the target of MurI action, the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of the enzyme would be affected while its intrinsic activity would be unaltered. Reactions were carried out with DNA gyrase holoenzyme in presence of linear DNA substrate as described in the Materials and Methods section. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, MurI inhibited the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of DNA gyrase. To test the effect of MurI on intrinsic ATPase activity, reactions were carried out with prior incubation of MurI and only GyrB subunit. MurI had no effect on intrinsic ATPase activity of the enzyme, in contrast to the pattern observed with novobiocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that the MurI mode of inhibition is distinct from that of the ATPase inhibitors. These results also confirm that the inhibition of gyrase by MurI is at the step of DNA-binding.</p></sec><sec><title>MurI interacts with GyrA subunit of DNA gyrase</title><p>To investigate whether MurI-mediated inhibition is mediated by direct interaction between the two proteins, two experimental approaches were employed. In the far-western analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, upon co-incubation of immobilized MurI on the membrane with GyrA subunit, we detected a signal for GyrA at the position of MurI on the membrane. Similar analysis with GyrB subunit did not give any positive signal. In order to verify further the direct interaction, surface plasmon resonance reftractrometric (SPR) studies were performed. SPR experiments also revealed a direct interaction between MurI and GyrA subunit of DNA gyrase, with an increase of 60&#x02013;70 RU upon binding of MurI to immobilized GyrA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The physical interaction between MurI and DNA gyrase is therefore independent of the presence of GyrB subunit, DNA and ATP.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Mycobacterial glutamate racemase exhibits a dual role like its <italic>E.coli</italic> homologue. However, unlike the <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme, mycobacterial MurI inhibits DNA gyrase in a precursor independent manner. In this respect, it is similar to the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> glutamate racemase, which affects DNA gyrase activity in absence of any precursor. Previous studies with <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> enzymes have not addressed the mechanism of inhibition of gyrase by glutamate racemase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of gyrase by MurI is not species-specific. We have then investigated the mechanism of MurI-mediated inhibition of DNA gyrase. It binds to GyrA subunit and this interaction prevents gyrase from accessing the DNA substrate, thereby inhibiting all its catalytic reactions.</p><p>DNA gyrase is responsible for the maintenance of steady-state levels of negative supercoiling that is essential for chromosome condensation, transcription initiation and enzyme complex movement during replication and transcription. By virtue of being an essential enzyme, it is an ideal target for different classes of inhibitors. Amongst a large repertoire of the gyrase inhibitors, coumarins and quinolones have been studied extensively with respect to their mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). A noteworthy point is that new inhibitors with different mechanism of action are often discovered for DNA gyrase. Recently, a new class of antibiotics with an aminocoumarin moiety in its structure has been reported to inhibit gyrase in a mode distinct from the other known coumarins. Simocyclinone D8 inhibits an early step in gyrase catalytic cycle by preventing DNA-binding by the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Several proteinaceous inhibitors of DNA gyrase, discovered so far, could be categorized into two major groups. The first category includes the toxins like CcdB, microcin B17, ParE, which are encoded by the selfish plasmids to ensure their stable maintenance inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). These toxins act as gyrase poisons and their mode of inhibition is akin to that of quinolones but not identical in all the details. The second group of inhibitors includes the chromosomally encoded inhibitors such as GyrI, MfpA and plasmid encoded Qnr. The quinolone resistance protein, Qnr, discovered from a clinical isolate of <italic>Klebsiella pnemoniae</italic>, binds gyrase holoenzyme thereby altering its DNA-binding property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Based on the crystal structure of MfpA, it is considered to be a DNA mimic, sequestering gyrase away from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). GyrI, an endogenous DNA gyrase inhibitor from <italic>E.coli</italic> binds to the holoenzyme and hinders the DNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). None of these proteins are cytotoxic as their mode of inhibition is to prevent DNA gyrase from binding to DNA. Cytotoxicity usually arises due to accumulation of double-strand breaks in the genome. Bacterial cells tolerate some reduction of gyrase activity, whereas only few double-strand breaks in the genome could be lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). In this context, amongst all the inhibitors of DNA gyrase studied so far, quinolones, which form toxic lesions, are the only commercially successful chemical entities.</p><p>From the present studies, it is clear that MurI mode of action resembles the other chromosomally encoded gyrase inhibitors. These inhibitors essentially influence the enzyme activity by sequestering the enzyme away from DNA. A comparative analysis of these proteinaceous inhibitors does not reveal a common motif or structural fold, which might be involved in their ability to inhibit DNA gyrase. Thus, at present, it appears that they belong to a group of very disparate proteins having a similar function as far as gyrase inhibition is concerned.</p><p>Apparently, presence of such endogenous inhibitors of an essential enzyme appears to be a severe burden for the cell. The intracellular optimal activity of DNA gyrase is very crucial for cell survival. These endogenous gyrase inhibitory proteins might be playing a role in regulating DNA gyrase activity. For example, in case of thioredoxins (TrxA and TrxC) from <italic>Rhodobacter sp.</italic>, a change in oxygen tension influences their redox state, resulting in altered gyrase activity which in turn infuences the expression of <italic>puf</italic> and <italic>puc</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). GyrI in <italic>E.coli</italic> acts as an antidote to the plasmid encoded toxin microcin B17 and also involved in reducing DNA damages from diverse agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>).</p><p>Glutamate racemase is the new member of chromosomally encoded gyrase inhibitors. Like others, it appears to sequester away DNA gyrase from its site of action. The physiological basis for MurI-mediated inhibition is not known. Since, mycobacterial MurI inhibits gyrase in absence of any peptidoglycan precursor; its expression would have to be under strict control to avoid any abnormality resulting from uncontrolled inhibition of gyrase. <italic>E.coli</italic> MurI is active and capable of inhibiting DNA gyrase, only upon accumulation of the peptidoglycan precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The gyrase inhibitory YrpC from <italic>B.subtilis</italic> is also poorly expressed in comparison to Glr, which is abundantly expressed but has no influence on DNA gyrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). When cell wall synthesis and chromosome segregation go hand in hand during cell division, gyrase activity may need to be controlled. The observed bifunctionality of the glutamate racemase might be a measure employed by the cell to avoid excess gyrase activity, rather than inhibiting gyrase in true sense. MurI-mediated modulation might be occurring transiently at the time of cell division to coordinate the process of cell wall biosynthesis and DNA replication.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank A.

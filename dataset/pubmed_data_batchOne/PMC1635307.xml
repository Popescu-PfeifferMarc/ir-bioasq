Their mode of replication and abundance favour the notion that they are major actors in eukaryote evolution. The Gypsy retroelement can spread in the germ line of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> via both <italic>env-</italic>independent and <italic>env</italic>-dependent processes. Thus, Gypsy is both an active retrotransposon and an infectious retrovirus resembling the gammaretrovirus MuLV. However, unlike gammaretroviruses, the Gypsy Gag structural precursor is not processed into Matrix, Capsid and Nucleocapsid (NC) proteins. In contrast, it has features in common with Gag of the ancient yeast TY1 retroelement. These characteristics of Gypsy make it a very interesting model to study replication of a retroelement at the frontier between ancient retrotransposons and retroviruses. We investigated Gypsy replication using an <italic>in vitro</italic> model system and transfection of insect cells. Results show that an unstructured domain of Gypsy Gag has all the properties of a retroviral NC. This NC-like peptide forms ribonucleoparticle-like complexes upon binding Gypsy RNA and directs the annealing of primer tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> to two distinct primer binding sites (PBS) at the genome 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends. Only the 5&#x02032; PBS is indispensable for cDNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Retrotransposons and retroviruses belong to a large family of mobile genetic elements called long terminal repeat (LTR) containing retroelements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Ancient retrotransposons, such as yeast transposons (TY) share common genetic features with simple retroviruses, such as vertebrate gammaretroviruses and utilize similar basic mechanisms for their replication. Genome replication proceeds via the conversion of the single-stranded genomic RNA into a double-stranded DNA copy with two LTRs by reverse transcriptase (RT), followed by integration into the host genome by integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). By virtue of this copy-and-paste mechanism, retrotransposons are thought to have efficiently invaded eukaryotic genomes. Being a large part of eukaryotic genomes, these LTR-retroelements are viewed as major players in eukaryote evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>).</p><p>A large number of studies on the early replication steps of lentiviruses and gammaretroviruses, such as HIV-1 and MoMuLV, respectively, have been carried out in <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted systems and in cell culture [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>)]. Collectively the findings show that reverse transcription occurs within the virion nucleocapsid (NC) structure formed of the genomic RNA coated by molecules of NC protein, and starts by NC-mediated annealing of a specific cellular primer tRNA to a unique 5&#x02032; genomic primer binding site (PBS), followed by RT-directed cDNA synthesis during which RT is assisted by NC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Much less studies have been carried out on the early replication steps of ancient retrotransposons, such as TYs of yeast. Although a similar basic mechanism appears to operate, such as RT-directed cDNA synthesis by extension of a specific cellular tRNA annealed to a genomic PBS within a ribonucleoprotein structure, several important differences were discovered. The genomic PBS is not unique but multipartite in TY1 and TY3, and unique genomic 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; interactions appear to exert a control over reverse transcription and consequently on the genetic amplification of these retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>As it is well documented for HIV-1, NC protein in its mature form plays critical roles in the conversion of the genomic RNA into proviral DNA by RT through specific and tight interactions with the genomic RNA, primer tRNA<sup>Lys,3</sup>, RT and the newly made cDNA [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>)]. Interestingly, retrotransposon NC proteins can either contain a canonical CCHC zinc finger RNA-binding motif and be processed by protease cleavage of the Gag polyprotein, such as in TY3, or else Gag is not processed and does not contain a zinc finger motif, such as in TY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Nevertheless, the retroviral NC functions appear to be conserved in these retrotransposons since the C-terminal region of TY1 Gag chaperones the annealing of primer tRNA<sup>Met,i</sup> to the 5&#x02032; multipartite PBS, mediates TY1 RNA dimerization, and assists cDNA synthesis by the homologous RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Gypsy is a retroelement present in the germ line of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and can spread via cell-free viral infection. Thus, Gypsy can be considered both as an active retrotransposon and an infectious retrovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In agreement with this notion, the genetic structure of Gypsy is similar to that of the murine gammaretrovirus MuLV with Gag, Pol and Env flanked by two LTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). However, the Gypsy Gag structural protein is not processed into Matrix, Capsid and NC proteins (B.V. Syomin and A. Pelisson, unpublished data), which is reminiscent of Gag of the yeast TY1.</p><p>These functional and genetic features of Gypsy make it a very attractive model to study replication of a mobile genetic element, which is at the frontier between ancient retrotransposons and retroviruses. To that end we set up an <italic>in vitro</italic> replication system using Gypsy RNAs representing the genomic RNA 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions, and cellular primer tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup>, and investigated their interactions with a putative NC-like domain in Gag. Here we report that an unstructured domain of Gypsy Gag has the hallmarks of an active retroviral NC. This NC-like domain forms ribonucleoparticle-like complexes upon binding Gypsy RNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, two distinct primer tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> binding sites of 11 nt were identified at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the genome. We also found that the Gypsy NC-like peptide can direct the annealing of tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> to these Gypsy PBSs but only the 5&#x02032; PBS appears to be indispensable for cDNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><sec><title>Template DNA pBSG8</title><p>The XhoI fragment (&#x02212;39 to 6949) of Gypsy DNA (GenBank accession no.

Indeed the Gag C-terminal domain of TY1 possesses nucleic acid binding and chaperoning properties, promoting replication primer tRNA<sup>Met,i</sup> annealing to the RNA genome and initiation of cDNA synthesis by RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Since NC activity appears to be ubiquitous in functional retroelements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), we decided to search for an NC-like domain in Gypsy Gag (ORF1). Owing to the absence of a consensus RNA-binding motif or considerable homology to known NC proteins [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and data not shown], we took advantage of physico-chemical features probably shared by all NC and NC-like proteins.</p><p>The regions flanking the zinc fingers in NC proteins contain low amino acid complexity regions and are rich in proline and basic amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Proline and charged amino acids as well as low complexity were suggested to contribute to the flexibility of a polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Indeed, the solution structures of NCp7 and NCp10 show that these proteins&#x02014;with the exception of the short zinc finger region(s) (see Materials and Methods)&#x02014;are poorly structured when not bound to nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). This flexibility (i.e. intrinsic disorder) might be an important prerequisite both for the multimerization of NC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and for their RNA chaperone function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Based on these considerations, we propose that the presence of a markedly basic, disordered region in retroviral/retroelement Gag may be a good indicator of NC function in the absence of well characterized RNA-binding domain(s) with CCHC zinc fingers.</p><p>Relatively long unstructured regions can be predicted from amino acid sequence with considerable accuracy. We used the DisProt VL3-H predictor [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ist.temple.edu/disprot/predictor.php"/>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>)] to assess the probability of disorder in Gypsy Gag. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the N-terminal and central regions of Gag are predicted to be mostly ordered and do not show a distinctive basic character. However, an approximately 100 amino acid region at the C-terminal end of Gag (between 300 and 400 amino acid) contains predominantly basic amino acid clusters in a putatively disordered environment, a pattern characteristic of retroviral NC proteins [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) and data not shown]. In agreement with this prediction, an arginine-rich region (355&#x02013;389 amino acid) has been previously proposed to act as a possible RNA-binding domain of Gypsy Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>The Gag region encompassing residues 289&#x02013;404 was PCR-amplified and cloned into the pIVEX2.4d vector. The corresponding peptide was found to be toxic in <italic>E.coli</italic> and to aggregate (data not shown). To circumvent these difficulties it was necessary to express the peptide at 18&#x000b0;C. Due to a very low level of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 1) we had to insert a His-tag at the N-terminus in order to achieve an efficient purification and to obtain a peptide at about 95% purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 2). This Gypsy Gag peptide was found to bind Gypsy RNA and tRNA with a high affinity similar to the NC-like peptide derived from the yeast retrotransposon TY1 Gag, termed TYA1-D (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (data not shown). This prompted us to investigate its RNA condensing and chaperoning properties using <italic>in vitro</italic> generated RNAs mimicking the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions of the Gypsy genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The Gypsy NC peptide has RNA-binding and condensing properties</title><p>One hallmark of viral RNA chaperone proteins, such as retroviral NC proteins is that they cause RNA aggregation and condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).

To analyse the ability of Gypsy NC to form large ribonucleoproteins, Gypsy NC&#x02013;<sup>32</sup>P-RNA complexes were formed at 30&#x000b0;C and recovered by centrifugation at 13&#x02009;000 r.p.m. (see Materials and Methods). Radioactivity in the supernatant and in the nucleoprotein-containing pellet was monitored. Results show that the Gypsy NC (G-NC) caused RNA condensation at a protein to nucleotide molar ratio of 1:6, both with the Gypsy 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). At a protein to nt molar ratio of 1:12, 50&#x02013;60% of the RNA was found in nucleoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) in agreement with the fact that about half of the Gypsy <sup>32</sup>P-RNA was bound to Gypsy NC as indicated by gel retardation assays (data not shown). The TYA1-D peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) was used as a positive control and, as expected, had a similar RNA condensing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The observed RNA aggregation cannot be exclusively attributed to charge neutralization caused by the basic amino acids in Gypsy NC (pI = 10.46) and TYA1-D (pI = 10.24), since the similarly basic MLV-NC and HIV-1 NC peptides (with pI values of 10.2 and 9.42, respectively) failed to induce considerable RNA aggregation of the Gypsy 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; MLV and HIV-NC bars).</p></sec><sec><title>The Gypsy NC peptide directs annealing of tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> to two 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; PBSs</title><p>In order to set up an <italic>in vitro</italic> Gypsy replication system, we needed to know whether the 5&#x02032; PBS was unique, bipartite or multipartite as in retroviruses and in the yeast retrotransposons TY3 and TY1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Sequence alignments using tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> and the complete Gypsy sequences were performed. As reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, a PBS of 11 nt in length and rich in GC is located immediately 3&#x02032; of the 5&#x02032; LTR at positions 245&#x02013;255, complementary to the 3&#x02032; end of the tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> acceptor stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, another putative tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> binding site was found close to the genomic RNA 3&#x02032; end at positions 6489 to 6499, also 11 nt in length and rich in GC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This second PBS is complementary to a different region of tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup>, namely part of the anticodon and T&#x003a8;C stems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To assess the role of these 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; PBSs in primer tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> annealing and initiation of reverse transcription, we generated several different RNAs mimicking the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions of Gypsy genomic RNA containing the wild-type sequences, or a deleted PBS, and recombinant RNAs where the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions have been fused in the wild-type sequence context or containing either one or both deleted PBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; see Gypsy RNAs named BSG8-CG 1 to 9).</p><p>To examine primer tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> annealing to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; PBSs we used the 5&#x02032;, 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; Gypsy RNAs generated <italic>in vitro</italic> (see Materials and Methods, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The Gypsy NC (G-NC) or the TYA1-D peptide was added to the assays together with <sup>32</sup>P-labelled tRNA. At the end of the incubation period, <sup>32</sup>P-labelled nucleic acids were purified by proteinase K (PK) digestion and phenol extraction, and subsequently analysed by gel electrophoresis in native conditions followed by autoradiography. As reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, the Gypsy NC and TYA1-D peptides promoted extensive annealing of tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> to the 5&#x02032; PBS (lanes 2&#x02013;7) and, as expected, not to the 5&#x02032; RNA lacking the PBS (lanes 13&#x02013;14). Both peptides also chaperoned the annealing of tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> to the 3&#x02032; PBS, but somewhat less efficiently than to the 5&#x02032; PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;7). Despite many attempts, the level of tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> annealing to the 3&#x02032; PBS never reached more than 30&#x02013;40% with TYA1-D and 40&#x02013;60% with Gypsy NC as compared with the 5&#x02032; PBS. As expected, in the absence of 3&#x02032; PBS no tRNA annealing took place (lanes 13&#x02013;14). At the same time, the MLV and HIV-NC peptides were found to be poorly active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, lanes 8&#x02013;11) although they contain zinc fingers shown to specify direct NC/RNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>We used a recombinant 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; RNA representing the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions of the Gypsy genomic RNA to better understand what could be the interactions between the 5&#x02032; PBS&#x02013;tRNA and the 3&#x02032; PBS&#x02013;tRNA complexes since different tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> sequences of 11 nt should be base paired to the Gypsy 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; PBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), thus possibly forming a link between the ends of Gypsy genomic RNA in a manner similar to yeast TY3 RNA and primer tRNA<sup>Met,i</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Overall, the Gypsy NC and TYA1-D peptides still directed tRNA annealing to the PBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5 and 20&#x02013;25). Deleting the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; PBS did not result in levels of tRNA annealing to the 5&#x02032; PBS or 3&#x02032; PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;10 and 12&#x02013;15, respectively) similar to those obtained with the 3&#x02032; RNA or 5&#x02032; RNA alone (compare with wt RNAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). As before, the MLV and HIV-NC peptides were inactive (lanes 26&#x02013;29). Taken together, these results indicate that complex interactions are probably taking place between Gypsy 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; terminal regions, probably competing with the binding to tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup>.</p><p>To investigate how tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> could possibly establish a bridge between the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the Gypsy genomic RNA, we analysed the simultaneous binding of tRNA to the PBSs situated on two RNA molecules. To this end, Gypsy 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RNAs were co-incubated with tRNA and the TYA1-D or Gypsy NC peptide. After peptide removal by SDS-proteinase K digestion and phenol extraction, RNAs were subjected to electrophoresis in native conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, an RNA complex formed of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RNAs, and tRNA was generated upon addition of TYA1-D or G-NC in a dose dependent manner (lanes 2&#x02013;5) when both PBSs were present. However, this complex did not form upon deleting the PBS from the 3&#x02032; RNA (lanes 7&#x02013;10). Similar results were obtained with the Gypsy 5&#x02032; RNA with a deleted PBS (data not shown). These results indicate that the Gypsy primer tRNA can establish a bridge between the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the genomic RNA (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of the Gypsy NC peptide on cDNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To examine the influence of the Gypsy NC peptide and the role of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; PBSs on Gypsy cDNA synthesis, we used the 5&#x02032;, 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; RNAs as well as the PBS-mutated RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Reverse transcription by the related MLV RT proceeded at 30&#x000b0;C for 1 h, after which cDNAs were recovered by SDS-PK treatment and phenol extraction, and analysed by gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions (see Materials and Methods). The Gypsy NC and TYA1-D peptides directed tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> hybridization to the 5&#x02032; PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) that allowed strong stop cDNA (ss-cDNA) synthesis by RT using the 5&#x02032; RNA template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;7). In the absence of NC peptide no ss-cDNA was made, in agreement with the fact that little or no primer tRNA was annealed to the 5&#x02032; PBS (lane 1). Since tRNA annealing to the 3&#x02032; PBS did not involve its 3&#x02032; terminal nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), no cDNA was synthesized using the 3&#x02032; RNA (lanes 9&#x02013;10).</p><p>We next examined the influence of the 3&#x02032; PBS on ss-cDNA synthesis initiated at the 5&#x02032; PBS using the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; RNA template. Results were very similar to the previous ones since only the 5&#x02032; PBS was capable of directing ss-cDNA synthesis by RT (compare lanes 15&#x02013;17 and 20) with only a little influence of the 3&#x02032; PBS (compare lanes 15&#x02013;17 and 25&#x02013;27). However, only the Gypsy NC peptide was effective at stimulating cDNA synthesis using the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; RNA template (compare lanes 12&#x02013;14 and 15&#x02013;17). Similar results were obtained upon mixing the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RNA templates (data not shown). Both the TYA1-D and Gypsy NC peptides were found to strongly inhibit cDNA synthesis by self-priming (Supplementary Figure 1), which further support the specific role of NC protein in proviral DNA synthesis in most, if not all retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Gypsy cDNA synthesis in <italic>D.hydei</italic> cells</title><p>Lyubomirskaya <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) have developed a simple <italic>ex vivo</italic> assay to look for Gypsy cDNA synthesis, which allows the direct detection of Gypsy reverse transcription by Southern blotting in stably transformed Dh14 cells. These <italic>D.hydei</italic> cells were chosen because their genome does not cross-hybridize with the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> Gypsy sequences. The rationale of this assay is that a small 5&#x02032; end deletion in a LTR retroelement still allows the production of a full-length transcript, which is subsequently used as a template to generate a complete cDNA with a restriction map different from that of the deleted donor DNA. This assay benefited here from a slight modification of the donor plasmid where a strong enhancer sequence from the copia retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) was inserted upstream of the Gypsy promoter, replacing the U3 sequence from the 5&#x02032; LTR (see Materials and Methods). To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, we took advantage of the fact that the donor plasmid DNA was of prokaryotic origin and could be selectively degraded into small DNA fragments by the DpnI enzyme. The newly made cDNA and a minority of the parental DNA, which happened to have replicated in these Dh cells, are devoid of the methylation tags and are therefore resistant to DpnI.</p><p>The results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (lanes 5&#x02013;8, WT) show that the unintegrated cDNA products, i.e. the linear and both the 1-LTR and 2-LTR circles, were found by Southern blotting as early as three days after transfection. To investigate the role of the 5&#x02032; PBS we constructed a &#x00394;5&#x02032; PBS mutant producing a genomic RNA missing the 11 nt, which hybridize to the 3&#x02032; terminus of primer tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup>. Using Gypsy anti-Gag and anti-Env antibodies, we showed by western immuno-blotting of cellular protein extracts that this 5&#x02032; PBS deletion did not affect Gypsy protein expression (data not shown). Results show that only the mutant donor plasmid DNA was detected by Southern blotting, clearly indicating that the 5&#x02032; PBS is required for Gypsy cDNA synthesis. This is also in complete agreement with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, lanes 17 and 20). A smaller 5&#x02032; PBS deletion has been made (see Materials and Methods) and results confirmed that the 5&#x02032; PBS is essential for Gypsy cDNA synthesis <italic>ex vivo</italic> (data not shown).</p><p>Next, we constructed the &#x00394;3&#x02032; PBS mutant by deleting nt 6727&#x02013;6737 (Materials and Methods). This &#x00394;3&#x02032; PBS mutant displayed a wild-type level of cDNA made (compare lanes 1&#x02013;2 with 5&#x02013;6, and 11&#x02013;12 with 7&#x02013;8) despite the fact that it does not produce any envelope protein due to the frameshift generated by this 11 nt deletion at the Env 3&#x02032; end (data not shown). To further address the role of Gag in the synthesis of Gypsy cDNA, we inserted a frameshift mutation at the 5&#x02032; end of Gag. This Gypsy mutant that cannot express the Gag protein was totally unable to direct cDNA synthesis (data not shown). In conclusion, these results confirm the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; lanes 17 and 27) and show that the 3&#x02032; PBS is not required for cDNA synthesis, at least at this stage of Gypsy replication.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> Gypsy retroelement has a genetic organization similar to that of the widespread vertebrate gammaretroviruses, such as the MLV. In fact the provirus form of Gypsy contains the three canonical open reading frames <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic> flanked by two LTRs. As an infectious enveloped retrovirus, Gypsy can efficiently invade the germ line of permissive flies, upon infection of naive females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). These new Gypsy proviruses can then increase their number by expression in the somatic cells of permissive <italic>flamenco</italic> females followed by recurrent invasion of the germ line by a process, which, in contrast to virus infection, does not need env (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Thus, Gypsy can behave both as an infectious retrovirus and as an active retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>A high level of Gypsy transposition might be deleterious for the host genome due to insertional mutagenesis, especially because Gypsy carries a strong DNA insulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), which can disrupt the activity of the genes, into which it is integrated by blocking the interactions of distal enhancers with the target promoter. Thus, the inability of Gypsy to extensively invade the genome is conditioned by the cell capacity to repress this retroelement. This control results in reduced steady state levels of Gypsy transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Moreover, it has recently been shown that synthesis of Gypsy Gag is strictly controlled at the translational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>).</p><p>To understand the dual nature of the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> Gypsy and the fact that it appears to be at the frontier between retrotransposons of yeast and simple vertebrate retroviruses, we investigated Gypsy replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cell culture. First, we searched for a NC-like region in Gypsy Gag with all the properties of a bona fide retroviral RNA chaperone protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>)]. To this end, we used a computer-assisted search to look for a peptide domain of low complexity, rich in proline and basic residues, and with a predicted disordered state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Such a peptide domain, named G-NC, was found at the C-terminal end of the Gypsy Gag, showing notable similarities with the NC-like domain of TY1 Gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). In fact, the Gypsy NC-like peptide was active in the formation of high molecular weight nucleoprotein complexes and in replication primer annealing to the genomic PBS in a manner very similar to that of the C-terminal Gag peptide of yeast TY1 (TYA1-D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Like other retroviral NC proteins, the G-NC peptide was found to possess general RNA chaperoning properties <italic>in vitro</italic>, which can promote profound rearrangements of nucleic acid conformation [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>)]. Along this line, the optimal chaperoning activity of G-NC takes place at a peptide to nucleic acid molar ratio of one peptide per 6 to 10 nt (see Figure 6) as holds true for retroviral NC proteins and NC of the yeast TY3 retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Interestingly, NCp9 of TY3 was found to be active in the Gypsy system (data not shown) whereas the basic MLV and HIV-1 NC peptides were poorly active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) although they contain zinc fingers shown to specify direct NC&#x02013;RNA interactions in HIV and MLV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The primary structure of the Gypsy Gag and the presence of an active RNA chaperoning domain at its C-terminus suggest that the Gypsy Gag resembles more that of an ancient retrotransposon than the canonical Gag of the gammaretrovirus MLV, formed of the well-defined matrix, capsid and NC domains. On the opposite the Gypsy genomic RNA has long structured untranslated regions, the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-untranslated regions (UTRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) similar to the MLV genomic RNA. In addition, the Gypsy 5&#x02032;-UTR directs translation of Gag and Env via specific internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) that resemble the MLV Gag and Env IRESes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>).</p><p>Second, we characterized two distinct PBSs located at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the Gypsy genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which are reminiscent of those found in the yeast TY3 retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The G-NC peptide promoted the annealing of primer tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> to both the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; PBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, the simultaneous annealing of primer tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> to these two PBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) resulted in the formation of a 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; RNA complex, indicating that a tRNA bridge can possibly generate a circular Gypsy RNA as proposed for the TY3 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). However, Gypsy differs from TY3 since the 3&#x02032; PBS is not implicated in the process of cDNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Yet the exact role of the Gypsy 3&#x02032; PBS could be at the level of genome maintenance or translation via formation of a circular RNA. This is presently under investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, these findings on the NC-like domain of Gypsy Gag and on the existence of two PBSs indicate that Gypsy resembles active retrotransposons and is distinct from canonical simple retroviruses, such as the MLVs and avian leukosis viruses. In agreement with this conclusion, the <italic>env</italic>-independent reverse transcription of Gypsy in <italic>D.hydei</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) is reminiscent of the fact that the efficiency of Gypsy replication in <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> females was not affected by the frameshift disruption of the <italic>env</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). On the other hand, the presence of a single 5&#x02032; PBS necessary for cDNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), of long structured UTRs, of functional IRESes and Env, and the fact that cell-free Gypsy particles are infectious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) indicate that Gypsy should be considered as an ancient simple retrovirus, similar to the gammaretrovirus MLV. To investigate how much the NC functions are conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gypsy to the MLV, substituting MLV-NC by the Gypsy NC-like is now in progress using MLV-based vectors.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Marc Ruff (Strasbourg) for helpful advice on peptide expression and purification procedures.

The bar chart illustrates the charge distribution of amino acids in Gypsy Gag (ORF1), as calculated by the charge function of the EMBOSS package, using default parameters and a sliding window of 5 amino acids. Computer prediction of disordered regions (solid line) was obtained using the DisProt VL3-H predictor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ist.temple.edu/disprot/predictor.php"/>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).

The C-terminal part of ORF1 contains several basic amino acid clusters and is predicted to be disordered in its unliganded state, a common feature of retroelement NC proteins (see text for explanation).

Control Gypsy RNAs with <sup>32</sup>P-tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> but without protein are shown in lanes 1 and 6. TYA1-D or Gypsy NC (G-NC) peptide was added to the assays at protein to nucleotide molar ratios of 1:15 and 1:7 as shown in lanes 2&#x02013;3, 4&#x02013;5, 7&#x02013;8 and 9&#x02013;10, respectively.

Note that annealing of tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> to both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; PBS caused the formation of a complex made of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; Gypsy RNAs and tRNA (lanes 4&#x02013;5) but not when tRNA could not anneal to the 3&#x02032; RNA (lanes 9&#x02013;10).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl722f7"/></fig><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Role of the Gypsy NC peptide in cDNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the initiation of reverse transcription on Gypsy 5&#x02032; RNA. Reverse transcription of Gypsy 5&#x02032; U5 and R RNA sequences leads to the synthesis of the so-called minus strand strong stop cDNA, ss-cDNA(&#x02212;), by RT extension of primer tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup>.

MLV RT was added together with dNTPs to allow reverse transcription. Assays were processed as described in Materials and Methods and ss-cDNA(&#x02212;) was denatured and analysed by 10% PAGE in 7 M urea. Controls without protein are shown in lanes 1, 8, 11, 18 and 21. Protein to RNA nucleotide molar ratios were 1:48 (lanes 2, 5, 12, 15, 22 and 25), 1:24 (lanes 3, 6, 13, 16, 23 and 26) and 1:12 (lanes 4, 7, 9, 10, 14, 17, 19, 20, 24 and 27), corresponding to 1.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>, 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> and 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M for 5&#x02032; RNA and 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>, 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M for 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; RNA. Note that hybridization of tRNA<sup>Lys,2</sup> to the 3&#x02032; PBS caused an inhibition of the initiation of Gypsy reverse transcription which was severe with the TYA1-D peptide (compare lanes 2&#x02013;4 with 12&#x02013;14) and moderate with the homologous peptide (compare lanes 5&#x02013;7 with 15&#x02013;17).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl722f8"/></fig><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>The 5&#x02032; PBS is critical for Gypsy cDNA synthesis <italic>ex vivo</italic>. <italic>D.hydei</italic> cells were transfected with WT or PBS-mutated Gypsy DNA as reported in materials and methods. The 10.3 kb transfected DNA is shown at the top. The dotted line represents the vector DNA that was used to clone the Gypsy element with a complete 3&#x02032; LTR (rectangle with P, a PvuI site) and a shortened 5&#x02032; LTR (square) the U3 sequence of which was replaced by a Copia enhancer (black box). Reverse transcription is expected to regenerate the missing sequence, giving rise to the full-length 7.5 kb Gypsy DNA shown at the bottom. The 2-LTR and 1-LTR circular DNA products of 7.5 and 7.0 kb, respectively, are shown. A total of 1 &#x003bc;g of total DNA were digested with either EcoRI (R) or NdeI (N), blotted and probed with the fragment schematized at the bottom. A unique band is expected to correspond to each category of molecules. The only exception corresponds to the integrated proviruses (not represented here), which if randomly inserted at various distances from the EcoRI or NdeI genomic restriction sites, are expected to produce a smear corresponding to a heterogeneous population of molecules larger than 6.6 and 5.7 kb, respectively. In contrast, in double digests involving PvuI (P) and either NdeI (N) or EcoRI (R), all types of cDNA products should merge into a single band, as shown in lanes 1, 5, 8 and 12). Most of the transfected plasmids have run out of the gel after being degraded into small DNA fragments by the methylation-dependent DpnI enzyme; therefore, the upper band only corresponds to the minority of plasmids, which have lost these prokaryotic methylation tags. &#x00394;5&#x02032; and &#x00394;3&#x02032; PBS are mutants which only differ from the wild-type Gypsy sequence (WT) by the &#x00394;PBS mutations described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, at positions (proviral DNA sequence) 482&#x02013;492 and 6727&#x02013;6737, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Note that the &#x00394;5&#x02032; PBS, but not the &#x00394;3&#x02032; PBS deletion resulted in the absence of cDNA synthesis (lanes 3&#x02013;4 and 9&#x02013;10).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl722f9"/></fig></sec></back></article>

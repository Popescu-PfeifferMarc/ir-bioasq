This complex forms the so-called &#x02018;L12 stalk&#x02019; on the 50S ribosomal subunit. Ribosomal protein L11 binds to the same region of 23S rRNA and is located at the base of the &#x02018;L12 stalk&#x02019;. The &#x02018;L12 stalk&#x02019; plays a key role in the interaction of the ribosome with translation factors. In this study stalk complexes from mesophilic and (hyper)thermophilic species of the archaeal genus <italic>Methanococcus</italic> and from the Archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>, as well as from the Bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</italic> and <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>, were overproduced in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified under non-denaturing conditions. Using filter-binding assays the affinities of the archaeal and bacterial complexes to their specific 23S rRNA target site were analyzed at different pH, ionic strength and temperature. Affinities of both archaeal and bacterial complexes for 23S rRNA vary by more than two orders of magnitude, correlating very well with the growth temperatures of the organisms. A cooperative effect of binding to 23S rRNA of protein L11 and the L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complex from mesophilic and thermophilic Archaea was shown to be temperature-dependent.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>With a few bacterial exceptions (e.g. <italic>Thermotoga</italic>, <italic>Aquifex</italic> and <italic>Thermus</italic>), all organisms able to grow optimally at or above 75&#x000b0;C are classified within the Archaea. In order to cope with extreme temperature conditions, the intrinsic stability of all macromolecular cell components must be increased in thermophilic organisms. Extrinsic factors, such as ions or biogenic amines may serve as stabilizing ligands. To understand protein functions and stability at high temperatures, the proteins from hyperthermophiles are the focus of intense research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The structural features regulating the thermal stability of supermolecular cell structures like ribosomes are less well studied.</p><p>Though the crystal structure of the <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> 30S subunit and 70S ribosome have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), very little is known still about the structural features regulating the inherent thermal stability of ribosomes in thermophiles. The mechanisms involved in thermal stabilization of the ribosome have been investigated in some detail only for the thermophilic archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>. In particular, it was shown that the individual ribosomal components (rRNAs and r-proteins) are less thermostable than the ribosome as a whole. More extensive interactions of r-proteins and rRNAs in thermophiles, compared to mesophilic microorganisms, seem to play an essential role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In thermophiles the rRNAs (and thus the whole ribosome) are stabilized by a higher G + C content of helical rRNA structures, and a striking correlation between G + C content of the RNA stems and the optimal growth temperature has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Moreover, the unusually high base modification levels of 16S and 23S rRNA in thermophiles might contribute to the thermal stabilization of the ribosome as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The importance of base modifications for the thermo-stabilization of tRNAs has been investigated in <italic>Methanococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Primary rRNA-binding proteins from thermophiles exhibit a much higher affinity for their specific rRNA sites compared to their mesophilic counterparts, as has been shown for r-proteins L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), S8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and S7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). This strong RNA&#x02013;protein interaction observed for the (hyper)thermophilic complexes might make an important contribution to the thermostability of the ribosome. Analysis of the 3D structure of <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> 30S subunit revealed some special features of r-proteins enhancing RNA&#x02013;protein affinity, which probably play a role in the stability of the ribosome at high temperatures: e.g. the extra C-terminal helix of TthS17 increasing protein&#x02013;RNA contacts and zinc-binding modules in TthS4 and TthS14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>The archaeal genus <italic>Methanococcus</italic> comprises mesophilic (<italic>Methanococcus maripaludis</italic>, <italic>Methanococcus vannielii</italic>, <italic>Methanococcus voltae</italic>; optimal growth temperature 35&#x000b0;C), thermophilic (<italic>Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus&#x02014;</italic>65&#x000b0;C) and hyperthermophilic (<italic>Methanococcus jannaschii</italic>, <italic>Methanococcus igneus&#x02014;</italic>85&#x02013;88&#x000b0;C) species; for a phylogenetic tree of the genus <italic>Methanococcus</italic> see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Although the optimal growth temperature of the mesophiles is about 50&#x000b0;C below that of the hyperthermophiles, their genomic G + C contents are nearly identical. The genus <italic>Methanococcus</italic> is an ideal model system not only to study mechanisms of thermal adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), but also to investigate the strategies by which RNA-binding proteins fine-tune the affinity for their RNA targets. It was shown earlier that r-proteins L1 and S8 from hyperthermophiles exhibit a 100-fold, and their homologues from thermophiles exhibit a 10-fold, higher affinity for rRNA than their mesophilic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>The L12 stalk is composed of two or three dimers of r-protein L12 (in Bacteria designated L7/L12; L7 is L12, which carries an acetylated N-terminal Ser residue in Bacteria only) and a single copy of r-protein L10 and is located in the large ribosomal subunits from Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya (proteins P0 and P1/P2). L12 is the only ribosomal protein present in more than a single copy per ribosome. The &#x02018;L12 stalk&#x02019; was considered to be a pentameric L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complex in all organisms, but latest studies showed that it is a heptameric L10/L12<sub>6</sub> complex (one molecule of L10 and three L12 dimers) in some thermophilic bacteria [e.g. <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) and <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>)]. The stalk complex bound to 23S rRNA via L10 forms a mobile region (&#x02018;L12 stalk&#x02019;) on the large ribosomal subunit, which is involved in the interaction of the ribosome with elongation factors (where its high conformational mobility is essential). Furthermore, this stalk plays an important role in the control of translational accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>In Bacteria the genes of r-proteins L10 and L12 constitute their own operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and L10 as part of the stalk complex functions as a translational autoregulator of the operon binding to the own mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). However, in Archaea the genes encoding r-proteins L10 and L12 are in tandem as part of the L1 operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and L10 does not have a regulatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>The stalk complex can be easily extracted from the ribosome and it readily reassociates with ribosomal core particles that lack the complex. The complex can be easily reconstituted from isolated L10 and L12. In Bacteria the L12 monomer includes two distinct structural domains linked by a flexible hinge (residues 37&#x02013;52 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>); the elongated &#x003b1;-helical N-terminal domain (residues 1&#x02013;36) is responsible for the dimer formation; the larger globular C-terminal domain (residues 53&#x02013;120) probably interacts with elongation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Both L12 dimers are integrated into the ribosome through binding of their N-terminal domains to L10. L10 binds to a highly conserved target site in domain II of 23S rRNA [1029&#x02013;1125 nt, <italic>E.coli</italic> nomenclature, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>)] close to the GTPase center of the 50S subunit. Intriguingly, archaeal L12 proteins and the eukaryal homologous P1/P2 proteins are shorter than their bacterial counterparts are, whereas L10 proteins from Archaea and P0 proteins from Eukarya have a C-terminal extension (about 80&#x02013;100 amino acid residues), which does not exist in Bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). In Archaea and Eukarya, a high degree of sequence identity is apparent between the C-termini of the respective L10 and L12 proteins. The similarity of the archaeal and eukaryal stalk complexes is underlined by a recent study, which shows that hybrid ribosomes composed of <italic>E.coli</italic> 50S subunits and an archaeal stalk are accessible for archaeal as well as for eukaryotic elongation factors, but not for bacterial elongation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p><p>The L12 stalk is missing on the electron density map of the 50S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) and of the 70S ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) probably due to its very high flexibility. However, the structure and properties of the isolated protein L12 from <italic>E.coli</italic> (EcoL12) have been studied in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) as well as its conformational dynamic in the isolated form and within the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The crystal structures of the L12 monomer and dimer from <italic>T.maritima</italic> (TmaL12) have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). TmaL12 exists in two alternative monomer conformations that might reflect the suggested dynamic role of the protein in the translocation process. The mode of self-association of TmaL12 in solution has been studied in detail using a FRET study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Recently the crystal structure of bacterial TmaL10 in complex with three L12 N-terminal domain dimers was reported and the structure of the N-terminal domain of L10 from <italic>Haloarcula marismortui</italic> (HmaL10) on the 50S subunit was refined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Thus, the last major gap in the 3D structure of the ribosome could be filled.</p><p>Isolated L10 has a much lower rRNA-binding capacity than the L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complex, as shown for the L10 proteins from the mesophilic organisms <italic>E.coli</italic> (EcoL10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) and <italic>M.vannielii</italic> (MvaL10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). In this work, we demonstrated that this also holds true for L10 from the hyperthermophilic <italic>M.jannaschii</italic> (MjaL10).</p><p>In this study we characterized the interaction of a number of stalk complexes from mesophilic and (hyper)thermophilic Archaea (<italic>Methanococcus</italic> species and <italic>S.solfataricus</italic>) and from Bacteria (<italic>E.coli</italic>, <italic>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</italic> (formerly <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic>) and <italic>T.thermophilus</italic>) with their specific 23S rRNA target site at different temperatures, pH values and monovalent cation concentrations. We discovered a significant correlation of the affinity of L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complexes for 23S rRNA with the optimal growth temperature of the organisms. Both archaeal and bacterial stalk complexes from hyperthermophiles exhibit a much higher affinity for 23S rRNA compared to their mesophilic counterparts. Using a new two color fluorescence dye procedure for gel-shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), we also examined a cooperative effect of binding of the r-protein L11 and the L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complex to 23S rRNA. It was shown that this effect for mesophilic and thermophilic proteins is temperature-dependent and correlates with the optimal growth temperature of the organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>To construct the expression plasmids listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> genomic DNA, prepared as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), was used as a template to amplify the genes encoding the r-proteins by PCR, using either an Advantage<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 2 PCR Kit (CLONTECH) or a ProofStart&#x02122; PCR Kit (QIAGEN), both of which provide an antibody-mediated &#x02018;hot start&#x02019; and proofreading activity. The sequences of the relevant genes, available in the PubMed GeneBank or PEDANT genome databases, were used to design the PCR primers (synthesized by Microsynth, Switzerland). To express the r-proteins in <italic>E.coli</italic> the genes were cloned into the high-level expression vector pET11c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). For this purpose, two restriction sites were created by PCR upstream and downstream of the coding sequences. The primer at the 5&#x02032; end of the gene had an NdeI site (including the ATG start codon); the primer at the 3&#x02032; end had a BamHI site downstream of the stop codon. The annealing temperatures for each PCR were optimized individually in the range of 50 to 64&#x000b0;C. NdeI&#x02013;BamHI fragments carrying the genes of r-proteins were inserted in the corresponding sites of pET11c to generate expression plasmids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To overproduce the stalk complexes in <italic>E.coli</italic>, the genes encoding L10 and L12 were cloned in pET11c as the original tandem present in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and thus co-expressed; therefore the complexes were formed <italic>in vivo</italic> in the <italic>E.coli</italic> cells and purified in the intact state.</p><p>Three DNA fragments encoding the complete 23S rRNA-binding sites for L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complexes from <italic>M.jannaschii</italic>, <italic>M.thermolithotrophicus</italic> and <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> were amplified by PCR and cloned into vector pUC18. Each PCR fragment contained the T7 promoter and sites for the restriction enzymes BamHI (upstream) and SmaI (downstream) for cloning; the SmaI site was used also for linearization of the plasmid before transcription. The correct sequences of the cloned PCR products were confirmed by double-stranded sequencing (Microsynth, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec><title>Synthesis of the 23S rRNA fragments</title><p>23S rRNA fragments were transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> using T7 RNA polymerase (Fermentas) from linearized plasmids or DNA fragments amplified by PCR. The DNA fragments amplified by PCR were synthesized using genomic DNA as a template; the upstream primer contains the T7 promoter sequence. To obtain the 23S rRNA fragments shorter than 95 nt containing deletions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and Figure 6) template DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides as a template. The plasmids and DNA fragments used as templates for synthesis of the 23S rRNA fragments by T7 transcription are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p><sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNA fragments were prepared using the MAXIscript&#x02122; T7 <italic>in vitro</italic> Transcription kit (Ambion Inc.) in the presence of [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear Corp.). Transcripts were purified using mini Quick Spin RNA Columns (Roche). To obtain the RNA in preparative scale the following procedure was used. A total of 1&#x02013;3 ml of transcription mixture containing 80 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5), 32 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 mM DTT, 4 mM each of NTPs, 0.2 mM spermidin, 200&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;g/ml of linearized plasmid and 400&#x02013;600 U/ml of T7 RNA polymerase was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02013;4 h. Next, unincorporated nucleotides and template DNA were removed by size exclusion chromatography on a K9/60 column packed with Superdex&#x02122; G-75 (Amersham Bioscience) in a buffer containing 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Fractions containing RNA were pooled and precipitated by ethanol. The purity and integrity of the RNA transcripts were verified by electrophoresis on 8% PAG containing 7 M urea.</p></sec><sec><title>Overproduction and purification of the stalk complexes and of individual L10, L11 and L12 proteins</title><p>R-proteins and stalk complexes used in this study were isolated from <italic>E.coli</italic> BL21(DE3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) transformed with the respective plasmids. To obtain maximal yields of the recombinant proteins and to avoid a potential misincorporation of lysine instead of arginine as a result of the difference in codon usage between <italic>Methanococcus</italic> or <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), the archaeal r-proteins were overproduced in <italic>E.coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells cotransformed with pUBS520, a plasmid that carries the genes for the rare tRNAs<bold><sup>Arg</sup><sub>AGA/AGG</sub></bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Usually, good yields of the recombinant proteins (up to 15&#x02013;20% of total cellular protein) were obtained. The only exceptions were MjaL12 and MigL12 which, when overproduced in the absence of L10, gave rather low yields (&#x0003c;1% of total cellular protein).</p><p>As the purification protocol for MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> from <italic>E.coli</italic> cells described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) used partially denaturing conditions (a buffer with 4 M urea was used), we elaborated a new protocol (see below), which allows purification of the r-proteins and stalk complexes under non-denaturing conditions. Overproduction of recombinant proteins was induced by adding isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) up to 0.1 mM after the density of the host cell culture reached an A<sub>600</sub> of 0.6&#x02013;0.8. 3&#x02013;4 h after induction the <italic>E.coli</italic> cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 6&#x02013;8 ml/g (wet mass) of a buffer containing 100 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mM phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The resuspension buffer for MigL12, MjaL12 and MthL12 contained 100 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM LiCl, 1 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM PMSF; that for EcoL10/L12<sub>4</sub> contained 100 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, 70 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mM PMSF. Cells were passed twice through a chilled French pressure cell at 10&#x02009;000 psi; <italic>E.coli</italic> cell debris and ribosomes were removed by two consecutive centrifugation steps (30&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min and 150&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic> for 2 h). In the case of MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) co-expressed MvaL1 forming inclusion bodies was also removed by these centrifugation steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>Further purification of the r-proteins and stalk complexes (with the exception of EcoL10/L12<sub>4</sub>) was performed with heat treatment of the post-ribosomal fraction. The main contaminating proteins from <italic>E.coli</italic> host cells were denatured by heating for 20 min at 75&#x000b0;C (MjaL10/L12<sub>4</sub>, MjaL11, MigL10/L12<sub>4</sub>, MigL12, MjaL12 and TthL10/L12<sub>6</sub>), 70&#x000b0;C (SsoL10/L12<sub>4</sub>), 65&#x000b0;C (MthL10/L12<sub>4</sub>, MthL12 and GstL10/L12<sub>4</sub>) or 55&#x000b0;C (MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub>) and removed by centrifugation (30&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min). Surprisingly, MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> from the mesophilic <italic>M.vannielii</italic> is thermostable up to 60&#x000b0;C and thus the heat step could be included in the purification procedure. Next, the proteins were precipitated by adding (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> up to 0.6 g/ml and the resulting pellet, harvested by centrifugation (30&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min) was dissolved in a buffer containing 75 mM Na-acetate (pH 5.0), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and loaded on a 5 ml cation-exchange chromatography HiTrap SP-Sepharose (Amersham Bioscience) column equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with loading buffer the proteins were eluted with 40 ml of a linear gradient of 0&#x02013;1 M NaCl and 1 ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing the stalk complex were pooled and dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and loaded on a 5 ml anion-exchange chromatography HiTrap Q-Sepharose (Amersham Bioscience) column equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with loading buffer the proteins were eluted with 40 ml of a linear gradient of 0&#x02013;0.5 M NaCl. Fractions containing pure r-proteins or stalk complexes were pooled and concentrated using Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience) or precipitated with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for storage. In the case of the MjaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> complex, L10, which was produced in excess over L12, was removed at the anion-exchange chromatography step. As for the purification of EcoL10/L12<sub>4</sub>, only the extraction of this complex from native ribosomes was described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). The purification procedure for recombinant EcoL10/L12<sub>4</sub> was in general the same as for the other complexes (see above), with a modified buffer for cation-exchange chromatography [50 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.0), 40 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT].</p><p>After the anion-exchange chromatography purification step, MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> and EcoL10/L12<sub>4</sub> contained traces of RNase activity, which were removed by hydrophobic chromatography.

The purification procedure for L12 proteins included two consecutive anion-exchange chromatography steps on 5 ml HiTrap Q-Sepharose and HiTrap DEAE-Sepharose columns as described above. In both cases, the loading buffer contained 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mM LiCl. 40 ml linear gradients of 0&#x02013;1 M NaCl (for Q-Sepharose) and 0&#x02013;0.5 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (for DEAE-Sepharose) were used to elute the proteins. The purity and homogeneity of the r-proteins and complexes were verified by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, and gel filtration chromatography. Analytical gel filtration chromatography was performed on a Series 1050 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Hewlett-Packard) with a Superdex&#x02122;-75 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Bioscience) in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.6), 7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 30 mM KCl, 70 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and 1 mM DTT.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein analyses</title><p>The stoichiometry of the L10&#x02013;L12 complexes was determined after the purification procedure as well as in an RNA-bound state (&#x02018;active&#x02019; state).

The recombinant complex from <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> showed a ratio of 1:6 (L10:L12), and thus presumably the same heptameric structure (one molecule of L10 and three L12 dimers) was formed as previously described for complexes isolated from <italic>Thermus</italic> ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Only the MjaL10/L12 recombinant proteins were not produced in the ratio 1:4; therefore, there were less than 4 molecules of MjaL12 per molecule of MjaL10 in the host cells. MjaL12 was completely incorporated in pentameric L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complexes. Only free MjaL10, but no other potential intermediates like L10/L12<sub>2</sub>, was detected. This observation is in agreement with a previous analysis of recombinant EcoL10/L12<sub>4</sub> which demonstrated that only L10/L12<sub>4</sub>, but no other potential complexes (e.g. L10/L12<sub>2</sub>), was formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>).</p><p>The homogeneity as well as approximate MWs and linear dimensions of the stalk complexes in solution were tested by analytical gel filtration chromatography (data not shown).

Gel shift experiments revealed that the observed dimeric form of MjaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> binds RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4) whereas MthL10/L12<sub>4</sub> dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;7) and the multimeric forms of MvaL10/L12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lanes 8&#x02013;10) have no affinity for the specific rRNA target site.</p><p>We also determined the stoichiometry of &#x02018;active&#x02019; stalk complexes bound to their specific 23S rRNA-binding site.

All &#x02018;active&#x02019; protein complexes showed a molar ratio very close to 1:4 (L10:L12) and for TthL10/L12<sub>6</sub> a molar ratio of 1:6 (L10:L12) was observed (standard deviations were not more then 10%). Therefore, binding to their specific RNA target site does not influence the stoichiometry of the stalk complexes.</p><p>Purified stalk complexes were tested by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Whereas the L10 proteins demonstrated mobility according to their MW, most of the archaeal L12 proteins had anomalous mobility. MvaL12 had an apparent MW of about 10 000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, lane 7), which is in agreement with the calculated MW of 9819. MthL12, which has almost the same calculated MW and pI as MvaL12 (10 294 and 4.34 in comparison with 9819 and 4.56), formed a clear-cut band on SDS&#x02013;PAGE corresponding to a MW of about 14 000&#x02013;15 000 as isolated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lane 9), as well as part of the MthL10/L12<sub>4</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, lane 6). Protein SsoL12 had an apparent MW of about 17 000 on SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, lane 10) which is much higher than the calculated MW of 11&#x02009;292. MjaL12 and MigL12, with MWs and pIs almost identical to those of MthL12, formed diffuse bands on the gel in the range of approximately 14&#x02009;000 to 24&#x02009;000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, lanes 4 and 5).</p><p>To exclude incomplete denaturation of very stable L12 dimers (or of the tertiary structure of L12 monomers), the denaturing effect of SDS was increased by adding urea (8 M) to the SDS&#x02013;PAG and formamide (90%) to the loading buffer. The increase of the denaturing effect by urea did not notably affect the mobility of most of the archaeal L12 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Only SsoL12 and MvaL12 migrated according to their calculated MWs; MigL12 and MjaL12 formed clear-cut bands (in contrast to diffused bands on standard SDS&#x02013;PAG) with apparent MWs of 20&#x02009;000 and 17&#x02009;000, respectively, which is approximately twice as high as the calculated MWs.</p><p>To prove that the <italic>E.coli</italic> host synthesized correct recombinant L12 proteins, the exact MWs of MigL12 and MthL12 were analyzed by mass-spectrometry as described in Materials and Methods. Mass spectra of MigL12 showed two major peaks at 10 290.0 and 10 319.0 (calculated MW 10 291). Mass spectra of MthL12 also had two major peaks at 10 292.0 and 10 319.0 (calculated MW 10 293). The additional peak can be explained by the presence of bound inorganic ion(s) (e.g. Mg<sup>++</sup>). Thus, the mass spectra documented that both recombinant proteins, MigL12 and MthL12, are of the correct size and contain no post-translational modifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Design of a &#x02018;minimal&#x02019; 23S rRNA fragment carrying the L10 binding site</title><p>The binding site of the stalk complex is located in domain II of 23S rRNA and includes three helices (H42, H43 and H44) and several loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>).

In the presence of MjaL11, 63% of the active MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> bound the specific RNA target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>, lane 6), which represents a 4.5-fold stimulation of MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> binding by MjaL11. An identical stimulation was observed when MjaL11 and MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> were added simultaneously.</p><p>A similar approach was used to examine potential stimulation of the binding of L11 to its rRNA target site in the presence of L10/L12<sub>4</sub>. First, a MjaL10/L12<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;Mja23S-95 complex was formed in excess of the RNA fragment to give a molar ratio of 1:1 (L10/L12<sub>4</sub>-23S rRNA:free 23S rRNA) under standard conditions (37&#x000b0;C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, lane 7) and at 70&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, lane 8), then MjaL11 was added. Surprisingly, the binding of MjaL11 to its specific RNA target site was only influenced by the presence of MigL10/L12<sub>4</sub> at high temperatures. At 37&#x000b0;C, 56% of MjaL11 was bound to free rRNA and only 44% of MjaL11 was complexed with the rRNA&#x02013;MigL10/L12<sub>4</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, lane 5). When the binding experiment was performed at 70&#x000b0;C under the same conditions, MjaL11 preferentially bound the 23S rRNA&#x02013;MigL10/L12<sub>4</sub> complex: 87% of MjaL11 was bound to 23S rRNA complexed with L10/L12<sub>4</sub>, whereas only 13% of MjaL11 was bound to free 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, lane 6). Under the given experimental conditions, the affinity of isolated MjaL11 for the specific RNA target site was not influenced by temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, lanes 2 and 3).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Expression and characterization of the L10&#x02013;L12 complexes</title><p>All recombinant L10&#x02013;L12 complexes used in this study, except that from <italic>M.jannaschii</italic>, were formed in the <italic>E.coli</italic> host cells in a stoichiometry L10:L12 close to 1:4 and 1:6 (<italic>T.thermophilus</italic>), respectively. The same pentameric and heptameric structures were formed as described for complexes isolated from ribosomes of <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>), <italic>S.solfataricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>) and <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Thus, it is a reasonable assumption that all recombinant L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complexes formed in <italic>E.coli</italic> have the same stoichiometry as the complexes forming the L12 stalk in the ribosome. The long-range coupling of the translation of the L10 and L12 cistrons described for <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>) and <italic>M.vannielii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>), which results in the expression of L10 and L12 in a ratio of 1:4, (1:6 for <italic>T.thermophilus</italic>), functions in the <italic>E.coli</italic> host. The translational coupling mechanism ensures the co-ordinate expression of genes, which are encoded on one mRNA. According to this model, the L12 gene is not efficiently expressed from its own Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno sequence unless the preceding L10 gene is also expressed.</p><p>The L12 proteins from (hyper)thermophilic <italic>Methanococcus</italic> species (<italic>M.igneus</italic>, <italic>M.jannaschii</italic>, <italic>M.thermolithotrophicus</italic>), which are closely related (66&#x02013;83% of identity of amino acid sequence) showed an &#x02018;anomalous&#x02019; mobility in SDS&#x02013;PAGE which was not in accordance with their MWs, even after increasing the denaturing effect of SDS by adding 8M to the gel and formamide to the loading buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). These recombinant L12 proteins were of the correct size and had no post-translational modifications, as shown by mass-spectrometry. A possible explanation for the &#x02018;abnormal&#x02019; mobility of MigL12 and MjaL12 (MWs close to 20 000) is that their dimeric structure could not be dissolved. They still form dimers, even under very harsh denaturing condition, Di-, tri- and tetrameric forms in solution were earlier observed for L12 from the thermophilic Bacterium <italic>T.maritima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>).</p><p>As for MthL12, which shows a MW of about 15&#x02009;000, we speculate that the secondary and tertiary structures did not denature completely and prevented equal SDS-binding, decreasing their mobility in SDS&#x02013;PAGE. This assumption is supported by the fact that the mobility of SsoL12 was according to its calculated MW only under very harsh denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> lane10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lane 6). We suggest that described differences in the mobility of the L12 proteins in SDS&#x02013;PAGE (with or without urea) reflect the dissimilarity of some structural features (e.g. stability of the hydrophobic core or secondary structure elements) in the proteins. It is tempting to speculate that the increasing stability of secondary and/or tertiary structure elements, in the order <italic>M.vannielii</italic> &#x02192; <italic>M.thermolithotrophicus</italic> &#x02192; <italic>M.jannaschii</italic> &#x02192; <italic>M.igneus</italic>, is a high temperature adaptation, optimizing the small proteins for thermal demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of archaeal and bacterial stalk complexes with specific 23S rRNA fragments</title><p>Based on the early RNAase and chemical probing data of 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), in combination with the structure of the L11&#x02013;rRNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>) and of the structure of the TthL10<sub>NTD</sub>&#x02013;23S rRNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) it was obvious that helix 42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and B) plays a major role in L10&#x02013;23S rRNA interaction. Phylogenetic sequence alignments of the nucleotide sequences of L10 binding sites on the 23S (28S) rRNAs revealed very high level of homology among Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya. Comparison of the putative secondary structures of these sites demonstrated even more similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). We tried to minimize the L10 binding site of 23S rRNA by deleting helixes 43a, 43 and 44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) of the thiostrepton loop. Only one part&#x02014;helix 43a&#x02014;could be eliminated without completely losing binding capacity; but the saturation level was drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This observed great decrease of saturation with only a small influence on affinity could be a result of rRNA misfolding.</p><p>L10 interacts predominantly with the sugar-phosphate backbone of a number of discontinuous regions of the rRNA and therefore seems to recognize the overall structure of the L10/L11 binding region of 23S rRNA, and in particular, the upper stem of helix 42 and the loops connecting helixes 42&#x02013;43 and 43&#x02013;44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). L10 probably only contacts helix 42 and the upper loop directly. Thus, even if most of the thiostrepton loop was not directly involved in L10 binding (probably this is correct at least for helix 43a), this 23S rRNA region seems to participate in forming the correct conformation of the binding site. Our results indicate that all the other elements of this 23S rRNA area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>) are required for proper folding of the L10 binding site.</p><p>Despite the lack of significant overall sequence identity between bacterial and archaeal L10 NTDs, the secondary structure elements of the TmaL10<bold><sub>NTD</sub></bold> seem to be very similar to the HmaL10<bold><sub>NTD</sub></bold>. Therefore, bacterial and archaeal L10 probably bind to 23S rRNA in a similar manner.</p><p>The determined apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>'s (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) show that all protein complexes effectively interacted with all RNA fragments. The source of RNA fragment has little effect on the affinity. Only minor systematic differences were observed between archaeal and bacterial RNA fragments: in general bacterial stalk complexes showed slightly higher affinity to homologous (bacterial) RNA fragments than to archaeal ones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The drastic differences in affinity between 23S rRNA and stalk complexes from meso-, thermo- and hyperthermophilic microorganisms are determined by the protein partner as was previously demonstrated for r-proteins L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and S8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>'s determined in buffer with an average KCl concentration (350 mM) for hyperthermophilic MigL10/L12<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;RNA and MjaL10/L12<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;RNA complexes were about one order of magnitude higher than that for thermophilic MthL10/L12<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;RNA and more than two orders of magnitude higher than that for mesophilic MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;RNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The bacterial heptameric complex TthL10/L12<sub>6</sub> has an extremely high affinity (the highest ever determined among all ribosomal proteins) both to the archaeal and its own specific 23S rRNA fragments, about one order of magnitude higher than the pentameric complexes from the hyperthermophilic <italic>M.igneus</italic> and <italic>M.jannaschii</italic>, in spite of the fact that the optimal growth temperature of <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> is lower. We cannot exclude that this extraordinary high affinity (i.e. stability of the RNA&#x02013;protein complex) is due to the presence of one additional dimer of L12. Of course, this effect must be indirect, as the the crystal structure of the TthL10IL12 complex and previous studies on the lack of interaction of L12 with RNA exclude a direct interaction of the third dimmer with RNA.</p><p>Thus our binding data confirmed the assumption that stronger protein&#x02013;RNA interactions are typical for (hyper) thermophilic species and probably make a substantial contribution to the thermal stability of r-protein&#x02013;rRNA complexes (and the ribosome as a whole). The lower affinity of r-proteins from thermophilic species and the much lower affinity of r-proteins from mesophilic species might result in a gain of flexibility by the ribosome. Higher flexibility might be a prerequisite for full activity of the ribosome at lower temperatures. Therefore, the stability of the individual rRNA&#x02013;protein complexes within the ribosome modulates the stability of the ribosome and provides an optimum thermostability/flexibility balance at the growth temperature of the organism.</p><p>The salt dependence of L10/L12<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;rRNA-binding for all four archaeal L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complexes was very weak over the range of 50 to 800 mM KCl. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> and B). In general, it appeared that only few, if any, electrostatic interactions play a role in stabilizing the L10/L12<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;23S rRNA complex. This conclusion is in agreement with the model of 23S rRNA&#x02013;HmaL10<bold><sub>NTD</sub></bold> interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), where hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions make a major contribution to RNA&#x02013;protein binding. In the cases of the MthL10/L12<sub>4</sub> and MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), the ionic contacts contribute a bit more to the interaction, possibly because of increased conformational flexibility of those complexes.</p><p>Ionic strength dependence of r-protein&#x02013;RNA interactions is variable, from very weak for r-protein S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>) to intermediate for L11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). Measurement of the salt dependence of protein&#x02013;RNA-binding with subsequent structural study cautions against using the salt dependence of specific protein&#x02013;RNA complexes alone to count ionic interactions and shows that the interactions of many basic residues have been misidentified, as shown in the case of the well studied L11&#x02013;rRNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). Though salt dependence data are difficult to interpret quantitatively, it is useful to appreciate the electrostatic contribution in RNA&#x02013;protein complex formation [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>)].</p><p>The temperature dependence of binding of different pentameric complexes to rRNA is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>. Whereas MthL10/L12<sub>4</sub> (from a thermophilic organism) binding was almost insensitive to temperature, MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> (from a mesophilic organism) required lower temperatures for more effective binding (negative correlation between temperature and <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>), while MigL10/L12<sub>4</sub> and MjaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> (from hyperthermophilic organisms) demonstrated an opposite effect (positive correlation between temperature and <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>). We suppose that this correlation is elucidated by the interference of two different effects. First, the L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complexes might undergo reversible, temperature-dependent conformational changes that can be favorable (especially for extremely thermostable r-proteins with rigid structure) or excessive and unfavorable (for non-thermostable r-proteins with flexible structure). Second, the thermal dissociation might make a negative contribution (especially for low affinity binding r-proteins from mesophiles). The weak temperature dependence of MthL10/L12<sub>4</sub> binding capacity could be a result of mutual compensation of both factors whereas in other cases (MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub>, MigL10/L12<sub>4</sub> or MjaL10/L12<sub>4</sub>) one of the factors probably predominates. This characteristic feature of the MthL10/12<sub>4</sub> complex correlates with the unusual wide range of temperature at which <italic>M.thermolithotrophicus</italic> can grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>), in contrast to other <italic>Methanococcus</italic> species.</p></sec><sec><title>Cooperative effect of binding of r-proteins L10, L11 and L12 to the specific RNA fragment</title><p>Early studies demonstrated that r-protein L10 in the absence of L12 interacts with 23S rRNA very weakly, whereas the isolated r-protein L12 does not interact with rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). L12 does not bind directly to the 23S rRNA, but only via the r-protein L10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>)), for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>). It was also shown that the presence of L12 greatly enhanced the affinity of L10 for 23S rRNA. However there are very few studies about interaction of the isolated r-protein L10 with rRNA, partly because of the instability of this r-protein in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>).</p><p>In our work we demonstrated that stimulation of L10 affinity by L12 takes place also in thermophilic organisms [as it was shown for the mesophilic <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>) and <italic>M.vannielii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>)]. In contrast to L10 from <italic>E.coli</italic>, L10 from the hyperthermophilic Archaeon <italic>M.jannaschii</italic> is quite stable in solution and despite a tendency to aggregate in the isolated state (data not shown), MjaL10 has a rather high affinity for the specific 23S rRNA fragment (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 2.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M). Addition of r-protein MjaL12 drastically increases binding capacity of MjaL10 (50-fold, up to <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 6.1 &#x02212; 7.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> M). The mechanism of this phenomenon is probably related to conformational changes of L10 during its interaction with L12, but our limited knowledge about the 3D structure of L10 in different states (free; L12 bound; 23S rRNA bound) precludes the proposal of a model of this process. The analysis of the bacterial TmaL10/(L12<bold><sub>NTD</sub></bold>)<sub>6</sub> structure demonstrated only rather weak interactions (one salt bridge) between the proximal L12<bold><sub>NTD</sub></bold> molecule and RNA-bound L10<bold><sub>NTD</sub></bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>Binding of L11 and the stalk complex to 23S rRNA has been studied in detail because both of them participate in the formation of the GTPase binding site on the ribosome. Early investigations demonstrated, in particular, that the binding of L10/L12<sub>4</sub> to 23S rRNA in <italic>E.coli</italic> is stimulated by L11 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Later, interactions of the individual L11 protein and the L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complex with 23S rRNA in <italic>E.coli</italic> were studied in more detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) Cooperative effects of binding L11 and L10/L12<sub>4</sub> to 23S rRNA have been corroborated by experiments on interaction of these proteins with mutant 23S rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>). In view of the differences between archaeal and bacterial stalk complexes, (see Introduction) we investigated a cooperative effect of MjaL11 and the complexes MjaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> and MvaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> in binding to the specific 23S rRNA fragment Mja23S-95. We observed stimulation of binding of the L10&#x02013;L12<sub>4</sub> complex by the r-protein L11 and stimulation of binding of the r-protein L11 by the L10/L12<sub>4</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figures 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13</xref>). Interestingly, stimulation of the L11&#x02013;rRNA interaction by MjaL10/L12<sub>4</sub> occurred only at high temperature (70&#x000b0;C) whereas at 37&#x000b0;C no stimulation was observed.</p><p>The most probable reason for such cooperativity in L11&#x02013;L10/L12<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;23S rRNA interaction is the conformational ordering of the rRNA during binding of one of these proteins, which facilitates the interaction of the other partner with the rRNA. On the other hand, the influence of direct interaction between L11 and L10, as proposed in a recent model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), during their binding to 23S rRNA also cannot be excluded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Prof. S.

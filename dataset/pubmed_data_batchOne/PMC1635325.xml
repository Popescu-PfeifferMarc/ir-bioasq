However, their precise role in the modification reaction remains undetermined. Here, we show that GidA is an FAD-binding protein and that mutagenesis of the N-terminal dinucleotide-binding motif of GidA, impairs capability of this protein to bind FAD and modify tRNA, resulting in defective cell growth. Thus, GidA may catalyse an FAD-dependent reaction that is required for production of cmnmU34. We also show that GidA and MnmE have identical cell location and that both proteins physically interact. Gel filtration and native PAGE experiments indicate that GidA, like MnmE, dimerizes and that GidA and MnmE directly assemble in an &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;2 heterotetrameric complex. Interestingly, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis shows that identical levels of the same undermodified form of U34 are present in tRNA hydrolysates from loss-of-function <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> mutants. Moreover, these mutants exhibit similar phenotypic traits. Altogether, these results do not support previous proposals that activity of MnmE precedes that of GidA; rather, our data suggest that MnmE and GidA form a functional complex in which both proteins are interdependent.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>GidA-like proteins are widely distributed in nature. They are conserved among Bacteria and Eukarya and have been classified into two groups, based on the size of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). One group includes proteins of about 600 amino acid residues (GidA<sub>L</sub>), whereas the other comprises proteins of approximately 450 residues (GidA<sub>S</sub>) that are truncated at the C-terminal end compared to the larger ones. Alignment of both the large and small forms of GidA revealed a conserved, dinucleotide-binding motif at the N-terminus. In fact, <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> GidA<sub>S</sub> was shown to bind FAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Thus, it was suggested that GidA proteins either catalyse oxidation&#x02013;reduction reactions or act as sensors for the redox state of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that proteins GidA<sub>S</sub> correspond to a novel class of bacterial site-specific tRNA methyltransferases (tRNA:m<sup>5</sup>U-54 Mtases), and they have been renamed TrmFO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). These enzymes catalyse the site-specific formation of 5-methyluridine in position 54 (m<sup>5</sup>U54) of tRNA using <italic>N</italic><sup>5</sup>, <italic>N</italic><sup>10</sup>-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>folate) as a source of one-carbon unit and a combination of coenzymes NAD(P)H/FAD as reductant. Therefore, they differ from TrmA enzymes, which also catalyse methylation of U54 but using S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor. Curiously, the folate-dependent TrmFO proteins and S-AdoMet-dependent TrmA/Trm2p enzymes appear to have mutually exclusive phylogenetic distributions. Thus, the Bacteria <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> and <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> lack TrmA but posses TrmFO.</p><p>Phylogenetic analyses also support that paralogous TrmFO and GidA<sub>L</sub>(hereafter designated GidA) proteins are two distinct families of proteins that probably evolved from a common ancestor but acquired different, non-overlapping cellular functions during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>).</p><p>GidA was first described in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, where TrmFO is absent (note that methylation of U54 in <italic>E.coli</italic> relies on TrmA). It was shown that disruption of <italic>gidA</italic> in <italic>E.coli</italic> affects cell division, but only when cells are grown on glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). More recent data support that <italic>gidA</italic> is allelic with <italic>trmF</italic> (also called <italic>mnmG</italic>), a gene involved in tRNA modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). According to this, GidA controls together with MnmE the addition of the carboxymethylaminomethyl (cmnm) group in position 5 of the U34 of tRNAs that read codons ending with A or G, in the mixed codon family boxes, i.e. tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>(UUU), tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>(UUC), tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>(UUG), tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>(UAA) and tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(UCU) but the precise role of both proteins in the reaction modification is hitherto unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). In tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>(UUU) and tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>(UUC) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), MnmC transforms the cmnm<sup>5</sup> group into the final 5-methylaminomethyl (mnm<sup>5</sup>) modification, meanwhile MnmA, together with IscS and proteins TusA-E, carries out thiolation in the 2-position of the wobble uridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Modifications in the 2- and 5-positions occur independently of each other; thus, thiolation may precede or follow the synthesis of the side chain at position 5. When selenium is available in the growth medium, sulfur at position 2 may be replaced by selenium in a reaction that is dependent on SelD and YbbB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). It should be noticed that non-thiolated derivatives are present in tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>(UAA) and tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(UCU), (which contain mainly cmnm<sup>5</sup> and mnm<sup>5</sup>, respectively), whereas tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>(UUG) contains mainly cmnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Moreover, it has been recently found that tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>(UCC) contains mainly mnm<sup>5</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), which suggests that this tRNA is also a substrate for MnmE and GidA. Modification at position 5 mediated by GidA and MnmE appears crucial for appropriate decoding of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p><italic>GidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> mutations are pleiotropic, affecting diverse phenotypic traits. This may result from a translational control exerted by GidA and MnmE throughout modification of specific tRNAs. Thus, GidA has been reported to be a global regulator in the plant pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> since, mutations in <italic>gidA</italic> affects antibiotic production, swarming, presence of fluorescent pigment, and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). In the human pathogen <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>, disruption of <italic>gidA</italic> reduces hemolytic and cytotoxic activity associated with enterotoxin Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Since this effect was shown to be due to modulation of the <italic>act</italic> translation by GidA, it was concluded that GidA regulates the most-potent virulence factor of <italic>A.hydrophila</italic>, Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, <italic>E.coli mnmE</italic> has been involved in oxidation of certain heterocyclic substrates, such as thiophene and furan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), and resistance to acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Moreover, loss-of-function <italic>mnmE</italic> mutations are lethal in combination with mutations in some other genes involved in the mRNA decoding process [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) M. Villarroya, L. Yim and M.-E. Armengod, in preparation]. In this respect, <italic>gidA</italic> mutations have also been reported to be incompatible with mutations disabling the normal decoding capability of certain tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). In addition, <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> have been shown to be essential in some human pathogens, such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), supporting the notion that tRNA modification by MnmE and GidA is crucial for survival of these species.</p><p>Interestingly, proteins GidA and MnmE are conserved between Bacteria and Eukarya. <italic>MTO1</italic> and <italic>MSS1/GTPBP3</italic> were found to be the respective homologues of the <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> genes in both yeast and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In yeast, the protein products of <italic>MTO1</italic> and <italic>MSS1</italic> localize in mitochondria, and their mutants are associated with respiratory defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Also in yeast, it has been recently reported that mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> molecules isolated from <italic>MTO1</italic> and <italic>MSS1</italic> deletion strains contain s<sup>2</sup>U instead of the cmnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U found in the wild-type tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> molecules; this indicates that <italic>MTO1</italic> and <italic>MSS1</italic> genes are both involved in the biosynthesis of the 5-carboxy-methylaminomethyl group of cmnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup> of mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Moreover, the human cDNAs of <italic>GTPBP3</italic> and <italic>MTO1</italic> are able to complement yeast <italic>MSS1</italic> and <italic>MTO1</italic> mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Therefore, the function of GidA and MnmE seems to be evolutionarily conserved.</p><p>The general purpose of this work was to gain further insights into the GidA cellular function by studying its location, self-assembly capability, interaction with MnmE and relationships of its putative FAD-binding motif with tRNA modification and cell viability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, phages, plasmids and DNA manipulations</title><p><italic>E.coli</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, unless specified otherwise. Genetic techniques for the construction of strains were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). For DNA manipulations, standard procedures were followed. DH5&#x003b1; strain was used as host for <italic>in vitro</italic> modified plasmids. pIC1153 expresses glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-GidA fusion controlled by the P<sub>tac</sub> promoter and LacI<sup>q</sup> repressor, and was constructed as follows: <italic>gidA</italic> was PCR-amplified from the chromosome of <italic>E.coli</italic> MC1000 strain, using Herculase DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and primers gidA5&#x02032; (5&#x02032;-GGG<underline>GAATTC</underline>TCATGTTTTATCCGGATCCTTTT-3&#x02032;) and gidA3&#x02032; (5&#x02032;-AAA<underline>GAATTC</underline>CGTTATGCGCTACGACGCA-3&#x02032;), incorporating EcoRI restriction sites (underlined). The resulting 1.9 kb fragment was digested with EcoRI and ligated to EcoRI digested pGEX-2T. A recombinant plasmid with proper orientation of <italic>gidA</italic> gene was selected. The same 1.9 kb fragment was ligated to EcoRI digested pJF119EH, rendering pIC1154. This plasmid carries <italic>gidA</italic> under the control of P<sub>tac</sub> and LacI<sup>q</sup>. Again, a plasmid with proper orientation of insert was selected. Plasmid pIC1180 produces a FLAG&#x02013;GidA fusion under control of promoter P<sub>B</sub> and protein AraC. It was constructed as follows: the FLAG epitope coding sequence (DYKDDDDK) was added in frame to 5&#x02032; end of <italic>gidA</italic> by PCR amplification of <italic>gidA</italic> with primers LY30 (5&#x02032;-<italic>GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG</italic>ATGTTTTATCCGGATCCTTTTG-3&#x02032;) and LY31 (5&#x02032;-GC<underline>TCTAGA</underline>TTATGCGCTACGACGCAGC-3&#x02032;), coding sequence for FLAG in cursive and XbaI restriction site underlined. The resulting 1.9 kb fragment was cut with XbaI and inserted into pBAD22 previously digested with NcoI filled with Klenow and then cut with XbaI. Note that the AUG start codon of the fusion protein is included into the NcoI site, CCATGG, on the plasmid. Derivatives of pIC1154 and pIC1180 carrying <italic>gidA</italic> mutations G13A, G15A and G13A/G15A were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange&#x02122;, Stratagene) with appropriate PCR primers. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Strain carrying insertion of Tn<italic>10</italic> in position 51 of <italic>gidA</italic> was a gift from D. Br&#x000e9;geon [see reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), mutant number 10].</p></sec><sec><title>Media, growth conditions, cellular fractionations and enzyme assays</title><p>LBT (Luria&#x02013;Bertani broth containing 40 &#x003bc;g/ml thymine) and LAT (LBT containing 20 g of Difco agar per litre) were used for routine cultures and plating of <italic>E.coli</italic>, unless otherwise specified. When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of ampicillin, 35 &#x003bc;g/ml of chloramphenicol, 12.5 &#x003bc;g/ml of tetracycline and 80 &#x003bc;g/ml of kanamycin. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density (OD) of the cultures at 600 nm. Subcellular fractions of cells were prepared essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, which was used as a cytoplasmic marker, was determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein techniques and production of antisera</title><p>Overproduction of GST-fused GidA was done in DEV16 cells transformed with pIC1153 and pGroESL, grown during 14 h at 25&#x000b0;C with 10 &#x003bc;M isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). GidA purification was carried out using affinity chromatography with glutathione-agarose and further thrombin cleavage, essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Cleavage of the chimera with thrombin rendered two isolated proteins; the 69 kDa expected one and another of lower molecular weight, probably due to internal protease cleavage. The 69 kDa protein was excised from SDS&#x02013;acrylamide gels and used to inoculate New Zealand rabbits. The resulting antiserum was affinity purified with PVDF-bound GidA before use. SDS&#x02013;PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Purification of GST-GidA for pull down assays was done as mentioned above except that no thrombin digestion was performed and elution of the protein was achieved with free glutathione buffer. Purification of GST-MnmE or recombinant MnmE (rMnmE, 53 kDa) for pull down assays was done from DEV16 transformed with pIC684 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Overproduction of FLAG-GidA and mutant derivatives was achieved by growing strain DH5&#x003b1; transformed with pIC1180, pIC1181, pIC1182 or pIC1183, during 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C in LBT containing 0.2% arabinose and ampicillin. In these conditions, FLAG-GidA and derivatives were almost completely soluble so there was no need of chaperone co-expression. Cells were collected, disrupted by sonication, centrifuged and the supernatant (cleared lysate) applied over anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma). The lysate was passed four times through the resin. After collecting the flow through, the resin was washed with 3 &#x000d7; 8 column volumes of TBS [50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl]. FLAG-GidA proteins were eluted with five column volumes of TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml of FLAG peptide (Sigma). Normally, two eluates were collected. Proteins were quantified by Bradford assay using BSA as standard. Overproduction of FLAG-GidA used in pull down assays was performed in DEV16 transformed with pIC1180, to avoid carrying endogenous MnmE protein with purified FLAG-GidA. Production of the anti-MnmE and anti-CyoA antibodies was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Gel filtration chromatography, native PAGE and <italic>in vitro</italic> cross-linking</title><p>Gel filtrations were performed using a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 100 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, containing or not 5 mM DTT, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Gel filtration markers were used to calibrate the column. Proteins were detected by ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 280 nm. Aliquots of selected fractions were analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and, in some cases, native PAGE. Gels and buffers used for native PAGE were made according to the standard Laemmli SDS protocol omitting the SDS. Native gels (10% polyacrylamide) were run at 4&#x000b0;C for 3.5&#x02013;4 h at 15 mA, and stained with Coomassie blue or analysed by immunoelectroblotting using appropriate antibodies. To determine the stoichiometry of the MnmE&#x02022;GidA complex, proteins FLAG-GidA and rMnmE were mixed, at 5 &#x003bc;M each, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM DTT. Samples of the mix and each protein alone were analysed by gel filtration, in the presence of 5 mM DTT, or native PAGE. <italic>In vitro</italic> cross-linking experiments were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>GST-pull down assays</title><p>GST-GidA, GST-MnmE or GST were expressed from plasmids pIC1153, pIC684 and pGEX-2T, respectively, and bound to glutathione-agarose as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Total cleared lysates of cells transformed with plasmids pIC931 (expressing <italic>mnmE</italic>) or pIC1154 (expressing <italic>gidA</italic>), induced during 2 h with 0.5 mM IPTG, were obtained, pre-incubated with glutathione-agarose and added to resin-bound GST-GidA or GST-MnmE, respectively. As a control, equal amounts of both lysates were added to resin-bound GST. Reactions were incubated 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation and after collecting the unbound fraction, and washing extensively the beads with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100, the bound material was eluted with 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8), 10 mM glutathione.

After collecting the unbound fraction, beads were extensively washed with PBS and the remained material eluted with PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide.

Briefly, HPLC separation was achieved with a Lichrospher<sup>R</sup> 100 RP-18 (5 &#x003bc;m) using a linear gradient of water [5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Oac (pH 6.0)] methanol (10%) to water [5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Oac (pH 6.0)] methanol (70%) developed over 35 min at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Flavins were detected by fluorescence emission using a Waters 2475 multi &#x003bb; fluorescence detector.

Subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblotting with anti-TrmFO antibody led to the idea that the <italic>M.xanthus</italic> GidA protein is localized in periplasm, or in association with the inner membrane, since the anti-TrmFO antibody reacted slightly with a protein of 75 kDa, the expected size for GidA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). No null <italic>gidA</italic> mutant was available to be introduced as a negative control in these experiments.

GidA was expressed as a protein fused to the C-terminal region of the GST, but the GST&#x02013;GidA chimera (96 kDa) was only soluble in the presence of overproduced GroES and GroEL chaperons. Cleavage with thrombin of the chimera, after purification by affinity chromatography, allowed the isolation of a recombinant GidA with the expected mass of about 69 kDa that was used to raise antibodies in rabbits. Specificity of the anti-GidA antibody was tested in strains IC4639 and IC5550, which carry the wild-type and <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> allele, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p><italic>E.coli</italic> strains either expressing GidA at wild-type levels (IC4639) or lacking GidA (IC5550) were subjected to subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblotting to identify GidA in the fractions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, GidA was mostly found in the soluble fraction, although at least a portion was also detected in the membrane fraction. Activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, used as a cytoplasmic marker, was negligible in the membrane fraction (lanes M), indicating little, if any, cross-contamination with the soluble fraction (lanes S). These results altogether support that, in <italic>E.coli</italic>, GidA and MnmE display identical localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-association of GidA</title><p>It has been recently reported that the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> TrmFO protein forms homodimers <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Given that TrmFO and GidA proteins share about 25% identity (40% similarity) in their N-terminal homologous region, we asked whether <italic>E.coli</italic> GidA is also able to dimerize. To this end, purified FLAG-GidA protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) was applied to a Superdex-200 HR gel filtration column. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, FLAG-GidA protein eluted as a single peak at &#x0223c;168 kDa, which is consistent with a dimeric form of this protein (expected molecular weight, 141 kDa). An identical result was obtained from gel filtration experiments performed in the presence of DTT, 5 and 10 mM (data not shown), which supports that GidA homodimers may be maintained by non-covalent interactions.</p><p>The ability of GidA to dimerize was also analysed by <italic>in vitro</italic> chemical cross-linking. Extensive cross-linking in solution is taken to be indicative of specific interactions, since random collisions are expected to produce a minimal amount of cross-linking [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) and references therein]. Dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DTSP) was used as the cross-linking molecule; it reacts primarily with &#x0025b;-amines of lysine residues, and is cleavable under reducing conditions. Incubation of FLAG-GidA with DTSP led to the formation of a complex of around 150 kDa, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 3), whereas the subsequent addition of the strong reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) induced dissociation into monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 5).</p></sec><sec><title>GidA and MnmE interact and form an &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;2 heterotetrameric complex</title><p>Several results indicate that both GidA as well as MnmE form homodimers <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>; 7&#x02013;9). Previously, it was observed that when a mitochondrial extract obtained from a yeast transformant overexpressing proteins MTO1 and MSS1 was centrifuged through a sucrose gradient, the two proteins displayed identical sedimentation properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Considering that MTO1 and MSS1 peaked in a region of the gradient between the lactate dehydrogenase and hemoglobin markers, it was concluded that they form a heterodimer complex with a molecular weight of around 121&#x02013;128 kDa. However, because of these experiments did not include appropriate controls showing the sedimentation properties of each protein alone, and in the light of the new results, we thought that other explanations were also possible. For example, it could not be discarded that the gradient fraction supposed to contain the putative heterodimer, actually included MTO1 and MSS1 homodimers. In this respect, it is worthy to mention that the MnmE dimer has an elongated structure, which determines that it migrates in gel filtration at a molecular mass greater than expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Consequently, it would not be surprising that a dimer of its homologue, MSS1, could also display an anomalous sedimentation profile, peaking at a position similar to that of a putative MTO1 dimer. We also reasoned that complexes between MTO1 and MSS1 homodimers, if exist, could not have been detected by sucrose gradient centrifugation because they might be sensitive to pressure and dissociate during high velocity centrifugation. Alternatively, it could not be either discarded the possibility that the MSS1&#x02022;MTO1 complex displayed aberrant sedimentation properties, so that the putative heterodimer were actually a heterotetramer. Thus, we considered that additional experiments were required to prove and clarify interaction between the MnmE and GidA family proteins.</p><p>To explore whether the <italic>E.coli</italic> MnmE and GidA proteins physically interact, we performed GST-pull down analysis using purified GST-MnmE or, alternatively, GST-GidA as a bait. GST-MnmE immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with total protein extracts of a GidA overexpressing strain. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, GidA could be pulled down from the extracts by GST-MnmE but not by GST alone. Moreover, protein EF-Tu, used as a control, was detected only in the unbound supernatant fraction (data not shown). Conversely, when GST-GidA was used as a bait, MnmE was pulled down from a total extract of an MnmE overproducing strain meanwhile, in the same conditions, MnmE was not pulled down by GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggest that MnmE and GidA interact with each other in total <italic>E.coli</italic> extracts; however, they do not inform whether such an interaction is direct or mediated by another protein. In addition, the need to co-overproduce chaperones to obtain soluble GST-GidA protein raises the possibility that some chaperone mediates interaction of MnmE with GST-GidA. Therefore, we decided to perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments using FLAG-GidA protein as bait. This protein is overproduced by adding arabinose to the medium and remains mostly soluble, eliminating the requirement for chaperone co-expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We purified FLAG-GidA by firstly passing it through an anti-FLAG agarose column and later eluting it with excess of FLAG peptide. When analysing the fractions eluted from the column by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), we observed that MnmE, but not EF-Tu, was co-eluted with FLAG-GidA, supporting that MnmE and FLAG-GidA were able to interact in total extracts of <italic>E.coli</italic>. Moreover, we used purified FLAG-GidA as bait to pull down purified recombinant MnmE (rMnmE, molecular mass, 53 kDa). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, rMnmE is pulled down with anti-FLAG agarose only when FLAG-GidA is present, and is eluted from the resin using an excess of FLAG peptide. We therefore conclude that the <italic>E.coli</italic> MnmE and GidA proteins are able to directly interact with each other.</p><p>Next, considering that both MnmE and GidA alone dimerize, we decided to investigate the stoichiometry of the GidA&#x02022;MnmE complex. To this end, purified rMnmE (53 kDa) and FLAG-GidA (70.4 kDa) proteins were applied, either separately or jointly, to a Superdex-200 HR gel filtration column. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that rMnmE and GidA eluted as single peaks at molecular weights of 149 and 168 kDa. Note that the estimated mass of MnmE is larger than expected, but this feature has been previously described and considered to be due to the elongated shape of the MnmE dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). When a mix of GidA and MnmE was chromatographed, both proteins coeluted at a peak of about 195 kDa, which is indicative of their presence in a complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, given that this analysis was performed in the presence of DTT, 5 mM, it may be concluded that the <italic>in vitro</italic> formation of the GidA&#x02022;MnmE complex does not involve disulfide bridges. From these results, and considering that: (i) the apparent mass of the complex is larger than that of each homodimer, (ii) no peaks corresponding to monomeric forms are distinguishable from the elution profile of the mix, and (iii) the peak of the mix (elution fraction <italic>c</italic>) contains approximately equal amounts of GidA and MnmE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we propose that the peak of 195 kDa corresponds to a GidA&#x02022;MnmE heterotetrameric complex of type &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;2, whose compact conformation results in an apparent mass smaller than expected. To confirm this proposal, we analysed migration of a GidA/MnmE mix in native gels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, purified rMnmE and FLAG-GidA proteins migrate, when separately loaded, at positions corresponding to a molecular mass of 102 and 171 kDa, respectively. Note that in this case, the apparent mass of MnmE fits well with that expected for its dimeric form. The mix of MnmE and GidA produces bands of 102, 171 and 250 kDa. Since the last one is recognized by both anti-MnmE and anti-GidA antibody (data not shown), and its size fits well with the sum of sizes of the MnmE and GidA homodimers, as estimated from their migration in the same native gel, we conclude that it corresponds to the &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;2 heterotetrameric form of the GidA&#x02022;MnmE complex. It is worthy to mention that, when samples of the elution fractions <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic> from the gel filtration experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) were analysed by native PAGE, a predominant 250 kDa band was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, lanes 2 and 3), which supports the idea that the apparent mass of the heterotetrameric GidA&#x02022;MnmE complex estimated from gel filtration is smaller than that estimated from native PAGE.</p></sec><sec><title>The FAD domain of GidA is required for the tRNA modifying function of this protein</title><p>Alignment of Gid proteins in the database reveals a highly conserved dinucleotide-binding motif [xhxhxGxGxxG(x)<sub>3</sub>hxxh(x)<sub>9</sub>hxhxxE/D, where x is any residue and h is a hydrophobic residue] near the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). In fact, the TrmFO proteins from <italic>M.xanthus</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) and GidA proteins from <italic>B.subtilis</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) were reported to bind FAD. In this study, we have found that FLAG-GidA absorbs at about 340 and 430 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), in agreement with the idea that GidA binds flavin. Moreover, HPLC analysis indicated that the cofactor released from FLAG-GidA by heating the protein at 75&#x000b0;C for 15 min was FAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, inset). In contrast, the visible spectrum of MnmE, the GidA partner in the modification reaction, reveals that this protein does not contain flavin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>The dinucleotide-binding motif present in the N-terminal end of GidA is known to be part of the Rossmann fold characteristic of the glutathion reductase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The importance of the invariant glycine residues (GxGxxG) in this motif is well understood, with the two first glycines determining close contact of the main chain to the pyrophosphate of FAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In agreement with this, when we separately changed these invariant glycines to alanine on FLAG-GidA, the UV-visible spectrum of the purified proteins G13A (from plasmid pIC1181) and G15A (from plasmid pIC1182) indicated that the absorbing peaks at around 340 and 430 nm were significantly lower than those produced by the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>), suggesting that both mutant proteins bind FAD in less extent than the wild-type GidA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the FAD-binding motif of GidA is involved in the tRNA modifying function of this protein, we introduced mutations G13A and G15A on plasmid pIC1154 (carrying the <italic>gidA</italic> wild-type gene under control of promoter P<sub>tac</sub>) and proceeded to analyse the nucleoside composition of tRNA from strains producing wild-type or mutant GidA proteins. First, total tRNA from strains MG1655 (wild-type) and IC5241 (MG1655 <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic>) was hydrolysed and analysed by HPLC. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, a peak corresponding to nucleoside mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U is detected in tRNA from strain MG1655, but not in tRNA isolated from IC5241. Conversely, a peak corresponding to s<sup>2</sup>U is seen in tRNA from IC5241, but not in tRNA from the wild-type strain. This indicates that in the <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> strain, the addition of cmnm group in position 5 of U34 is defective, rendering U34 modified only in position 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Note that this pattern is similar to that observed in tRNAs obtained from the <italic>mnmE::kan</italic> strain (10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lower panel). These results show for the first time that interruption of the <italic>gidA</italic> gene impairs formation of mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U34, and definitively prove that <italic>gidA</italic> is allelic to <italic>trmF</italic> (see Introduction). In this respect, it should be pointed out that the original proposal by Br&#x000e9;geon <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) that <italic>trmF</italic> and <italic>gidA</italic> are allelic was mostly based on genetic mapping data, (which were not precise in the <italic>trmF</italic> case) as well as on phenotypic traits. Next, we analysed the nucleoside composition of strains producing mutant GidA proteins. Thus, total tRNA from strain IC5241 (MG1655 <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic>) transformed with pIC1154 (P<italic><sub>tac</sub></italic>-<italic>gidA</italic>) or each one of its mutant derivatives (pIC1177, pIC1178 and pIC1179 carrying alleles G13A, G15A or G13A/G15A, respectively), and grown with or without IPTG, was hydrolysed and analysed by HPLC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (without IPTG, left panels), a peak corresponding to s<sup>2</sup>U is detected in the analysis of tRNA from strains G13A, G15A and G13A/G15A, although it is most prominent in the last one. This pattern is indicative of a defect in the addition of the cmnm group to position 5 of U34 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), as shown in the analysis of strain <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Note, however, that a small peak corresponding to mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U34 is present in tRNA isolated from mutants G13A, and G15A but not in tRNA isolated from G13A/G15A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, left panels). This suggests that even in the absence of the IPTG inducer, a certain amount of protein G13A or G15A is produced, which is able to modify a fraction of tRNA molecules. When tRNA is isolated from IPTG-induced G13A and G15A strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, right panels), the peak corresponding to s<sup>2</sup>U decreases whereas that corresponding to mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U increases. This behaviour is not observed with tRNA isolated from mutant G13A/G15A, which suggests that the GidA protein produced by this mutant is a full loss-of-function protein. Western blot analysis confirmed production of the mutant proteins even in the absence of the IPTG inducer, which is probably due to an incomplete repression of the strong promoter P<italic><sub>tac</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, &#x02212;IPTG). No significant differences among cellular levels of the plasmid encoded wild-type and mutant proteins were observed both in the presence as well as in the absence of IPTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), indicating that the defects in tRNA modification observed in cells expressing mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) are not due to a lower accumulation of these proteins into the cell. It is also interesting to note that the cellular levels of proteins G13A and G15A synthesized in the absence of IPTG were similar to the native levels of GidA in strain MG1655 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, &#x02212;IPTG). This supports that proteins G13A and G15A are not as effective as the native GidA protein in conducting tRNA modification since s<sup>2</sup>U is present in tRNA purified from strains expressing proteins G13A and G15A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, left panels), but not in tRNA obtained from the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, a small but discernible peak of s<sup>2</sup>U is still detected from tRNA of strains overexpressing proteins G13A and G15A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, right panel), in spite of their respective cellular levels are much higher than the native levels of GidA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, +IPTG). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that G13A and G15A are partial loss-of-function proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotype of GidA mutants</title><p>Full loss-of-function <italic>mnmE</italic> mutations are lethal in the genetic backgrounds of strains JC7623 and V5701 but not in those of MC1000, DEV16 and MG1655 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). At present, we have demonstrated that the lethal phenotype results from incompatibility of loss-of-function <italic>mnmE</italic> mutations with mutations in genes involved in the ribosomal dynamic (M. Villarroya, L. Yim and M.-E. Armengod, manuscript in preparation). Here, we have found that the <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> allele cannot be recovered on the V5701 chromosome after P1 transductions unless the receptor strain carries a second copy of <italic>gidA</italic> on a plasmid that allows accumulation of the wild-type, G13A or G15A GidA protein (i.e. plasmids pIC1154, pIC1177 and pIC1178; data not shown). This indicates that the <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> null allele is also lethal in the V5701 background and that the single mutations G13A and G15A should be partial loss-of-function mutations, given that overexpression of the corresponding proteins allows recovery of allele <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> on the V5701 chromosome. It should be pointed out that overexpression of protein G13A/G15A (from plasmid pIC1179) does not lead to recovery of allele <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic>, which means that it is not able to complement for the null allele and, therefore, that mutation G13A/G15A is a full loss-of-function mutation.</p><p>Note that, similarly to full loss-of-function <italic>mnmE</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), the G13A/G15A or <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> mutations could be recovered on the DEV16 or MG1655 chromosome even in the absence of a second copy of the wild-type <italic>gidA</italic> gene (see e.g. strains IC5241 and IC5550 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the cell growth is slowed down by about 30% when mutation <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> is introduced into strain MG1655, and this effect can be suppressed by a plasmid overexpressing protein G13A or G15A but not by a plasmid overexpressing protein G13A/G15A (data not shown). This indicates that mutation G13/G15 affects cell growth in the same extent than a null <italic>gidA</italic> mutation does, which is in agreement with the idea that G13/G15 is a full loss-of-function mutation.</p><p>We have also found that mutations <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> and <italic>mnmE::kan</italic> reduce the doubling time of strain MG1655 to a similar extent in LB (doubling times: 29.9 &#x000b1; 2.3, 37.8 &#x000b1; 2.7 and 38.2 &#x000b1; 3.1, for wild-type, <italic>mnmE</italic> and <italic>gidA</italic> strains, respectively), minimal medium supplemented with casaminoacid (doubling times: 50.3 &#x000b1; 3.6, 63.7 &#x000b1; 4.1 and 64.1 &#x000b1; 4.2, for wild-type, <italic>mnmE</italic> and <italic>gidA</italic> strains, respectively), and minimal medium, in which both mutations seem to have a minor effect (doubling times: 90 &#x000b1; 5.5, 103.1 &#x000b1; 5.9 and 100.2 &#x000b1; 4.5, for wild-type, <italic>mnmE</italic> and <italic>gidA</italic> strains, respectively). Curiously, Br&#x000e9;geon <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) found that whilst the growth rate of their <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> and <italic>mnmE::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> mutants was reduced in LB to the same level, only mutation <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> significantly reduced the growth rate in minimal medium. This difference of phenotype conferred by <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> mutations led Br&#x000e9;geon <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) to propose that the MnmE activity precedes that of GidA in the tRNA modification pathway, and that accumulation of the unknown product of MnmE in <italic>gidA</italic> mutants could be toxic for cells under slow growth conditions. If MnmE worked before GidA, we should find a reduction of the s<sup>2</sup>U levels in <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> mutants since the hypothetical MnmE product would be generated in these mutants at expenses of s<sup>2</sup>U (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, we have found that the levels of s<sup>2</sup>U are near identical in full loss-of-function <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, our results do not support the idea that the MnmE activity precedes that of GidA. Moreover, as above pointed out, we have not found significant differences between the growth rate of <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> mutants in minimal medium. The discrepancy between these results and those reported by Br&#x000e9;geon <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) might be due to the use of different insertion mutations. Our strains carry the Tn<italic>10</italic> insertion at position 51 in <italic>gidA</italic>, whereas Br&#x000e9;geon <italic>et al</italic>. used a <italic>gidA</italic> mutant carrying the Tn<italic>10</italic> insertion at position 707 for their experiments. In both insertions, the orientation of the minitransposon remains to be determined. Minitransposons may be polar and their effect on neighbouring genes may depend on their location and orientation within the target gene. Therefore, it is possible that the effect of each Tn<italic>10</italic> insertion on <italic>gidA</italic> neighbouring genes (i.e. <italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>gidB</italic>, which encodes a putative methyltransferase of unknown function) were different, and this may be the true cause of the different behaviour of <italic>gidA</italic> insertion mutants in minimal medium. Since plasmid pIC1154, which just carries the structural <italic>gidA</italic> gene under control of a suitable promoter, reverted the growth rate of our <italic>gidA::</italic>Tn<italic>10</italic> mutant to the wild-type level, we are confident that, in this strain, the polar effects of the minitransposon, if there exist, are negligible. Consequently, our data support the conclusion that loss-of-function <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> mutations have similar effects on cell growth (including the synthetic lethality phenomenon and growth rate, see above) and the tRNA modification status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The role of tRNA in mRNA decoding is crucial to the accuracy and efficiency of protein synthesis. The post-transcriptional modifications that occur at the wobble position of tRNAs that read codons in the mixed codon boxes are particularly significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). <italic>E.coli</italic> mutants defective in the biosynthesis of mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U, the modified nucleoside that is present in the wobble position of tRNAs specific for Lys and Glu, were firstly isolated based on the readthrough phenotype at UAG codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). This allowed the characterization of the <italic>trmE</italic> and <italic>trmF</italic> loci, which were mapped to two different locations on the <italic>E.coli</italic> chromosome, although the phenotype of both type of mutants was quite similar. The isolation and study of <italic>trmC</italic> (<italic>mnmC</italic>) mutants allowed to conclude that <italic>trmF</italic> and <italic>trmE</italic> control the addition of the cmnm group in position 5 of the wobble uridine (6; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Later, the <italic>trmE</italic> gene was shown to be allelic with a gene encoding a 50 kDa GTPase, and renamed <italic>mnmE</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), whereas <italic>trmF</italic> was proposed to be allelic with <italic>gidA</italic> from indirect genetic evidence and phenotypic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). However, no analysis of the tRNA modification status in <italic>gidA</italic> mutants has been performed up to now. In this study, we show for the first time that mutations in the <italic>E.coli gidA</italic> gene impair the biosynthesis of mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and, therefore, definitively prove that <italic>gidA</italic> is allelic to <italic>trmF</italic>. The tRNA modifying function assigned to <italic>gidA</italic> is in agreement with recent findings in yeast showing that disruption of the <italic>gidA</italic> homologous gene, <italic>MTO1</italic>, impairs the biosynthesis of cmnm<sup>5</sup>U, the nucleoside normally present in the wobble position of mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), which strongly supports the idea that the function of GidA is evolutionarily conserved. Similarly, disruption of <italic>MSS1</italic>, the homologous gene of <italic>mnmE</italic> in yeast, also impairs biosynthesis of cmnm<sup>5</sup>U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), which argue in favour of a conservative evolution of the cmnm<sup>5</sup>U biosynthesis pathway. However, the precise role of MnmE and GidA family proteins in this pathway remains undetermined. One way to gain insights into such a role is by elucidating the activities of both proteins that are required for their tRNA modifying function. Thus, we have previously found that <italic>E.coli</italic> MnmE exhibits a GTPase activity that is essential for that function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Moreover, biochemical and structural data indicated that <italic>T.maritima</italic> MnmE binds 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). This strongly supports a direct participation of MnmE in the tRNA modification reaction since formyl-tetrahydrofolate might be used as the one-carbon unit donor in the formation of the cmnm group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Such a proposal is in line with previous data indicating that the first carbon atom in the side chain at 5 position of cmnm<sup>5</sup>U originates from a source other than methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Furthermore, alignment of GidA proteins and their paralogues TrmFO revealed a highly conserved dinucleotide-binding motif near the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). In fact, the TrmFO proteins from <italic>M.xanthus</italic> and <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), and GidA proteins from <italic>B.subtilis</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) were reported to bind FAD, although in the case of GidA proteins, data were never shown. In this respect, we have found here that GidA contains noncovalently bound FAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and that change to alanine of G13 and G15, two residues belonging to the FAD-binding motif of GidA, impairs capability of this protein to modify tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This indicates that GidA, whichever the mechanism of U34 modification is, catalyses an FAD-depending reaction that is also required for generation of cmnm<sup>5</sup>U.</p><p>Immunoelectron microscopy and subcellular fractionation indicated that MnmE is localized in both the cytoplasm and, to a lesser but significant extent, the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In this work, experiments of subcellular fractionation show that GidA is mostly found in the soluble fraction, although at least a portion was also detected in the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We find this to be indicative that both proteins have identical subcellular distribution. A predominant cytoplasmic localization, or even a partial association with the cytoplasmic membrane inner face, is foreseeable for enzymes whose substrate is tRNA. Moreover, we show for the first time that purified MnmE and GidA proteins interacts <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that both proteins form a functional complex that carries out the modification reaction. Considering that dimerization of MnmE is required to form its tetrahydrofolate binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and that GidA mostly forms dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), it seems reasonable to propose that a heterotetramer of type &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;2 is the functional form of the MnmE&#x02022;GidA complex. In fact, our results from gel filtration experiments and analysis in native gels strongly support this proposal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is of interest to mention that whilst the apparent mass of the MnmE dimer estimated from gel filtration is larger than expected (149 versus 100 kDa), because of its elongated shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), the apparent mass of the &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;2 MnmE&#x02022;GidA complex is smaller than expected (&#x0223c;195 kDa, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since the mobility of particles on gel filtration depends on their size and their shape, our results suggest that formation of the heterotetrameric complex increases the compactness of the interacting partners. The MnmE&#x02022;GidA complex runs in native gels with an apparent mass of about 250 kDa, which fits well with the expected mass for a heterotetramer of type &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>MnmE and GidA are evolutionarily conserved proteins present in mitochondria of yeast and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Interestingly, taurine is directly incorporated into human mitochondrial tRNAs in a modification process that probably involves the human MnmE and GidA homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Thus, it was proposed a model where both proteins catalyse the formation of an unknown intermediate, and the subsequent activity of a taurine or glycine transferase is responsible for construction of the 5-taurinomethyl group in humans, or 5-cmnm group in yeast and bacteria [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>]. On the other hand, differences in growth rate between <italic>E.coli mnmE</italic> and <italic>gidA</italic> null mutants led to the idea that the MnmE activity precedes that of GidA in the tRNA modification pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Thus, considering the ability of MnmE and GidA to bind 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate and FAD, respectively, it was proposed a new model where MnmE catalyses the transfer of the formyl group from formyl-tetrahydrofolate onto the 5 position of the uridine base, producing a formylated uridine and, subsequently, GidA mediates transfer of glycine and catalyses a reduction reaction required for generation of the cmnm<sup>5</sup> modification [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>]. According to this model, in the HPLC analysis from tRNA hydrolysates, we would expect to observe disappearance of s<sup>2</sup>U if a thiolated intermediate (s<sup>2</sup>f<sup>5</sup>U) were synthesized by MnmE in <italic>gidA</italic> mutants. In contrast, s<sup>2</sup>U is present in hydrolysates of tRNA isolated from mutants <italic>gidA</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic> and G13A/G15A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In fact, the relative levels of s<sup>2</sup>U found in these mutants were near identical to those found in the <italic>mnmE::kan</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We have observed that MnmE is pulled down by the FLAG-GidA G13A/G15A mutant protein (data not shown), which indicates that the FAD-binding ability of GidA is not required for the physical interaction with MnmE. However, MnmE does not seem to work successfully in the presence of protein G13A/G15A since s<sup>2</sup>U, as pointed out above, is found in tRNA of mutant G13A/G15A at similar levels than in tRNA from the <italic>mnmE::kan</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). These results do not support previous proposals that activity of MnmE precedes that of GidA in the MnmE/GidA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>); rather, our data fit better with a model where proteins GidA and MnmE form a functional complex in which both proteins are interdependent. Moreover, we have not observed differences between the growth rate of <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> mutants in minimal medium, so that we think that differences reported by other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) might be due to polar effects of the <italic>gidA</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic> mutation used in their experiments. The similar phenotype produced by loss-of-function <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> mutations on cell survival and cell growth that we describe here (see subsection &#x02018;Phenotype of GidA mutants&#x02019;) also supports a model in which MnmE and GidA are interdependent proteins. Development of an <italic>in vitro assay</italic> using a recombinant MnmE&#x02022;GidA complex will provide a key to clarify the molecular mechanism of the MnmE/GidA dependent pathway.</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis indicate that GidA and TrmFO protein families have evolved from a common ancestor but acquired different, non-overlapping cellular functions during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Our results clearly show that GidA and MnmE form a heterocomplex, and suggest that both proteins drive the tRNA modification process by forming such a complex. In other words, whilst the TrmFO enzymes catalyze folate-dependent formation of 5-methyluridine at position 54 of tRNA by themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), GidA requires association with MnmE to catalyze formation of cmnm<sup>5</sup>U at position 34. Thus, the MnmE&#x02022;GidA complex seems to represent a new evolutionary way to use a folate derivative and FAD in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA.</p><p>Interestingly, s<sup>2</sup>mnm<sup>5</sup>U was reported to be present in tRNA from Archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). However, we have not found homologous of <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> in the sequenced genomes of archaeal organisms. Search for <italic>mnmE</italic> homologues led to find proteins from Archaea that only exhibit a minor homology with MnmE in the G domain, which could just indicate that they are GTP-binding proteins. Thus, it seems that if ancient <italic>gidA</italic> and <italic>mnmE</italic> homologues there existed, divergent evolution between Bacteria and Archaea has produced proteins with a very low level of homology, even undetectable in the case of GidA. Alternatively, it might be possible that formation of mnm<sup>5</sup> in Archaea depends on proteins that are not evolutionarily related to MnmE and GidA. If so, this would mean that a pathway for synthesis of mnm<sup>5</sup> has been established independently at least twice during evolution.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr E.

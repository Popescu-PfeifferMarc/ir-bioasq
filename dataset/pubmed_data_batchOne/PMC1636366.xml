To elucidate the function of NOP132 in the nucleolus, we identified proteins that interact with NOP132 using mass spectrometric methods. NOP132 associated mainly with proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and RNA metabolism, including the DEAD-box RNA helicase protein, DDX47, whose yeast homolog is Rrp3, which has roles in pre-rRNA processing. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged DDX47 co-precipitated rRNA precursors, as well as a number of proteins that are probably involved in ribosome biogenesis, implying that DDX47 plays a role in pre-rRNA processing. Introduction of NOP132 small interfering RNAs induced a ring-like localization of DDX47 in the nucleolus, suggesting that NOP132 is required for the appropriate localization of DDX47 within the nucleolus. We propose that NOP132 functions in the recruitment of pre-rRNA processing proteins, including DDX47, to the region where rRNA is transcribed within the nucleolus.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ribosome biogenesis is a highly complex and coordinated process that occurs not only in the nucleolus but also in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>) that has been studied extensively in yeast systems using both biochemical and genetic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Based on the protein composition of several yeast ribosomal subunit precursors recently characterized by proteomic approaches, more than 170 factors are predicted to participate in ribosome biogenesis [see review in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)]. Thus, proteomic approaches have provided additional evidence for a ribosome assembly pathway in eukaryotes and have confirmed the dynamics of the entire process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>Ran is a member of the Ras superfamily of small G proteins and a nuclear protein with several functions, including nucleocytoplasmic transport of many types of proteins and of nucleic acids across nuclear membranes and ribosome biogenesis through Dis3, an exosome subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The gene encoding the yeast homolog of RCC1 (<italic>SRM1</italic>), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ran, genetically interacts with <italic>GTR1</italic> in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Gtr1 and Gtr2 are associated with each other and belong to a novel subfamily of small G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and play various roles in cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Gtr1 is associated with Rpc19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and Nop8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) which is an essential nucleolar protein required for 60S ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and is associated with nucleolar protein Nip7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), suggesting that Gtr1 could play roles in multiple steps of ribosome biogenesis. Human RRAG A/Rag A/FIP-1 is a functional homolog of yeast Gtr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and is associated with an essential nucleolar protein, NOP132, which interacts with RRAG C, RRAG D, and human NIP7 and might anchor these proteins to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that NOP132 is similar to yeast Nop8. Thus, NOP132 might have a role in ribosome biogenesis. NOP132 was found to be upregulated in diffuse-type gastric cancer in an attempt to identify novel therapeutic targets for this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>RNA helicases from the DEAD-box family are present in almost all organisms and have important roles in RNA metabolism. They participate in many processes, such as the synthesis, processing, export, and degradation of RNA [see review in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>)]. In humans, 36 members of the DEAD-box family of putative RNA helicases have been identified and are hypothesized to have roles in differentiation and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has 26 DEAD-box proteins, many of which are involved in ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>Here we used a proteomic approach to elucidate the function of NOP132 in human cells. We identified NOP132-associated proteins by mass spectrometric analysis; among the identified proteins were the nucleolar DEAD-box RNA helicases DDX47 and DDX18. We also showed that DDX47-associated proteins are very similar to those associated with NOP132. Because FLAG-tagged DDX47 could be co-precipitated with rRNA precursors, DDX47 may be involved in pre-rRNA processing. To understand the significance of the association of NOP132 with DDX47, we examined the subcellular localization of DDX47 upon downregulation of NOP132 by RNA interference (RNAi). NOP132 downregulation caused mislocalization of DDX47. Herein we propose that NOP132 recruits DDX47 protein to the center of the nucleolus, where it functions in the processing of primary rRNA transcripts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transient transfection</title><p>BHK21, 293, 293EBNA, and HeLa cells were grown at 37.5&#x000b0;C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 &#x000b5;g/ml) in an incubator under 10% CO<sub>2</sub> or, for 293EBNA cells, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

One sample (Figure 1, lane 3) was sonicated on ice for 1 s (Sonicator&#x02122;; Heat System-Ultrasonics Inc., Farmingdale, NY), with a microtip, 40% cycle, and output control of 4. The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 15&#x02009;000 rpm for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C and incubated with 20 &#x000b5;l anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 4 h at 4&#x000b0;C to immunoprecipitate NOP132-associated complexes. After the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and once with 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.0/150 mM NaCl, complexes bound to the agarose beads were eluted with 20 &#x000b5;l 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.0/150 mM NaCl containing 500 &#x000b5;g/ml FLAG peptide. The eluted complexes were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Protein-containing SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel fragments were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). The resulting peptides were recovered and analyzed for peptide mass fingerprinting using a PE Biosystems Voyager DE-STR (Perkin-Elmer, Inc., Wellesley, MA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Peptide masses were searched with 50 p.p.m. mass accuracy using the database fitting program MS-Fit (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="prospector.ucsf.edu"/>), and protein identification was performed according to the criteria described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).

The peptide mixture was applied to a Mightysil-RP-18 (3 &#x000b5;m particle; Kanto Chemical, Osaka, Japan) fritless column (45 mm &#x000d7; 0.150 mm, i.d.) and separated using a 0&#x02013;40% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% formic acid over 80 min at a flow rate of 50 or 25 nl/min. Eluted peptides were sprayed directly into a quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Q-ToF 2; Micromass, Wythenshawe, UK). MS/MS spectra were acquired by data-dependent collision-induced dissociation, and MS/MS data were analyzed using MASCOT software (Matrix Science, London, UK) for peptide assignment. The criteria were in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If necessary, match acceptance of automated batch processes was confirmed by manual inspection of each set of raw MS/MS spectra in which the major product ions were matched with theoretically predicted product ions from the database-matched peptides. A mock eluate, which used anti-FLAG with the FLAG peptide, was analyzed by the same LC-MS/MS method as used for the NOP132-associated complexes and the identified proteins were then subtracted from the proteins identified in the FLAG-NOP132 co-precipitations. Thus, those proteins identified in the mock eluate were not included in the list of NOP132-associated proteins unless a quantitative increase was confirmed.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of GST-fusion proteins</title><p>An <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 strain carrying a GST plasmid was grown in 750 ml of Luria&#x02013;Bertani medium and was treated with isopropyl &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactoside (final conc., 0.2 mM) for 4 h at 30&#x000b0;C as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).

Twenty microgram of either GST, GST-DDX47, GST-DDX18, or GST-GRWD1 bound to the glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads was mixed with baculovirus-produced NOP132.

Protein identification was first performed for individual bands excised from SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels using in-gel digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy. This approach identified RNA helicase DEAD/H (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp/His) box polypeptide 47 (DDX47), ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3), glutamate-rich WD repeat protein (GRWD1), and KIAA0539 [NOP254, a possible human ortholog to yeast Npa1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>)] as candidates for NOP132-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, lane 2).

A similar identification experiment was performed to isolate more complex-associated proteins using 293 cells as recipient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, lane 3). We found that most of the NOP132 was resistant to solubilization with our immunoprecipitation buffer, but could be more completely solubilized upon brief sonication. Thus, we briefly sonicated NOP132-transfected 293 cells and solubilized FLAG-tagged NOP132 efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, lane 3). These experiments also identified nucleolin/NCL (yeast ortholog Nsr1), B23/NPM1, fibrillarin/FBL (Nop1), Nop5/Nop58, BRIX/BXDC2 (Brx1), putative nucleotide-binding protein estradiol-induced nuclear GTPase/GNL3 (Nug1), RNA helicase Gu/DDX21, DHX9, DDX18 (Has1), many ribosomal proteins from the large and small subunits, and other non-ribosomal proteins, most of which were found in previously characterized human pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein (rRNP) complexes, as candidates for NOP132-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>; Supplementary Table 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). In addition, the FLAG immunoprecipitates in FLAG-NOP132-expresssing cells contained many splicing factors, suggesting that NOP132 might also be involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This is consistent with our previous observation that NOP132 co-localizes with proteins such as Clk-1 and RNPS1 located in nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). P53, a tumor suppressor, was repeatedly identified in NOP132 complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1) and was also detected in NOP132 complex by western blotting (data not shown). RRAG A was not detected in the NOP132 complex, however. This finding might be the result of a transient interaction or because RRAG A is a minor component of the NOP132 complex and consequently below the limit of detection of this experiment.</p><p>Among the proteins identified, DDX47, which was repeatedly identified, and DDX18, which was identified once but belongs to a group of proteins similar to DDX47, were used for reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments. The associated proteins were identified from SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b, c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2b</xref>) and are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. One hundred and eight proteins associated with DDX18 and 119 proteins associated with DDX47 were identified by nano-LC-MS/MS analysis after Lys-C digestion (Supplementary Table 1). Analysis of these proteins indicated that the two complexes share 37 large subunit ribosomal proteins, 23 small subunit ribosomal proteins, and 41 non-ribosomal proteins in common, demonstrating their similarity in protein composition. DDX47 was found in the DDX18 complex but, we did not detect DDX18 in the DDX47 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that a major portion of the DDX47 complexes is present in human cells without DDX18 or expression level of DDX18 is low. The analyses further indicated that 32 non-ribosomal proteins, including probable trans-acting factors involved in ribosome biogenesis, such as nucleolin/NCL (Nsr1), B23/NPM1, putative nucleotide binding protein estradiol-induced nuclear GTPase/GNL3 (Nug1), RNA helicase Gu/DDX21, and DHX9, found in the NOP132-associated complex were also found in DDX18- and DDX47-associated complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). In addition most of the ribosomal proteins found in the NOP132-associated complexes were also present in the in DDX18- and DDX47-associated complexes. The overlap of proteins present in all three complexes suggests functional similarity among these complexes in human ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>Among the non-ribosomal proteins we identified, karyopherins &#x003b1;3, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b2;1 were present only in NOP132-associated complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). Of these, karyopherin &#x003b1;3 interacted with NOP132 even after RNase treatment (data not shown and Supplementary Table 1). Because karyopherin &#x003b1;3 binds to the NLS and is a transporter for nuclear proteins containing a NLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), it might have a role in the transport of NOP132 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Similarly, karyopherin &#x003b1;2 was present in the DDX47-associated complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that it might be a nuclear transport factor for DDX47.</p></sec><sec><title>Association of NOP132 with DDX47 and DDX18</title><p>Despite the fact that DDX18 and DDX47 were detected in FLAG-NOP132-associated complexes by nano-LC-MS/MS analysis, NOP132 was not found in either FLAG-DDX18- or FLAG-DDX47-associated complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To confirm the association of NOP132 with DDX18 and DDX47, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell extracts prepared from 293 cells transfected with NOP132 and either FLAG-tagged DDX18 or FLAG-tagged DDX47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). These experiments confirmed that NOP132 can associate with both DDX18 and DDX47. The association of NOP132 with DDX47 and DDX18 was decreased significantly by RNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, lanes 7 and 9), suggesting that their interaction is dependent on RNA. Similarly, most of the NOP132-, DDX47-, and DDX18-associated proteins were released by RNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, lanes 2, 4 and 6), suggesting that RNAs are crucial for complex formation. However, several proteins remained associated with FLAG-NOP132 or FLAG-DDX47 after RNase treatment, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> (lanes 2 and 4).Other protein bands in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> (lanes 2, 4 and 6) were identified to be NOP132, DDX47, DDX18 or background proteins (identified from a control experiment of 293 cells transfected with a FLAG vector) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, lanes 8 and 9). We also examined the association using purified GST-DDX47, GST-DDX18 and GST-GRWD1 with NOP132 synthesized in baculovirus in an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay and demonstrated that NOP132 bound both DDX47 and DDX18 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). A very small but significant amount of NOP132 was detected when a small amount of GST-DDX18 was used to pull down NOP132. We were unable to use larger amounts of GST-DDX18 because most of the <italic>E.coli</italic>-produced GST-DDX18 was insoluble. Although GRWD1 was detected in NOP132-associated complexes that were isolated from cell lysates, GST-GRWD1 was not able to bind NOP132 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, lane 2), suggesting that the association of GRWD1 with NOP132 occurs indirectly. Alternatively, it could require a co-factor that was not present in this <italic>in vitro</italic> system. Control GST did not pull down NOP132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, lane 1). Because NOP132 bound FLAG-DDX47 <italic>in vitro</italic>, the failure to identify NOP132 in the DDX47-associated complexes by mass spectrometry suggests that their association is transient or that NOP132 is only a minor component of DDX47-associated complexes.</p><p>Next, we examined whether NOP132 co-localized with DDX47, DDX18, RPL3, or KIAA0539/NOP254/C21orf108 in hamster cells. Each of the four proteins was fused with EGFP and transfected with DsRed-NOP132 into BHK21 cells. Fluorescence microscopy examination revealed that these four proteins co-localized with NOP132 in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Consistent with this finding, DDX47 localizes to the nucleolus under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Surprisingly, NOP132 co-localized with EGFP-RPL3, which was expected to be localized mainly in the cytoplasm. However, Andersen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) reported that RPL3 was detected in a proteomic analysis of the human nucleolus. Thus, it is likely that NOP132 co-localized with a nucleolar fraction of RPL3. We also observed that DDX18 and KIAA0539 localized to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). We believe that KIAA0539, which has some similarity to yeast Urb1p/Npa1, is a novel nucleolar protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), and therefore named it NOP254, based on its nucleolar localization and its molecular weight of 254 kDa. In addition, we confirmed the nucleolar localization of endogenous DDX47 and DDX18 by immunostaining using affinity purified polyclonal antibodies against each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of NOP132 and DDX47 in pre-rRNA processing</title><p>To examine the roles of NOP132 and its associated proteins in pre-rRNA processing, RNAi experiments of NOP132 and DDX47 were carried out. After introduction of the siRNAs to the cells, total RNA was purified and used for northern blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). RNAs from same number of cells (about 4000 cells) were loaded onto the gel to compare the amount of rRNAs and rRNA precursors in wild type, NOP132 RNAi-treated and DDX47 RNAi-treated cells. Downregulation of NOP132 slightly decreased 18S rRNA and rRNA precursors, including 45S/47S rRNA, suggesting that NOP132 have a role in rRNA processing. Likewise, downregulation of DDX47 also decreased the amounts of mature rRNAs and rRNA precursors in HeLa cells, suggesting that DDX47 is also involved in rRNA production. We cannot rule out possibility that some pre-rRNAs are degraded. We observed that the total amount of RNA per cell decreased on average about 30% in NOP132-downregulated cells and about 40% in DDX47-downregulated cells in three separate cell samples. It could be possible that this decrease in RNA was caused by a kind of stringent control [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>)], which might be induced by interruption of rRNA processing by downregulation of NOP132 or DDX47. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> shows that addition of NOP132 siRNA and DDX47 siRNA downregulated expression of their respective proteins. The amount of actin mRNA was also decreased in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, lowest panel), suggesting that DDX47 might function in mRNA splicing. Consistently, many proteins involved in mRNA splicing were found in DDX47-associated complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Next, we examined the association of DDX47 with rRNA precursors by transfecting 293 cells with FLAG-tagged DDX47. RNAs from the FLAG-DDX47-expressing cells were purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG and used for northern blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). FLAG-DDX47 associated with 32S, 30S, 26S, 17S rRNA precursors and 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs, suggesting that DDX47 is involved in early stages of pre-rRNA processing, probably after the primary rRNA transcript is synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Because DDX47 associated with both 30S and 32S rRNA precursors, DDX47 might be involved in 18S and 28S rRNA maturation. Consistent with this, DDX47 associated with both 18S and 28S rRNA maturation proteins, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, in which the functions of human proteins were deduced from the known functions of their yeast orthologs. We also examined the association of FLAG-tagged NOP132 with the rRNA precursors; however, we did not detect a significant amount of rRNA precursor (data not shown). This might be the result of a transient association of NOP132 with pre-rRNAs. As a control, we analyzed a non-tagged control strain in parallel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Proper nucleolus localization of DDX47 by NOP132</title><p>Inhibition of rRNA synthesis by actinomycin D results in re-localization of DDX47 from the nucleolus to the entire nucleus, along with other nucleolar proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Although DDX47 is localized exclusively in the nucleolus in quiescent cells, an anchoring protein for DDX47 in the nucleolus has not been identified. We examined the possibility that NOP132 acts as a nucleolar anchoring protein for DDX47. Reduction of NOP132 expression by siRNA caused DDX47 to localize to the nucleolar periphery, probably in the granular component (GC) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This result suggests that DDX47 can still be recruited to the nucleolus in the absence of NOP132 but that NOP132 is required for retention of DDX47 in the fibrillar center (FC) and/or dense fibrillar components (DFC) region of the nucleolus. When actinomycin D was applied to HeLa cells for 8 h, DDX47 localized uniformly throughout the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), suggesting that recruitment and retention of DDX47 to the nucleolus requires active transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). To confirm that NOP132 plays a role in binding and recruiting DDX47 to the FC or DFC region of the nucleolus, we used a FLAG-tagged NOP132 coiled-coil domain fragment (FLAG-Coil), which contains the minimum region required to interact with DDX47 (see Figure 7) but lacks the NLS; this form of NOP132 localized mainly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). When EGFP-DDX47 was expressed alone in 293 cells, most of the EGFP-DDX47 localized to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). When FLAG-Coil was transiently cotransfected with EGFP-DDX47 into 293 cells, EGFP-DDX47 distributed evenly in the nucleus and FLAG-Coil was distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, upper and lower panels). In some cells in which FLAG-Coil expression was low and DDX47 expression was high, the FLAG-Coil fusion mutant NOP132 protein was localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, middle panels). Thus, it appears that the subcellular localization of EGFP-DDX47 was influenced by the relative expression levels of the FLAG-Coil protein and EGFP-DDX47. Together, these results suggest that NOP132 is required for DDX47 to localize in the nucleolar-organizing region during ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>Next, we identified the DDX47 region responsible for subcellular localization using a series of EGFP-fused DDX47 deletion proteins in BHK21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>). Nuclear export or cytoplasmic retention signals were found to reside between amino acid residues 50 and 100. A NLS in the C-terminal region was found to reside between residues 400 and 456. A nucleolar localization region was predicted to be between amino acid residue 200 and the C terminus because the EGFP fusion protein containing the region from residue 200 to the C terminus had a nucleolar staining pattern but the EGFP fusion protein containing the region from residue 300 to the C terminus had lost its nucleolar localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). A search for known protein sequence motifs was performed with the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>); it revealed that the region from residue 200 to the C terminus of DDX47 contains the helicase superfamily C-terminal domain (HELICc) motif, which is found in a wide variety of helicases and helicase-related proteins. To examine whether the region that determines the nucleolar localization of DDX47 is the region that interacts with NOP132, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay using DDX47 as the bait and found that the same region of DDX47, residue 200 to the C terminus, was also responsible for binding to NOP132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and c</xref>). Thus, the NOP132-interacting region of DDX47 also functions as a nucleolar localization signal. This result is consistent with the idea that NOP132 is required for the proper nucleolar localization of DDX47. In contrast, NOP132 siRNAs did not affect the nucleolar localization of DDX18 (data not shown), suggesting that proteins other than NOP132 determine the nucleolar localization of DDX18.</p></sec><sec><title>NOP132 coiled-coil structure is responsible for binding to both DDX18 and DDX47</title><p>We used a yeast two-hybrid assay to further examine the region of NOP132 responsible for binding to DDX18 and DDX47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>). Serial deletion constructs of NOP132 were constructed in the vector pACT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) and subjected to &#x003b2;-galactosidase filter assays using DDX47 or DDX18 as bait. The results indicated that the region of NOP132 containing two coiled-coil structures was responsible for binding to both of the DDX proteins. The coiled-coil structure is known to mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions and subunit oligomerization [see review in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>)]. Because the region of DDX47 that interacts with NOP132 contains a HELICc motif (as described above), it is likely that the NOP132 coiled-coil motif interacts directly with the DDX47 HELICc motif. DDX18 also contains a HELICc motif at the C terminus, has high sequence similarity to DDX47 in that region, and interacts with NOP132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). The HELICc motif of DDX18 might also directly interact with the coiled-coil motif of NOP132. Because other DDX family proteins have an amino acid sequence similar to the HELICc motif, we examined the possibility that the other DDX family proteins also bind to NOP132. We performed yeast two-hybrid assays on DDX3, DDX5, DDX21, and DDX49; however, none of these DDX proteins interacted with NOP132 (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction with NOP132 is specific to DDX47 and DDX18.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>NOP132 and DDX47 are involved in human ribosome biogenesis</title><p>The present study demonstrates that NOP132 physically interacts and co-localizes with DDX47 and DDX18. Their associated complexes contained a number of proteins found in previously reported human pre-rRNP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). We also found that FLAG-tagged DDX47 associated with pre-rRNA precursors and RNAi-mediated downregulation of NOP132 resulted in mislocalization of DDX47. These results, coupled with the nucleolar localization of NOP132 and DDX47, strongly suggest that NOP132 and DDX47 are involved in human ribosome biogenesis cooperatively.</p><p>The yeast ortholog of human DDX47 is Rrp3 (identity, 57%), which plays a role in the cleavage of A0 (the 5&#x02032; external transcribed spacer), A1 (the 5&#x02032; end of the 18S rRNA) and A2 (located 1.9 kb away in ITS1) and in the processing of pre-rRNA, and is required for 18S rRNA production in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Although it was reported that the yeast ortholog of human DDX47 is Prp3 with 56% identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), we did not find such identity between these proteins. DDX18 also potentially has several roles in early ribosome biogenesis: it is similar to yeast Has1 (identity, 60%), which is a component of 90S and pre-60S ribosomal particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), is an essential trans-acting factor involved in 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), is a direct target of MYC in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), and is essential for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Because both Has1 and Rrp3 are essential for growth and are involved in rRNA production, DDX18 and DDX47 might have similar functions in mammalian cells. We observed that FLAG-tagged DDX47 interacts with 30S and 32S pre-rRNAs, suggesting that DDX47 is involved in early steps in pre-rRNA processing. It is likely that a main role of DDX47 could be in 60S ribosome subunit assembly, because DDX47 associates more efficiently with pre-rRNAs from 26S to 5.8S pathway as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>.</p><p>RNase treatment released most of the proteins of the NOP132-, DDX47-, and DDX18-associated complexes, demonstrating that NOP132-, DDX47-, and DDX18-associated complexes contain RNAs, which could act as assembly factors. Because DDX47 and DDX18 belong to the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, it is likely that these proteins directly bind to RNAs that link to other proteins. NOP132 also has an RNA binding motif in its amino terminal region that can bind RNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> (T.Sekiguchi <italic>et al</italic>. unpublished data) and thus may directly bind to RNAs. Association of NOP132 with DDX47 or DDX18 was also dependent on RNA, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, although we cannot rule out the possibility that NOP132 directly associates with either DDX47 or DDX18.</p></sec><sec><title>A possible role for NOP132 in proper nucleolus localization of DDX47 during ribosome biogenesis</title><p>It is thought that within the nucleolus, there are subcompartments for vectorial maturation of pre-ribosomes, with the transcription of the rDNA occurring at the interface between the FCs, where nascent transcripts reach out into the body of the DFC into the GC, as pre-rRNA processing occurs [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>)]. With downregulation of NOP132, DDX47 appeared to be localized to the GC, but not to either the FC or DFC, suggesting that DDX47 is localized at the nucleolar periphery (probably the GC region) in the absence of NOP132 and that DDX47 might be retained in the FC or DFC in the nucleolus by NOP132 during ribosome biogenesis. Consistently, FLAG-tagged DDX47 associated with 30S and 32S pre-rRNAs in the cell, indicating that DDX47 has a role in primary pre-rRNA processing.</p><p>It has been reported that NOP132/NOL8 is upregulated in diffuse-type gastric cancer and that downregulation of NOP132 induces apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), suggesting that NOP132 is involved in carcinogenesis. We found that p53 co-precipitated with FLAG-NOP132. Although the association of NOP132 with p53 is suggestive, it is possible that overexpression of NOP132 is a consequence rather than an effector of carcinogenesis.</p><p>It was also reported that NOP132/NOL8 is a phosphoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Consistently, NOP132 associated with several kinases that are involved in signal transduction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, these kinases might phosphorylate NOP132 and influence its function. It is also possible that NOP132 regulates DDX47 helicase activity either positively or negatively by associating with these kinases. Such is the case for telomere repeat binding factor (TRF) proteins and Bloom syndrome (BLM) helicase; the interaction of TRF1 and TRF2 with BLM has been reported to stimulate the BLM helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>).</p><p>The structure of the DEAD-box RNA helicases indicates that the HELICc domain is located downstream of the helicase domain (DEADc). In the HELICc domain, there are three conserved DEAD-box RNA helicase motifs, IV, V, and VI, within the HELICc domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), that possibly function in substrate and &#x003b3; phosphate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). The region containing the HELICc motif of DDX47 interacted directly with the coiled-coil motif of NOP132 and was responsible for the nucleolar localization of the DDX47-EGFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Because DDX18 has a high level of amino acid identity with DDX47, especially in the HELICc motif, it is possible that both proteins interact with NOP132 through this motif. Although another DEAD-box RNA helicase, DDX21, was also found in the NOP132 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), direct interaction between DDX21 and NOP132 was not detected by yeast two-hybrid analysis (data not shown), suggesting that DDX21 binds to the NOP132 complex through interactions with other proteins or RNAs.</p><p>We previously reported that NOP132 could be the human counterpart of yeast Nop8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Because Nop8-depleted cells contain reduced levels of free 60S ribosomes and polysomes and accumulate half-mer polysomes, Nop8 is probably involved in 60S ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Recently, it was reported that yeast Nop8 functionally interacts with DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp6, which also interacts with Rpl3 and Rsa3, as shown by synthetic lethal mutant screening, and is involved in 60S ribosomal subunit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Dbp6 interacts with another DEAD-box RNA helicase, Dbp9, which is also involved in 60S ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). A region of high similarity in amino acid sequences between NOP132 and Nop8 encompasses the DDX47-interacting region of NOP132, suggesting functional conservation between the two proteins and the involvement of NOP132 in 60S ribosome biogenesis. With regard to this possibility, we demonstrated that NOP132 associates with a novel nucleolar protein, NOP254/NNP72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), which is a human ortholog of yeast Npa1, which is a component of very early pre-60S ribosomal particles. Consistently, Npa1 is shown to associates with Nop8 and other nucleolar proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Together these data suggest that NOP132 participates in various stages of human ribosome biogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec>

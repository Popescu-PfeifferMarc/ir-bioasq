A dual tet-repressor/activator system tightly controls a bi-directional promoter, which simultaneously drives expression of microRNAs and a fluorescent marker protein. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this vector by knockdown of p53 expression in a human cell line which resulted in the expected loss of G<sub>1</sub>-arrest after DNA damage. The generation of a cell pool homogenously expressing the ectopic microRNAs was achieved in 1 week without the need for viral infections. Induction of microRNA expression did not elicit an interferon response. Furthermore, the vector was adapted for convenient ligation-free transfer of microRNA cassettes from public libraries. This conditional knockdown-system should prove useful for many research and gene therapeutic applications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA interference is a process which leads to degradation of endogenous mRNA via formation of duplexes with small non-coding RNAs. The application of RNA interference has revolutionized the functional analysis of genes and may also facilitate gene therapeutic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Several different strategies have been devised to achieve RNA interference in cells. For example, synthetic short interfering RNAs (siRNA) of 21 nt can be efficiently transfected into cells. Alternatively, transfection of plasmids encoding shRNAs (short hairpin), which are processed to siRNAs by the enzyme DROSHA, is commonly used. It is possible to achieve up to 90% reduction in expression of the respective protein by RNA interference. Transiently introduced siRNAs are effective for up to 5 days as they are degraded with time and diluted during cell divisions. For permanent gene inactivation it is necessary to stably integrate plasmids driving the expression of shRNAs into the genome of the respective target cell. Initially, RNA polymerase III (Pol III) promoters were used to mediate permanent shRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Recently, Pol II promoters have been employed to drive the expression of precursor microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The constitutive expression of siRNAs may however compete with endogenous microRNAs, leading to toxic side effects.</p><p>For the biochemical and functional analysis of essential genes conditional approaches are necessary. Furthermore, the analysis of isogenic cell populations which only differ in the activation state of a conditional allele has advantages when compared to the analysis of cells permanently expressing a knock-down construct. In the latter case multiple clones obtained by tedious single cell cloning and expansion have to be analyzed to avoid clonal variations. In addition, the long-term down-regulation of proteins by stable knock-down strategies may lead to compensatory activation of parallel pathways, obscuring the initial effect of the gene-specific inactivation. Therefore, the conditional activation of microRNA expression provides significant advantages.</p><p>Although a number of systems for conditional gene expression have been developed, the Tet-repressor system was most widely applied in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). In this system elements of the bacterial <italic>tet</italic> operon were transferred into mammalian cells: the tet-repressor was fused to the VP16 transactivation domain (tTA). In the presence of tetracycline or its derivative doxycycline (DOX) this fusion protein will not bind a promoter which harbors a tet-repressor binding site. Later a mutant tet-VP16 fusion was developed which only binds to DNA in the presence of DOX (rTA, reverse tetracycline controlled transactivator) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In many cases the leakiness of the regulated promoters has presented a problem. This can be avoided by the simultaneous expression of a tet-repressor fused to the KRAB protein (tTS<sup>KRAB</sup>), which keeps the inducible gene inactive in the absence of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Bornkamm <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) combined recently the rTA and tTS<sup>KRAB</sup> in the episomal pRTS-1 vector, which allows conditional expression of cDNAs in mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate that the pRTS-1 vector can be used to conditionally regulate the expression of microRNAs mediating RNA-interference, thereby providing a convenient tool to determine gene functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines/culture and reagents</title><p>U2OS osteosarcoma cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100IE)/streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml).

In brief, the donor bacterial strain (DH10&#x003b2;F&#x02032;DOT sbcC, PIR1 positive) was transformed with a p53-specific pSM2c vector and grown on kanamycin (30 &#x003bc;g/ml) containing Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB) plates at 37&#x000b0;C.

These microRNAs are publicly available and are provided in the pSHAG-MAGIC 2c (pSM2c) retroviral vector (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/RNAi"/>), which provides constitutive expression driven by a long-terminal repeat (LTR). Here, we have chosen several microRNA cassettes from the human library for transfer from pSM2c vectors to the pRTS-1 vector. Since pRTS is a relatively large vector (&#x0223c;18 kb) the intermediate pUC19-based shuttle vector pSHUMI (plasmid for shuttling microRNAs) is necessary for the transfer procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For a faster transfer of microRNAs we also adapted the pRTS vector to the ligation-free MAGIC technique (mating-assisted genetically integrated cloning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The resulting pEMI (plasmid for episomal microRNA expression; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) harbors a <italic>pheS</italic> Gly294 allele encoding a tRNA synthase for phenylalanine with relaxed specificity, which incorporates toxic chloro-phenylalanine and thereby facilitates selection against non-recombinant clones. Bacteria containing the pEMI-recipient vector were conjugated with bacteria containing a pSM2c vector encoding a p53-specific microRNA. Of 80 resulting bacterial colonies 79 (98.7%) harbored pEMI vectors containing the p53-microRNA as determined by colony PCR (data not shown). Successful recombination was also confirmed by restriction and sequence analysis (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional evaluation of pEMI vectors</title><p>The human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS was transfected with pEMI vectors encoding either p53- or MAD2-specific or non-silencing microRNAs, which do not recognize any human mRNA. Selection for cells containing the pEMI vectors with hygromycin B was completed within 7 days. The resulting pools of resistant cells were analyzed for RT&#x02013;PCR analysis to determine the expression of the ectopic microRNA after addition of doxycycline (DOX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In the absence of DOX no MAD2-specific microRNA was detected after 30 PCR cycles. However, 24 h after addition of DOX the microRNA was expressed. By 48 h the expression increased further as determined by quantitative PCR (data not shown). As no microRNA expression was detected in the absence of DOX, these results show that the pEMI vectors mediate an extremely stringent control over microRNA expression. In line with this observation the cell pools were consistently devoid of mRFP expression in the absence of DOX as determined by live cell fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Within 24 h after addition of DOX approximately half of the cells were positive for mRFP at 3.2 ng/ml DOX and virtually all cells were positive at 25 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Even at only 0.8 ng/ml DOX a decrease in p53 protein levels was observed within 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). At a DOX concentration of 25 ng/ml the degree of p53 down-regulation and frequency of mRFP-positive cells reached its maximum and p53 protein was hardly detectable. Similar results were obtained with microRNAs specific for <italic>MAD2</italic>, although the maximal down-regulation of MAD2 was reached at higher DOX-concentrations, presumably due to the different half-lives of p53 and MAD2 or varying efficiencies of the respective microRNAs. Induction of a non-silencing microRNA did not affect the levels of p53 protein. In a time course analysis the level of p53 protein began to decrease one day after induction of the p53 microRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). At 5 ng/ml DOX the maximum knock-down was reached after 2&#x02013;3 days. After a 48 h exposure to DOX, its removal led to complete restoration of p53 expression within 6 days which was paralleled by the disappearance of mRFP as determined by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>When p53 was activated by treatment with the DNA damaging agent etoposide, an increase in the levels of p53 and its target p21 was observed within 3.5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Induction of the p53-specific microRNA 2 days before etoposide addition resulted in strong suppression of p53 and prevented any significant increase in p53 and p21 protein after DNA damage. A control cell population expressing a non-silencing microRNA showed normal stabilization of p53 and p21 induction after addition of etoposide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Furthermore, a flow cytometric analysis revealed that suppression of p53 inhibited arrest in the G<sub>1</sub> phase upon etoposide treatment, whereas in the absence of p53-specific microRNAs, or upon expression of the non-silencing microRNA cells arrested normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p>As an example for the inactivation of an essential gene by the system introduced here we conditionally down-regulated the expression of the MAD2 protein, which was shown to result in mitotic failure and extensive cell death when permanently inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). After introduction of the pEMI-plasmid encoding a MAD2-specific microRNA we observed no effect on the viability and cell cycle distribution. Only when MAD2 was down-regulated by addition of DOX an increased fraction of apoptotic cells and altered cell cycle distribution was observed (data not shown). These results show that the expression of microRNAs can be tightly controlled using pEMI vectors, which are therefore useful for studying essential genes.</p><p>To rule out toxic side effects mediated by the pEMI vector-driven microRNA expression, we analyzed the expression of the <italic>IFIT1</italic> (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) gene by qPCR. Others have shown that expression of <italic>IFIT1</italic> mRNA is rapidly induced upon IFN treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Besides interferon, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and viral infection have been shown to increase the expression of <italic>IFIT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). pEMI-driven expression of a non-silencing microRNA for 2 and 4 days did not provoke an increased <italic>IFIT1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Also expression of a p53-specific microRNA did not lead to any increase in <italic>IFIT1</italic> expression, whereas transfection of U2OS cells with a synthetic dsRNA [poly(I:C)] led to &#x0223c;40-fold increase in <italic>IFIT1</italic> mRNA expression within 18 h after transfection. Incubation of U2OS cells in media containing poly(I:C) also increased the level of <italic>IFIT1</italic> up to &#x0223c;7-fold (data not shown) indicating this cell line is in principle very sensitive towards the presence of dsRNA. Furthermore, proliferation assays showed no significant anti-proliferative effect of pEMI-driven microRNA over-expression and cells were viable for several weeks when expressing microRNAs not targeting essential genes, whereas treatment with poly(I:C) led to an apoptotic response 2 days post transfection presumably by activating the dsRNA response (data not shown). Taken together, expression of ectopic microRNA by pEMI vectors does not lead to a dsRNA response or other toxic side effects.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A number of different conditional systems for RNA interference have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). They utilize tetracycline regulation or CRE-recombinase mediated activation of shRNAs or microRNAs). However, they rely on several separate plasmids providing the necessary regulators <italic>in trans</italic>. One major advantage of the system described in this manuscript lies in the possibility to establish cells exhibiting inducible knock-down of the gene/protein of interest in one step as all components have been integrated on a single vector. This feature facilitates the analysis of cells which are characterized by a low transfection efficiency or a limited life span which presumably applies to most primary cells. With this vector system we could generate cell pools which homogenously express the microRNA of interest in an inducible manner in only one week. Furthermore, the analysis is not restricted to a cell clone expressing the trans-regulator (tTA or CRE) at the appropriate level. Instead, a pool of different cells expressing the pEMI vector can be analyzed. Obviously, this provides significant advantages and protects against misleading clonal effects.</p><p>The vector system employed here is episomal and therefore microRNA expression levels are not dependent on the site of integration. Furthermore, the combination of a repressor and an activator acting through the tet-operon prevents expression in the off-state and allows precise titration of the expression level of the respective microRNA. Our determination of ectopic microRNA expression validate this point, as we were unable to detect expression in the uninduced state. The pEMI vector allows the conditional knockdown of proteins within a short period without the need for viral infection procedures or repeated transfections of several plasmids encoding the different components of the system. The expression of a fluorescent protein from the bidirectional promoter allows transfected cells to be sorted by flow cytometry, circumventing single cell cloning. Furthermore, cells exhibiting RNA interference can be traced in a heterogeneous population of cells in cell culture or in animals. In addition, the fluorescent protein marker facilitates the detection of any potential loss of microRNA expression in a cell population. Therefore, laborious, parallel analyses to confirm microRNA expression or its effects on the targeted gene are not necessary for every experiment. A further useful feature of this system is the possibility to reverse the knockdown and hence the induced phenotype. Thereby the causal link between the knockdown of any gene and the observed phenotype can be strengthened as non-reversible phenotypes may represent secondary effects.</p><p>We observed different degrees of inducibility over time in different cell lines. Whereas U2OS and H1299 cells showed a decrease of inducibility after 4 weeks of passaging, MCF7 cells did not show any decrease in the frequency of inducible (mRFP-positive) cells after several month of propagation. Cells which show loss of expression after continued passaging should therefore be conserved by freezing at early passages.</p><p>Mammalian cells discriminate between microRNAs that are endogenous DICER products and non-self dsRNAs, e.g. by-products of viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The microRNAs which were used here are embedded in an authentic human miRNA miR30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). This human microRNA has been shown to be efficiently recognized and processed by the Drosha&#x02013;DGCR8 complex and DICER in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and therefore should not induce non-specific effects that are triggered by viral dsRNAs, as, for example, activation of the interferon pathway. A commonly used and sensitive marker for the activation of these dsRNA signaling pathways leading to IRF-3 and IFN induction is the increased expression of the dsRNA induced protein 56K (p56) encoded by the <italic>IFIT1</italic> (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Expression of p56 has furthermore been closely linked to the general toxicity of distinct siRNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). We found that neither non-silencing microRNA nor a p53-specific microRNA expressed by the episomal pEMI vector triggered a dsRNA pathway response.</p><p>The controlled inactivation of genes by the system introduced here may be useful in certain therapeutic regimes and prevent the potential toxicity or immunogenicity which has been discussed for therapeutic applications of ectopic RNA interference. Using the bi-directional promoter it may be possible to express an RNA interference resistant wild-type protein to substitute for a mutant protein, which is simultaneously down-regulated by the ectopic microRNA. A similar approach has been recently described for the treatment of sickle cell anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). As described above the pEMI vector is compatible with recently generated microRNA libraries and will therefore presumably become a widely used tool for conditional RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Georg Bornkamm for providing the pRTS-1 plasmid, Stephen Elledge for MAGIC and Ross Dickins and Scott Lowe for LMP vectors and Gunter Meister for technical advice.

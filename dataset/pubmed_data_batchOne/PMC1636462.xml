Site-specific mutagenesis studies indicate that oxazolone is a strongly mispairing lesion, inducing &#x0223c;10-fold more mutations than 8-oxo-dG. While 8-oxo-dG undergoes facile further oxidation, oxazolone appears to be a stable final product of guanine oxidation, and, if formed <italic>in vivo</italic>, can potentially serve as a biomarker of DNA damage induced by oxidative stress. In this study, capillary liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) methods were developed to enable quantitative analysis of both 8-oxo-dG and oxazolone in DNA from biological sources. Sensitive and specific detection of 8-oxo-dG and oxazolone in enzymatic DNA hydrolysates was achieved by isotope dilution with the corresponding <sup>15</sup>N-labeled internal standards. Both nucleobase adducts were formed in a dose-dependent manner in calf thymus DNA subjected to photooxidation in the presence of riboflavin. While the amounts of oxazolone continued to increase with the duration of irradiation, those of 8-oxo-dG reached a maximum at 20 min, suggesting that 8-oxo-dG is converted to secondary oxidation products. Both lesions were found in rat liver DNA isolated under carefully monitored conditions to minimize artifactual oxidation. Liver DNA of diabetic and control rats maintained on a diet high in animal fat contained 2&#x02013;6 molecules of oxazolone per 10<sup>7</sup> guanines, while 8-oxo-dG amounts in the same samples were between 3 and 8 adducts per 10<sup>6</sup> guanines. The formation of oxazolone lesions in rat liver DNA, their relative stability in the presence of oxidants and their potent mispairing characteristics suggest that oxazolone may play a role in oxidative stress-mediated mutagenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, superoxide, peroxynitrite and singlet oxygen, are produced in normal tissues as a result of aerobic metabolism, immune response and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The oxidative degradation of DNA has been implicated in aging, cancer and in some degenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). For example, smokers who exhibit low levels of hOgg1, a repair protein responsible for the removal of oxidative DNA lesions, are at an increased risk of lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Among the four DNA bases, guanine is most susceptible to oxidation because it has the lowest oxidation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Guanine oxidation is further facilitated in the GG and GGG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Guanine oxidation gives rise to a variety of products, including 8-oxo-dG, spiroiminodihydantoin, guanidinohydantoin, 2-amino-5-[2-deoxy-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro</italic>-pentofuranosyl)amino]-4<italic>H</italic>-imidazol-4-one (imidazolone) and its hydrolysis product, 2,2-diamino-4-[(2-deoxy-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro</italic>-pentofuranosyl)amino]-5(2<italic>H</italic>)-oxazolone (oxazolone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch1">Scheme 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>Oxidized DNA nucleobases measured in target tissues can serve as biomarkers of oxidative stress and potentially, carcinogenic risk indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). 8-Oxo-dG is commonly used as a marker of DNA oxidation, mainly because of its prevalence and the ease of its measurement by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). For example, 8-oxo-dG levels have been reported to be increased in leukocyte DNA of smokers as compared with non-smoking controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). 8-Oxo-dG, however, is also produced as an artifact from normal 2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine during sample processing, leading to overestimation of its amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Large discrepancies in the levels of 8-oxo-dG determined by different laboratories are likely due to differences in analytical procedures including DNA extraction, hydrolysis and derivatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>The use of 8-oxo-dG as a biomarker of DNA oxidation is further complicated by its facile oxidation in the presence of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Since 8-oxo-dG has a lower redox potential than normal guanine (0.58&#x02013;0.75 V compared to 1.29 V for dG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), it is preferentially oxidized even in the presence of a large excess of normal guanines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). 8-Oxo-dG has been proposed to act as a &#x02018;trap&#x02019; for oxidative damage via the free radical or electron hole migration to 8-oxo-dG along the DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). In the event that 8-oxo-dG is specifically targeted for further oxidation <italic>in vivo</italic> upon long-term exposure of cellular DNA to oxidants, its use as a biomarker of oxidative stress may be misleading. On the other hand, the secondary products resulting from further oxidation of 8-oxo-dG, e.g. oxazolone, oxaluric acid, cyanuruc acid, guanidinohydantoin, 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole and urea, are mispairing lesions that may, in turn, play a role in mutagenesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).</p><p>Oxazolone is generated <italic>via</italic> spontaneous hydrolysis of imidazolone, which can be produced directly by oxidation of guanine nucleobases in DNA or as a secondary oxidation product with an intermediate of 8-oxo-dG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch1">Scheme 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Imidazolone and oxazolone lesions have been found in DNA following exposure to Type I photo-oxidizing agents, ionizing radiation, superoxide radicals and peroxynitrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Kino and Saito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) proposed that imidazolone and oxazolone nucleosides may be responsible for the formation of piperidine-sensitive alkali-labile sites at the 5&#x02032;-guanine of 5&#x02032;-GG-3&#x02032; sequences following one-electron oxidation of DNA. These and other investigators have shown that synthetic DNA oligomers containing oxazolone are quantitatively cleaved by hot piperidine treatment at the oxidized nucleotide, while the strand scission of the corresponding 8-oxo-dG-containing oligonucleotides is inefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Therefore, oxazolone formation may be the underlying basis for the formation of single-strand breaks following hot piperidine treatment of ROS-treated DNA, a procedure commonly used to assess oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).</p><p>Primer extension studies and site-specific mutagenesis experiments using synthetic oxazolone-containing DNA indicate that oxazolone is at least an order of magnitude more mutagenic than 8-oxo-dG, giving rise to G&#x02192;T transversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). This suggests that, if formed <italic>in vivo</italic>, oxazolone may play a role in oxidative stress-related mutations and cancer. Yu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) reported recently the use of HPLC-MS/MS to quantify oxazolone lesions in calf thymus DNA treated with varying concentrations of peroxynitrite. However, to our knowledge, there are no previous reports of oxazolone formation in cellular DNA. It is possible that oxazolone has not been detected among DNA lesions <italic>in vivo</italic> because of its low yield as compared with 8-oxo-dG, its efficient repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), hydrolytic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) or insufficiently sensitive analytical methods for its detection.</p><p>The goal of the present investigation was to establish whether oxazolone lesions are present in cellular DNA and to determine their potential usefulness as a biomarker of DNA oxidation. Previous studies demonstrated that 8-oxo-dG and other oxidative lesions are present in normal tissues of humans and laboratory animals with no known exposure, probably as a result of background DNA oxidation by endogenous ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The present study uses liver DNA isolated from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats exhibiting high levels of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Our approach is based on sensitive and specific detection of 8-oxo-dG and oxazolone in enzymatic DNA digests by isotope dilution HPLC-ESI-MS/MS following a two-step off-line HPLC cleanup. Both 8-oxo-dG and oxazolone were detected in liver DNA of control and diabetic rats. The presence of oxazolone in DNA from an <italic>in vivo</italic> source suggests a possible role for this oxidative nucleobase lesion in mutagenesis induced by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Ammonium acetate, acetonitrile, methanol, magnesium dichloride and the Tris base (Fisher Scientific, Hanover Park, IL); calf thymus DNA, riboflavin, 8-oxo-dG, alkaline phosphatase, manganese(IV) oxide, TEMPO and 2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI); guanidine thiocyanate (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI); DNase I and Phosphodiesterases I and II (Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ); and <sup>15</sup>N<sub>5</sub>-dGTP (Martek, Columbia, MD) were from the sources indicated.

Potent mispairing abilities of oxazolone have been demonstrated in site-specific mutagenesis experiments, where it led to &#x0223c;10-fold more G to T transversions than 8-oxo-dG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that, if formed <italic>in vivo</italic>, oxazolone may play a role in mutagenesis by ROS.</p><p>The goal of the present study was to examine the occurrence of oxazolone in cellular DNA using highly sensitive and specific mass spectrometry-based methods. The analytical methodology developed in the present work allows a direct and accurate analysis of oxazolone in DNA samples from biological sources using stable isotope labeling - capillary HPLC-ESI<sup>+</sup>-MS/MS. Our HPLC-ESI-MS/MS limit of detection for oxazolone was estimated as 5 fmol, with an accuracy of 96.7 (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and a precision of 1.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 5). While this manuscript was in preparation, Yu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) reported the development of a similar HPLC-ESI-MS/MS assay for oxazolone and its application to quantitative analysis of this lesion in DNA subjected to peroxynitrite treatment. However, to our knowledge, no previous reports of the <italic>in vivo</italic> formation of oxazolone are available in the literature.</p><p>Our results for dose-dependent formation of oxazolone and 8-oxo-dG in photooxidized calf thymus DNA are consistent with the earlier report of Kino and Sagiyama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). These researchers employed HPLC with UV detection to monitor the formation of imidazolone and 8-oxo-dG in synthetic DNA duplexes irradiated in the presence of riboflavin. As in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the highest yields of 8-oxo-dG were observed at relatively short irradiation times, followed by a slow decline at prolonged irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). In contrast, Douki and Cadet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) observed a linear increase in the amounts of both oxazolone and 8-oxo-dG in photooxidized DNA with increased irradiation time. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by differences in irradiation times used in these studies. Indeed, Douki and Cadet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) stopped photooxidation at 20 min, i.e. before any non-linear behavior has been observed in our experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, this report provides the first account of the formation of oxazolone <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Although its levels were &#x0223c;10-fold lower than those reported for 8-oxo-dG in this and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>), oxazolone may be relevant for mutagenesis by ROS because of its mispairing potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) and its resistance to further oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The reason for the lack of a significant difference between oxazolone amounts detected in liver DNA of diabetic and control rats examined in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) is as yet unclear. Future experiments with other animal models of oxidative stress will employ quantitative HPLC-ESI-MS/MS methods developed in the present work to help establish whether oxazolone can serve as a biomarker of DNA oxidation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec>

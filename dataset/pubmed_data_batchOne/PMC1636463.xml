DSBs at TRS junctions with the vector generated a large number of mutagenic events in flanking sequences whereas DSBs within the repeats elicited no similar products. A substantial enhancement in the number of mutants was caused by transcription of the repeats and by the absence of recombination functions (<italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>recBC</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>). Surprisingly, DNA sequence analyses on mutant clones revealed the presence of only single deletions of 0.4&#x02013;1.6 kb including the TRS and the flanking sequence from plasmids originally containing (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<sub>43</sub> but single, double and multiple deletions as well as insertions were found for plasmids originally containing (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n</sub> (where n = 43 or 70). Non-B DNA structures (slipped structures with loops, cruciforms, triplexes and tetraplexes) as well as microhomologies are postulated to participate in the recombination and/or repair processes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The genetic instabilities of TRS are involved in the etiology of approximately 20 hereditary neurological diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), fragile X syndrome (FRAX) and Huntington's disease [reviewed in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)]. Whereas large expansions of TRSs are most frequently observed in patient materials related to FRAX and DM1, deletion events of CGG&#x02022;CCG and their flanking sequences were also found in clinical cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) as well as intergenerational contractions of the CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats in DM1 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The molecular mechanisms responsible for these instabilities have been elucidated in simple genetically tractable systems, such as bacteria or yeast [reviewed in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>)] and later studies in mammalian systems have been important in revealing cell-specific factors. Using these strategies, DNA replication, recombination (especially gene conversion), and DNA repair (especially methyl-directed mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair) based mechanisms have been implicated. Furthermore, the capacity of the simple repeating sequences to adopt non-B DNA conformations (including slipped structures, cruciforms, DNA unwinding elements, tetraplexes, triplexes and sticky DNA [reviewed in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>)] have been implicated in virtually all of the proposed molecular mechanisms. These non-B DNA structures, no doubt, serve to impede the progression of DNA replication and/or transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and, thereby promote the genetic instabilities of the repeat sequences and, thus, to lead to pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>Prior investigations on the molecular mechanisms of the genetic instabilities in model systems (bacteria, yeast and cell culture) have revealed the expansions and/or deletions within the TRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) with no alterations in the DNA sequences, which flank the unstable repeats. However, recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) show that long tracts of CTG&#x02022;CAG, CCTG&#x02022;CAGG, GAA&#x02022;TTC, and an intronic poly(R&#x02022;Y) sequence from the PKD1 gene do cause the formation of gross deletions, inversions and other rearrangements involving the sequences which flank the repeats. DSBs in the DNA are intimately involved in the repair and/or recombination processes, which effect these gross deletions and genomic rearrangements. The DSBs may originate from <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage by restriction enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), radiation of biological materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) and drugs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). DSBs are the primary lesions responsible for mutagenesis, chromosomal rearrangements and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). These DSBs may be repaired by a mechanism in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> that generates products identical to those identified in mammalian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) in the absence of DNA homology. All organisms have developed pathways for repairing DSBs. In eubacteria, DSBs are repaired mainly by the RecBCD family of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Presumably, RecBC acts within a complex of other enzymes, including RecA and other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). The rejoining of DNA ends in <italic>E.coli</italic> by transforming cultures with linearized plasmids has been studied previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) and the most common product results from the ligation of the DNA ends to restore the original plasmid. Furthermore, deletions were also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we have investigated the role of DSBs within or near CGG&#x02022;CCG or CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat tracts in an <italic>E.coli</italic> plasmid system. Instabilities within the TRS as well as the flanking sequences were monitored. Surprisingly, we found different types of mutagenic patterns for these two repeat sequences. For the former sequence, only single deletions were observed but DSB repair at the latter sequence induces single, double and multiple deletions as well as inversions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title><italic>E.coli</italic> strains</title><p>All cloning was done in <italic>E.coli</italic> HB101 (F<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, &#x00394;(gpt-proA)62, leuB6, glnV44, ara-14, ga/K2,lacY1, &#x00394;(mcrC-mrr), rpsL20, (Str<sup>R</sup>), xyl-5, mtl-1, recA13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).

Due to the high instability of the CGG&#x02022;CCG tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) during the TRS construction from the four single synthetic oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), the longest sequence obtained contained 43 repeats; the numbers of repeats for the CTG&#x02022;CAG sequence were 43 and 70. These tracts were created to contain a unique EcoRI recognition site inside the TRS and a unique EcoRV recognition site at the junctions of the CGG&#x02022;CCG or CTG&#x02022;CAG tracts with the vectors, which were used to induce DSBs <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>The pGFPT vector (previously called pRW3619) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), which contains a transcription terminator cassette was employed for all cloning. However, pGFPT has an EcoRI recognition site downstream of the <italic>GFP</italic> gene; therefore, to induce DSBs only within the TRS, we destroyed this restriction recognition site as follows. The vector was cleaved with EcoRI (all restriction enzymes used in this study were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and the 5&#x02032; overhang was filled-in with the Klenow fragment of <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA polymerase I (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and the product was ligated for 16 h at 16&#x000b0;C with 20 U of T4 DNA ligase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) in the presence of 1 mM ATP. The ligation mixture was ethanol-precipitated and transformed into <italic>E.coli</italic> HB101 by electroporation (2.5 kV, cuvette size 0.2 mm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) in a Stratagene Electroporator 1000 and cells were spread onto Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin (Amp). The transformants were screened using a model 3-6000 Fotodyne hand-held long wavelength ultraviolet (UV) lamp and single colony-forming units (CFUs) with a functional <italic>GFP</italic> gene were used to inoculate a liquid culture (in 10 ml LB medium at 37&#x000b0;C at a shaking rate of 250 r.p.m.). Subsequently, the plasmids from these CFUs were isolated by alkaline lysis using a Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA was digested with EcoRI and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel to identify clones lacking this GAATTC site. The undigested clone was called pGFPT&#x00394;E where the destroyed EcoRI site was also confirmed by DNA sequencing using the forward primer GGATCCGTTCAACTAGCAG at position 808 and the reverse primer CAAGCTGTGACCGTCTCC at 1165 in the plasmid map. All primers used in this study were purchased from Sigma Genosys, The Woodlands, TX. For the sequencing reactions, the primers and DNA were used at a concentration of 10 pmol/&#x003bc;l and 200 ng/&#x003bc;l, respectively. Cycle sequencing conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 96&#x000b0;C for 5 min, 25 cycles of heating (96&#x000b0;C, 10 s), annealing (50&#x000b0;C, 30 s) and elongation (60&#x000b0;C, 4 min). The DNA was sequenced in the Molecular and Human Genetics Sequencing Core at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. A GeneAMP PCR System 9700 and an ABI 3700 Sequencer were used.</p><p>pRW5503 and pRW5504 containing CGG&#x02022;CCG and pRW5511, pRW5512, pRW5509 and pRW5510 harboring CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were prepared and characterized as follows. To obtain inserts in orientation I, where the (CGG)<sub>n</sub> or (CTG)<sub>n</sub> strands are the templates for leading strand synthesis, the TRS containing fragments from pRW4531, pRW4525 and pRW4523 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) were released by Acc65I and HincII digestions. These inserts had, in addition to the 43 CGG&#x02022;CCG repeats in pRW5503, the 43 CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats in pRW5511 and the 70 CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats in pRW5509, 13 bp of non-repetitive flanking sequences at the Acc65I site and 15 bp at the HincII site. The pGFPT&#x00394;E vector was digested with BsiWI and StuI because Acc65I and BsiWI have compatible sticky ends and HincII and StuI have blunt ends. On the other hand, for the plasmid preparations with the inserts in orientation II, where the (CGG)<sub>n</sub> or (CTG)<sub>n</sub> strands are the templates for lagging strand synthesis, the TRS containing fragments from pRW4531, pRW4525 and pRW4523 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) were released by XbaI and SmaI digestions. In addition to the 43 CGG&#x02022;CCG repeats in pRW5504, the 43 CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats in pRW5512 and the 70 CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats in pRW5510, these inserts had 7 bp of non-repetitive flanking sequences at the XbaI site and 12 bp at the SmaI site. These fragments were individually ligated to the pGFPT&#x00394;E vector digested with SpeI and StuI since XbaI and SpeI have compatible sticky ends and SmaI and StuI have blunt ends.</p><p>The parental digested plasmids pRW4531, pRW4525 and pRW4523 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) and the linearized pGFPT&#x00394;E vector were purified by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer [40 mM Tris&#x02013;acetate and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)]. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and the corresponding bands containing the TRS and the linearized vector were excised. The DNA was then eluted from the excised bands, purified by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Each of the purified inserts and the linearized vector were mixed at approximately a 10:1 molar ratio and ligated for 16 h at 16&#x000b0;C with 20 U of T4 DNA ligase in the presence of 1 mM ATP. Subsequently, the procedure was carried out as described earlier for the preparation of pGFPT&#x00394;E. The plasmids from single CFUs were isolated using Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA Purification System (as before). For individual clones, the lengths of the TRS were determined by digestion with MfeI and ApaI. The inserts were released and these fragments were then radiolabeled with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) and 1 U of the Klenow fragment of <italic>E.coli</italic> polymerase I was added; the fragments were then resolved on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, exposed to X-ray film and then analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Storm 820 with Image Quant software, Molecular Dynamics).</p><p>The confirmation of the orientation of the CGG&#x02022;CCG repeats in the sequencing reaction was very difficult because of the repetitive CG rich arrays, which cause extensive strand slippage and hairpin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Therefore, to improve the efficiency of this reaction, the plasmids harboring the CGG&#x02022;CCG repeats were first run on a 1% agarose gel and the bands were excised using a DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Due to the high resolving power of gel electrophoresis, any other interference in the sequencing reaction was minimized. Subsequently, the DNA was ethanol-precipitated and selected clones containing the full-length restriction fragments harboring the undeleted 43 CGG&#x02022;CCG and 43 or 70 CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats were also sequenced on both strands. The forward and reverse primers GGATCCGTTCAACTAGCAG and CAAGCTGTGACCGTCTCCG, respectively, were used. The locations of the forward primer were the same for pRW5503, pRW5504, pRW5511, pRW5512, pRW5509 and pRW5510 at map position 808. However, the positions of the reverse primers for both pRW5503 and pRW5511 were at 1320, for pRW5504 and pRW5512 at 1325, for pRW5509 at 1407 andpRW5510 at 1409. The concentrations of the primers and DNA employed and the cycle sequencing conditions were as stated above and sequenced in the same institute.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of linear DNAs</title><p>Supercoiled DNA from the control pGFPT&#x00394;E and pRW5503, pRW5504, pRW5511, pRW5512, pRW5509 and pRW5510 were prepared by the Maxiprep procedure for 1 l cultures and the DNA was purified by cesium chloride/ethidium bromide centrifugation overnight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Linear DNA was obtained by digestion of these plasmids with EcoRV or EcoRI at the unique sites neighboring and inside the TRS, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The control pGFPT&#x00394;E vector was digested with StuI and ApaI to induce DSBs, which correspond to a similar distance between these recognition sites and the <italic>GFP</italic> gene as in plasmids containing TRS and digested with EcoRV and EcoRI, respectively. We found no white CFUs after <italic>E.coli</italic> transformation with linear control pGFPT&#x00394;E as well as with circular vector (data not shown). Linearized vector and the plasmids harboring the CGG&#x02022;CCG or CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats were first run on a long 1% agarose gel using the DNA Gel Extraction Kit (as described before). Subsequently, the bands of linear DNAs were excised from the agarose gel and eluted in the Spectra/Por<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> regenerated cellulose dialysis membranes (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) using the modified TAE electrophoresis buffer [40 mM Tris&#x02013;acetate and 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)] from the DNA Gel Extraction Kit (as before). Immediately prior to collecting the buffer containing linear DNA, the electrode polarity was reversed for 1 min to loosen any DNA bound to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Subsequently, the DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extractions and then precipitated with ethanol.</p><p>The conditions of complete digestion of all plasmids were determined by long 1% agarose gel where only a single band of linear DNA was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). As a second control to determine the purity of the plasmids, each sample was rerun on both agarose gel and polyacrylamide gels. In the latter case, DNAs were radiolabeled with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dATP, exposed to X-ray film and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (as before). We found no contamination with circular DNA within the assay detection limit (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) were more sensitive to any possible contamination by residual circular DNA than this investigation due to the strategies involved; thus we have confidence in the purity of our linearized plasmids. All linear plasmids were immediately used for <italic>E.coli</italic> transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Transformation of supercoiled and linear plasmids containing CGG&#x02022;CCG or CTG&#x02022;CAG tracts into <italic>E.coli</italic></title><p>Supercoiled pGFPT&#x00394;E, pRW5503, pRW5504, pRW5511, pRW5512, pRW5509 and pRW5510 were transformed by electroporation as described above into each of the <italic>E.coli</italic> strains with different genetic backgrounds (JC5519, JC10287, KMBL1001 and AB1157) to evaluate the role of the host strains in the mutagenic process. To determine the fluorescent status of the colonies, the transformation mixtures were spread on LB agar plates containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml Amp and isopropyl &#x003b2;-D thiogalactoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 2 mM for studies in the presence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription. Parallel experiments were also carried out in the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription but including 100 &#x003bc;g/ml Amp and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin (Kan) where the <italic>E.coli</italic> strains were first transformed with the plasmid pI<sup>Q</sup>-kan as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) (B.

The viable green (intact <italic>GFP</italic> gene and flanking sequences) and white (mutated <italic>GFP</italic> gene and flanking sequences) CFUs were screened and counted from the transformation mixtures; however, the total number ofCFUs observed was dramatically reduced (by &#x0223c;50- to 100-fold), after <italic>E.coli</italic> transformation with the linear plasmids in comparison with their supercoiled forms (data not shown), as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). In all experiments, the CFUs from the linearized control pGFPT&#x00394;E were fluorescent green, indicating a functional <italic>GFP</italic> reporter gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, all white CFUs found in this assay must have been induced by the DSB repair events in plasmids containing the TRS. These CFUs were re-streaked three times on LB agar plates with Amp and IPTG (as described earlier) for experiments in the presence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription and with Amp and Kan (as before) in the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription to confirm a persistent white phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) (B.

Subsequently, the plasmids from these white CFUs were isolated by alkaline lysis using a Wizard Plus MiniPreps DNA Purification System for the sequencing reactions to determine the DNA breakpoints (Supplementary Table 1).

However, the determinations of the sequences of the mutant clones in plasmids containing the CGG&#x02022;CCG repeats was very difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>); therefore, we first used the DNA Gel Extraction Kit to improve the sequencing reactions. The forward and reverse primers of the white mutants of pRW5503, pRW5511, pRW5504, pRW5512, pRW5509 and pRW5510 were GCTTCCAGGGGGAAACGCCTG and CAGGGTTATTGTCTCAGT, respectively, with their positions at 3203 and 1658 for the first two plasmids; for the next two, the map positions were at 3208 and 1663 and for pRW5509 were at 3240 and 1744 and finally for pRW5510, were at 3242 and 1746, respectively. In some cases, additional forward and reverse primers, CCTGCGTTATCCCCTGATTCTG and GCATATGGTGCACTCTC, respectively, were used. For the first two plasmids, their positions were at 3378 and 1432; for next two DNAs at 3383 and at 1457 and for pRW5509 at map positions 3465 and at 1529 and for pRW5510 at 3467 and at 1531. The concentrations of the primers and DNA and the cycle sequencing conditions were as stated above and were sequenced in the same institute.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of non-B DNA structures at breakpoints in the deleted plasmids</title><p>Mutant clones with single, double and multiple deletions as well as with inversions were found in the sequencing data (Supplementary Table 1). Previous studies have shown that different types of repetitive elements coincide with DNA breakpoints, which may mediate mutagenic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) (B. Kosmider and R.D. Wells, manuscript in preparation). Therefore, we analyzed the sequences of the mutant clones to evaluate if the breakpoints were flanked by non-B DNA conformations. Supplementary Figure 1 shows that we found the presence of direct repeats, which may form slipped structures, mirror repeats capable of folding into triplex conformations, a tetraplex, a structure formed by a recombination event between sequences with loops, and inverted repeats known to form cruciforms. The latter was determined by the base pairing beyond the Mfold program at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/old/dna/form1.cgi"/> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>) to include G&#x02022;T pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). The sequences of 150 bp downstream and 150 bp upstream from the breakpoints were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The statistical <italic>z</italic>-test containing the Yates correction for continuity with the program SigmaStat 2.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was applied.

The statistical significance of mutagenic events was analyzed for TRS in all <italic>E.coli</italic> strains used in this study. First, the numbers of white CFUs were compared with the data for the control pGFPT&#x00394;E (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Second, the numbers of white CFUs in orientation I were compared with orientation II for each TRS length in the presence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) and in the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Strategy of investigation</title><p>Numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) describe the repair of DSBs introduced into plasmids but only three reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) considered the influence of DSBs introduced by restriction enzymes in plasmids harboring TRS. Moreover, the influence of these DSBs on the instability within the TRSs was determined but their effects on flanking DNA sequences were not analyzed in <italic>E.coli</italic>. Hence, we have evaluated the effect of DSBs which were introduced by restriction enzymes at or inside CGG&#x02022;CCG or CTG&#x02022;CAG repeating tracts on non-repetitive flanking DNA sequences in plasmids in <italic>E.coli</italic>. The experiments utilized the vector pGFPT&#x00394;E, which harbored the reporter <italic>GFP</italic> gene. The inserts were created to contain a unique EcoRI recognition site inside the CGG&#x02022;CCG or CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats in order to induce DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). These sequences also have a unique EcoRV recognition site at the junction of the vector with the TRS; therefore, this EcoRV site was utilized to linearize the DNAs to generate molecules with the repeat tracts at the ends after DSB inductions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>recBC</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and parental strains were used (&#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019;) to explore the genetic background involved in the repair process. Also, we conducted studies in the absence and in the presence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which enables an analysis of DSB repair events and the effects of both DSB repair and transcription, respectively. Transcription was induced by 2 mM IPTG and was inhibited by co-transformation with the pI<sup>Q</sup>-kan plasmid, which expressed a variant <italic>lacI</italic> allele overproducing the <italic>lacZ</italic> repressor (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019;); white and green CFUs, respectively, were counted.</p><p>Interestingly, no white CFUs, indicative of a functional loss of the neighboring <italic>GFP</italic> gene, were found in any experiments after transformation with plasmids containing the TRS cleaved with EcoRI (data not shown). A <italic>z</italic>-test was used to analyze all statistically significant differences including between the fractions of white CFUs detected after DSB induction at the TRS by EcoRV and the control, which was linearized pGFPT&#x00394;E (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, we also determined the number of white CFUs separately for orientations I and II of the TRS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). In orientation I, the (CGG)<sub>n</sub> or (CTG)<sub>n</sub> strand is the template for leading strand synthesis and in orientation II, these strands are the templates for lagging strand synthesis. Plasmids from the white CFUs induced by DSB induction by EcoRV at the TRS were isolated for DNA sequence determinations to characterize the breakpoints (Supplementary Table 1). Surprisingly, we observed different mutagenic patterns for the DSB repair products in plasmids containing the CGG&#x02022;CCG or the CTG&#x02022;CAG sequences (Figure 3; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).</p></sec><sec><title>DSBs introduced inside the TRS by EcoRI do not induce white CFUs</title><p>We previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) that DNA cleavage by EcoRI inside the repeat tract caused instabilities within the TRS; however, its influence on flanking sequences was not studied. Therefore, we determined if this digestion would enhance the induction of mutations in neighboring genes. Experiments were carried out in the presence and in the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription where the transformation mixture was spread on agar plates containing IPTG and Amp or Kan and Amp, respectively, (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019;). In control studies with linearized pGFPT&#x00394;E, no white CFUs were found. Interestingly, we also detected no white CFUs after transformation with plasmids containing (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<sub>43</sub>, (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>43</sub> or (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>70</sub> repeats (data not shown) digested with EcoRI within the tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results are in agreement with the observations that DSBs between two direct repeats increase the rate of recombination between the repeats with the concomitant deletion of the intervening sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). In previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>), single-strand annealing was proposed to explain the TRS shortening induced by DSBs introduced inside the tracts; however, no prior studies were conducted on mutations in the flanking DNA sequences in <italic>E.coli</italic>. Thus, these results are in accord with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DSBs introduced by EcoRV in CGG&#x02022;CCG repeats induce more white CFUs than in CTG&#x02022;CAG</title><p>Different types of TRSs and their lengths had a pronounced effect on repeat instabilities after DSB induction; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>) however, mutations in the flanking DNA sequences were not analyzed previously in bacterial cells. Therefore, experiments were carried out herein to determine if DSBs induced by EcoRV at (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<sub>43</sub>, (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>43</sub> or (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>70</sub> tracts would have an influence on the promotion of mutations in flanking DNA sequences in the presence and in the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019;). The linearized plasmids pRW5503, pRW5504, pRW5511, pRW5512, pRW5509 or pRW5510 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were transformed into <italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>recBC</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and the parental strains and the transformation mixtures were spread on agar plates. The total number of viable CFUs (white and green) were low, as reported previously after <italic>E.coli</italic> transformation with linearized DNA cleaved by restriction enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). No white CFUs were found after transformation of all strains with the control-linearized pGFPT&#x00394;E in the presence and in the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Hence, all white CFUs which were detected represent single mutagenic events from the repair of DSBs introduced into the plasmids at the TRSs.</p><p>To summarize the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, we found, first, a higher number of white CFUs was observed after DSBs were induced at the (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<sub>43</sub> tract than for the (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>43</sub> or (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>70</sub>. Second, these values were higher for the CTG&#x02022;CAG sequence containing 70 repeats than for the shorter tract harboring 43 repeats. Third, the highest fraction of white CFUs was detected in the <italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>recBC</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains in comparison with the parental strains. Fourth, a higher number of white CFUs were found in the presence than in the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription. Linear DNA has to convert into a circular supercoiled form in order for transcription and replication to start. Transcription and transcription-replication collisions should be downstream from the circularization step. Thus, our results indicate that the type and length of the TRS has an influence on the DSB repair involving flanking DNA sequences.</p><p>The number of white CFUs detected after DSB induction by EcoRV at the TRS may be underestimated because the mutant clones with deletions in the other direction on the plasmid involving ampicillin resistant and/or the origin of replication genes will not survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Note that in the presence and in the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription, DSBs introduced at the TRSs caused the lowest numbers of viable CFUs in <italic>rec</italic>A<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>rec</italic>BC<sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains which was also demonstrated in studies of the transformation efficiency of the linearized pBR322 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Simultaneously, the highest numbers of white CFUs were detected in these strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This is in agreement with our previous work where the largest instability within the TRS after DSB induction was also found in <italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>recBC</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains; however, their effect on flanking DNA sequences was not analyzed in this report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DSBs in TRSs induce mutations in an orientation dependent manner</title><p>The orientation dependent effect of the CGG&#x02022;CCG and CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat tracts in supercoiled plasmids transformed into <italic>E.coli</italic> on the induction of instability within the TRSs was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). Herein, we extend these analyses by evaluating the effects of the presence of the TRS at the DSBs and by measuring the mutagenic consequences in the sequences flanking the TRSs. In the presence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription, DSBs introduced at TRSs promoted a higher number of white CFUs in orientation II than in orientation I (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), higher numbers of white CFUs were in general also found in orientation II than in orientation I. However, for the (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<sub>43</sub> tract, differences in the numbers were detected only for AB1157. Finally, after introduction of DSBs into the (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>70</sub> and (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>43</sub> tracts, no statistically significant values were found for orientations II and I in all bacterial strains.</p><p>Thus, we conclude that the DSBs induced at the TRSs have an orientation dependent effect on the mutagenic events in neighboring genes in the presence and in the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription. This behavior may be caused by a proximity effect of the presence of the TRSs joined to the <italic>GFP</italic> in orientation II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) whereas, in orientation I, the TRS is distal to the reporter gene in the linear DNA. It is also possible that the number of white CFUs in the plasmids with the insert in orientation I was underestimated because the TRS was close to the ampicillin resistance gene which could cause plasmid loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The types of TRSs and their orientations influence the nature of mutagenic products</title><p>The types of mutagenic events in the flanking sequences induced by linearized DNA containing different types of TRSs were analyzed. Restriction mapping was carried out for 33 deleted clones; each clone represents a single mutagenic event (see &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019;). These products were derived from the six plasmids shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The sizes of the deletion events for plasmids digested with EcoRV at the CGG&#x02022;CCG sequence were in the range of 0.4&#x02013;1.6 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). For clones harboring the CTG&#x02022;CAG tracts, deletions were from 1.0 to 1.7 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D&#x02013;F</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the DSBs in the two TRS sequences induced different mutagenic patterns in the repair products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). First, when DSBs were introduced into the CGG&#x02022;CCG sequence, both small (&#x0003c;1.0 kb) and large (&#x02265;1.0 kb) deletions were detected but only large deletions were found at the CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats. Second, only single deletions were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) for all mutant clones derived from plasmids harboring the CGG&#x02022;CCG sequence. On the other hand, the DSBs at the CTG&#x02022;CAG tracts induced a broad spectrum of mutagenic events involving single deletions in 45% of the cases, double deletions in 10% of cases and multiple deletions in 10% of cases. Third, only DSBs introduced into the CTG&#x02022;CAG sequences caused DNA inversions which were found in 35% of the cases. These different types of mutations found for CGG&#x02022;CCG and for CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats suggest the involvement of different sequence and/or structure specific proteins in the repair pathways of DSBs, especially since we did not find any white CFUs after <italic>E.coli</italic> transformation with the linearized pGFPT&#x00394;E control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The influence of the repeat sequence on thetypes of products formed is surprising since scores of prior studies [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)] have revealed different extents of behaviors (e.g. deletions-expansions or repair-recombination reactions) but not different types of processes (to elicit different types of products).</p><p>In summary, we found an influence of the type, orientation and the length of the repeat tracts on the induction of the mutagenic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For (CGG&#x02022;CCG)<sub>43</sub>, only single deletions were identified in both orientations. For (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>43</sub> and (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>70</sub>, single, double and multiple deletions as well as inversions were detected (summarized in Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, for the former tract, single and double deletions were identified in both orientations and for the latter sequence single deletions were found in orientation I. In the other cases of the CTG&#x02022;CAG sequence containing 43 and 70 repeats, mutagenic events were found only for orientation II. Additionally, a length dependence was also found because double deletions were observed between 0 and 20% of the cases for (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>43</sub> and (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>70</sub> in orientation II, respectively. Similar correlations were observed for inversions where 57.1 and 60% of the cases were detected in orientation II for CTG&#x02022;CAG harboring 43 and 70 repeats, respectively. The orientation effect may be explained by the presence of CTG&#x02022;CAG tracts attached to the <italic>GFP</italic> gene in orientation II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Hence, the TRSs had a stronger mutagenic effect where the TRSs were in close proximity to the <italic>GFP</italic> reporter gene (Discussion). Three types of DSB repair products were found (Discussion); first, plasmids where the entire TRS was deleted, second, plasmids with shortened TRSs where the EcoRI recognition site inside the tract was deleted and third, plasmids where the TRS was shortened but the EcoRI recognition site was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequences and putative non-B DNA structures at breakpoints of mutant clones</title><p>Previous studies revealed that mutagenic events coincided with non-B DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the mutagenic spectra after <italic>E.coli</italic> transformation with linear DNAs containing the TRSs. The data are presented in the Supplementary Data. We found that the breakpoints coincided with sequences that may form cruciforms, triplexes, tetraplexes and slipped structures. Also, microhomologies between the breaks were found. A general model to describe these deletion events is presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The role of DSBs proximal to CTG&#x02022;CAG or CGG&#x02022;CCG repeats in plasmids on the genetic instabilities within the TRS or in flanking sequences was investigated. The DSBs were created <italic>in vitro</italic> by restriction endonuclease cleavage near the center of the TRSs or at the junctions of the TRSs and the vector. Unexpectedly, we discovered that different types of mutagenic events occurred at the TRSs at their junctions with the vector for the CGG&#x02022;CCG and CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats. Only single deletions were found for the plasmids containing CGG&#x02022;CCG whereas single, double and multiple deletions as well as inversions were found after DSB repair in plasmids harboring the CTG&#x02022;CAG tracts. The occurrence of mutant clones was higher in recombination-deficient mutant strains than in the parental strains. Also, when active transcription occurred across the TRSs, the mutagenic effect was substantially stimulated.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows a model for the mutagenic effects in flanking sequences which were observed after induction of DSBs into the plasmids by EcoRV cleavage at the TRSs. Several types of non-B DNA structures may occur at the repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Since the DSBs were caused before the transformation, their resulting repeat ends may be susceptible to various types of alterations: first, nuclease degradation; second, end-fraying, which can lead to (a) increased single-strand degradation of the repeat and (b) the formation of unusual DNA structures that are recognized and processed by repair and/or recombination enzymes and third, hairpin formation which would cause reiterative synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). The proteins involved are unknown at present but their actions result in deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), depending on the type of TRS. For the EcoRV cleaved molecules where the <italic>GFP</italic> reporter gene is distal from the TRS, we propose a looping back of the DNA structure to enable the interactions of non-B DNA structure-containing sequences to facilitate the mutagenic events. For all white CFUs, the <italic>GFP</italic> gene was not functional and, therefore, all or some of this gene was deleted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that the plasmid products contain: (A) no TRS; (B) a shortened TRS where the EcoRI site within the tract was also deleted; and (C) plasmids containing a part of the TRS with the EcoRI site retained.</p><p>Several types of non-B DNA structures may occur in linearized DNA that may facilitate recombination events. Studies with short oligonucleotides demonstrated that repeating tracts of CTG, CAG, CGG and CCG single-strands can form intrastrand duplex hairpin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). The presence of inverted repeats at the ends of linear DNA promoted the formation of hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>) and subsequently caused DNA rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>). These consequences were suggested to be the result of fraying and/or unwinding at the two free ends of DSBs, thereby, making them suitable substrates for repair and/or recombination enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Linear DNA with terminal inverted repeats may also be initially processed by endonucleases or helicase/nucleases which may promote rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>).</p><p>The length of the TRS influences its stability and mutagenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>). More white CFUs were found for (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>70</sub> than for (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>43</sub>. This shows that the longer repeat sequences were deleted with a higher frequency and/or more rapidly than the shorter tracts. Moreover, it is known that the DSB repaired DNAs (after recircularization) would be stably replicated and any repeat alterations would have occurred predominantly through erroneous DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Alternatively, it is also possible, even likely, that the number of white CFUs was underestimated in general because of possible mutations in the opposite direction on the plasmid (in the ampicillin resistance gene); since cells harboring these mutations are inviable, their quantitation was not possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>).</p><p>A higher fraction of white CFUs was found in orientation II than in orientation I after DSBs were introduced at the TRSs, probably because of the proximity of the TRS to the <italic>GFP</italic>. This result is likely due to the stronger effect of the repeat tracts on this gene when the repeats are close to <italic>GFP</italic>. When the repeat tracts are at the distal end to the <italic>GFP</italic> (orientation I), a looping of the DNA is apparently required to enable the TRS and this gene to interact in order to effect the recombination-repair step. Moreover, multiple deletions and inversions were found only after DSB repair of plasmids containing the CTG&#x02022;CAG sequence in orientation II. In a related study (B. Kosmider and R. D. Wells, manuscript in preparation), we found gross deletions and complex DNA rearrangements induced by the CGG&#x02022;CCG tract. However, the results presented herein were obtained from a different system, under different assay conditions and for a shorter CGG&#x02022;CCG tract.</p><p>Prior investigations demonstrated that when transcription is initiated on plasmids there is continuous requirement for topological constraint, since subsequent cutting with a restriction endonuclease abolishes or substantially reduces this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>). However, a higher number of mutant clones (white CFUs) were detected in the presence than in the absence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription for plasmids harboring CTG&#x02022;CAG and CGG&#x02022;CCG repeats in all strains. This enhancement of the mutagenicity of the TRSs may be due to: first, replication and transcription complex collisions since replication is faster in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>). Second, transcription modulates genetic instabilities by influencing the formation of non-B DNA structures within the TRSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>). Third, this effect could be dependent on other associated processes, such as translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and not on transcription alone. Previous work showed that the proportion of clones containing deletions in <italic>recBC</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains was higher than in the parental strains after transformation with linearized pBR322 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>). This result was explained by the fact that RecBCD is the major enzyme responsible for the transformability of the linearized DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>). We found that <italic>rec</italic> mutations decreased the occurrence of transformations, in general, and increased the fraction of white CFUs in comparison with the parental strains. The highest number of white CFUs was found in <italic>recBC</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strains for both TRSs. However, the number of deleted clones in <italic>rec</italic> mutant strains increased with increasing CTG&#x02022;CAG tract length and was higher for the CGG&#x02022;CCG than for the CTG&#x02022;CAG sequence. In <italic>recBC</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutants, the repair pathway is severely inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>), these mutants exhibit very low viability, and the RecA-dependent (or a related) pathway is involved in the absence of RecBCD proteins. It is also well established that <italic>recA</italic> mutants are hypersensitive to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>). Furthermore, null mutations in either the <italic>recA</italic>, <italic>recB</italic> or <italic>recC</italic> genes virtually eliminate DNA break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>). Thus the RecBCD pathway has a central role in the repair of linear DNA in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>).</p><p>Non-B DNA structures (slipped structures with hairpin loops, cruciforms, triplexes, tetraplexes and sticky DNA, etc.) are important factors in the generation of mutagenic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Our sequencing data show that DSB repair at CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat tracts induced breaks at multiple sites. Furthermore, the sites of the mutagenic events in the deleted clones' originally harboring CGG&#x02022;CCG or CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats coincided with the non-B DNA structures. Moreover, the presence of alternative structures formed by CGG&#x02022;CCG and CTG&#x02022;CAG tracts is well established and endonucleolytic cleavage in the DNA can be generated in the secondary structures [reviewed in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>)]. Furthermore, the presence of slipped structures within the repeat-containing end was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>) and a polarized/directional deletion effect was observed in COS1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>This <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> study was conducted to better understand the role of DSBs at specific loci in genetic instabilities. Our eventual goal is to understand the molecular processes of the genetic instabilities in humans as related to hereditary neurological diseases; however, to date, most mechanistic studies like the present contribution have, of necessity, been conducted in genetically tractable model systems (<italic>E.coli</italic> and yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>Different repair products obtained for the CGG&#x02022;CCG or CTG&#x02022;CAG tracts indicate the need to study of the role of other repeat sequences involved in DSB repair. This will allow a detailed analysis of the mechanism(s) by which each TRS may affect this process. Obviously, future investigations in mammalian systems are required to delineate the relevance of these findings to human diseases. If these mechanisms are operative in humans and if site specific DSBs can be induced <italic>in vivo</italic> in DNA, this approach could give new insights into the molecular mechanisms of instabilities and possibly serve as a basis for developing therapeutic strategies for the future.</p><p>These results show that different types of repair products are induced by DSBs at CGG&#x02022;CCG or CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat tracts. Thus, the two repeat sequences must utilize alternative mechanisms of DNA repair and involve different sequence and/or structure specific proteins in the processing of the cleaved DNA ends. Future studies will focus on the identification of the specific proteins or enzymatic systems involved in our proposed model.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.</p></sec>

The data which show significant differences are marked with asterisks.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>The effect of orientation of the CGG&#x02022;CCG or CTG&#x02022;CAG tracts on the number of white CFUs in the presence of <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription after formation of DSBs by EcoRV</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>E.coli</italic> strain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(CGG&#x02022;CCG)<sub>43</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>43</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>70</sub></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Orientation I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Orientation II</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Orientation I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Orientation II</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Orientation I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Orientation II</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">JC5519</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.3333</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.5882</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0156</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0545</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.1764</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.1860</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<italic>recBC<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic>)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24/72</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/17</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/64</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/55</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/51</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/43</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">JC10287</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.3170</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.3478</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0147</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0476</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.1020</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.125</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<italic>recA<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic>)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13/41</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/23</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/68</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/42</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/49</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/32</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KMBL1001</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0957<sup>*</sup></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.6114<sup>*</sup></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0041</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0049</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0051<sup>*</sup></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0227<sup>*</sup></bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29/303</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">107/175</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/243</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/202</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/196</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/264</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AB1157</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0890<sup>*</sup></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.3768<sup>*</sup></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0034</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0054</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.0740</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.1393</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26/292</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75/199</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/288</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/183</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12/162</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17/122</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The orientations of the inserts were explained in the legend to Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>.

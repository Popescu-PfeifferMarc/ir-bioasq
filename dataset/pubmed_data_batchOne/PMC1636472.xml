The three component substrate is characterized by single-stranded DNA target, an oligonucleotide probe, separated from a helper oligonucleotide by a one base gap. The oligonucleotide probe contains a non-fluorescent quencher at the 5&#x02032; end and fluorophore attached to the 3&#x02032; end through a special rigid linker. Fluorescence of the oligonucleotide probe is efficiently quenched by the interaction of terminal dye and quencher when not hybridized. Upon hybridization of the oligonucleotide probe and helper probe to their complementary target, the phosphodiester linkage between the rigid linker and the 3&#x02032; end of the probe is efficiently cleaved, generating a fluorescent signal. In this study, the use of the Endo IV assay as a post-PCR amplification detection system is demonstrated. High sensitivity and specificity are illustrated using single nucleotide polymorphism detection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nucleic acid assays utilizing cleavage enzymes to generate a fluorescent signal from dual-dye-labeled oligonucleotide probes have been extensively used in diagnostics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In these assays, the ability of fluorescent dyes to transfer energy absorbed from light to nearby molecules forms the basis of homogeneous nucleic acid based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In the unhybridized state the fluorophore and quencher are within close proximity, which allows the quencher to absorb energy from the fluorophore to affect quenching. The use of fluorogenic probes in a 5&#x02032;-nuclease polymerase assay, where the probe is enzymatically cleaved to release the fluorophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), is well known. The signal amplification reaction utilizes invasive cleavage with structure-specific 5&#x02032;-nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The method requires annealing of two oligonucleotides, called the upstream oligonucleotide and the probe, to a target sequence, which results in the formation of a unique substrate for the 5&#x02032;-nuclease. In the DNAzyme-PCR strategy the primer contains a target-specific sequence and harbors the antisense sequence of a 10&#x02013;23 DNAzyme. During amplification, amplicons are produced containing active sense copies of DNAzymes that cleave a reporter substrate included in the reaction mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). A target nucleic acid sequence can be amplified exponentially <italic>in vitro</italic> under isothermal conditions by using three enzymatic activities essential to retroviral replication: reverse transcriptase, RNase H (RNA cleavage) and a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Cycling probe technology represents a simple method for the detection of DNA target sequences, utilizing a chimeric DNA&#x02013;RNA&#x02013;DNA probe which is cleaved by RNase H when hybridized with its complementary target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA arise via spontaneous or mutagen-induced hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond, or through the repair activity of DNA glycosylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). If left unrepaired, AP sites are potentially lethal or mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). To cope with the deleterious consequences of AP sites, organisms possess AP endonucleases that initiate the repair of these DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Class II AP endonucleases initiate repair by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the 5&#x02032;-phosphodiester of an abasic site to generate a 3&#x02032;-OH group and a 5&#x02032;-abasic phosphate residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The substrate specificity of human apurinic endonuclease on synthetic substrate analogs has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Here we describe a novel endonuclease IV (Endo IV) assay substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) that mimics the abasic lesions that normally occur in double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The first lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is a typical abasic (apurinic or apyrimidinic site generated by spontaneous or enzymatic loss of a nucleic acid base. The second lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) is an atypical abasic site appearing as a result of inherent instability of the 3&#x02032;-phosphodiester bond in abasic deoxyribose in lesion 1 or its cleavage by a Class I AP endonuclease. As shown by the arrow, AP endonucleases cleave the phosphodiester linkage at the abasic sites. In the novel Endo IV assay a short probe with a fluorophore linked through a phosphate at the 3&#x02032; end and a short enhancer oligonucleotide generate an artificial, lesion 2 type Endo IV substrate. This arrangement allows the specific and efficient cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of the probe by Endo IV and release of fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The addition of a quencher at the 5&#x02032; end of the probe allows quenching of the fluorescence in the uncleaved probe. The specific cleavage of the phosphate bond and the generation of fluorescence is the basis of the new assay.</p><p>In this study we used endonuclease IV from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Endo IV). The enzyme functions as a Class II AP endonuclease and as a 3&#x02032; terminal phosphodiesterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Endo IV is enzymatically similar to exonuclease III, the major AP endonuclease of <italic>E.coli</italic>, but it differs from the latter enzyme mainly in lacking the associated exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). It was also found that <italic>E.coli</italic> Endo IV is fairly heat stable to &#x0223c;70&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Full characterization for all the compounds described below can be found in the Supplementary Data.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleic acid templates</title><p>A total of 102 unrelated Centre Etude Polymorphism Humaine DNA samples were obtained from the Coriell Institute of Medical Research (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://locus.umdnj.edu/"/>) after specifying that the DNA samples should be used for research purpose only.

It was shown that Endo IV cleavage of the probe has a relatively flat pH optimum in the range between pH 8.5 and 9.5. For compatibility with post-PCR Endo IV amplification the assay buffer with pH 8.6 was chosen, similar to that of the PCR master mixture. Inclusion of the divalent magnesium cation in the buffer ranging from 0 to 20 mM, resulted in more than 2-fold increase in cleavage rate, the optimum range was &#x0223c;5&#x02013;8 mM. A concentration of 5 mM was chosen for the Endo IV assay. It was determined that the monovalent cations, such as Li, Na, K and Rb, inhibit Endo IV cleavage activity for the concentrations studied in the range from 0 to 100 mM. An inhibition of &#x0223c;30% was observed at 20 mM monovalent cation concentration, which increased to &#x0223c;60&#x02013;70% at 100 mM concentration. The optimum probe concentration was determined to be &#x0223c;600 nM, please see Supplementary Figures 1&#x02013;3.</p></sec><sec><title>Optimization of fluorophore and linker structures</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows a model Endo IV assay that requires a target complementary to an enhancer and a probe labeled at the 5&#x02032; end with an Eclipse Dark Quencher and a fluorescent dye at the 3&#x02032; end. As shown, the probe (calculated <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 46.7&#x000b0;C) and enhancer (calculated <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 50.2&#x000b0;C) are separated by one base to mimic a natural abasic site. Four probes with different fluorescent dyes and linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) were evaluated for their performance in the new assay. Fluorophores FL1, FL2 and FL3 of the probes I, II and III (with similar quantum yields) contained a hydroxyprolinol linker between the 3&#x02032;-phosphate of the probe sequence and the core of the dyes. Fluorophore FL4 of probe IV was analogous to FL3 of probe III, with an additional aminocaproic spacer introduced between the hydroxylprolinol moiety and the dye; the purpose of this spacer was to distance the fluorophore from the cleavage site.</p><p>The probe specificity was evaluated by comparing the cleavage rates in the presence and absence of target. Target-dependent (specific) and target-independent (non-specific) cleavage rates of the probe were measured as the percent target cleaved per minute. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Probes I&#x02013;III demonstrated similar specific cleavage. A 2- to 3-fold decrease in the rate of non-specific cleavage for probes II and III versus probe I was observed. These low, non-specific cleavage rates translate into high-specific to non-specific cleavage ratios. It appears that chloro- or chloro/methyl substitutions in the fluorophores of probes II and III, respectively, are beneficial for the reduction of non-specific cleavage. One possible explanation for this reduction may be an effect of increased hydrophobicity of FL2 and FL3 on enzyme activity. In the case of probe IV, with the extended hydroxyprolinol linker, the rate of specific cleavage almost doubled. However, the corresponding increase in the rate of non-specific cleavage was &#x0223c;20 times higher than that observed in probe III, substantially compromising the ratio of specific to non-specific cleavage rates. Once again, this result implies the existence of inhibiting interactions between Endo IV enzymatic activity and fluorophore which can be adjusted by moving the fluorophore away from the active center.</p><p>The rigid hydroxyprolinol linker with low non-specific cleavage rates utilized in probes I&#x02013;III was identified as the linker of choice in the Endo IV assays.</p><p>The use of a flexible, straight chain linker (C6) instead of hydroxyprolinol-based linker increased the rates of non-specific cleavage to even higher degree than the extended hydroxyprolinol linker and reduced the specific to non-specific ratios to an unacceptable level (data not shown).</p><p>It appears that both the structure of the sterically constrained hydroxyprolinol linker and proximity of the bulky dye moiety to the cleavage site moderate cleavability of the 3&#x02032;-terminal phosphodiester bond and practically eliminate non-template-dependent cleavage.</p></sec><sec><title>Enhancer optimization</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows the target, probe and the enhancer aligned with the target to indicate different gaps. The <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of the enhancer is typically chosen to be at least 5&#x000b0;C higher than that of the probe. The cleavage rates in the presence of enhancer are shown with 1&#x02013;5 base gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As expected, based on the natural abasic substrate requirement shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, a one base gap gave the highest cleavage rate. The probe in the absence of enhancer showed a cleavage rate nearly equivalent to that of a 4 base gap in the presence of enhancer. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the maximum cleavage rate is achieved at a concentration of enhancer greater than &#x0223c;80 nM. In practice, the concentration of the enhancer is typically at least equivalent or larger than that of the probe. Some cleavage is observed with no enhancer present.</p></sec><sec><title>Probe <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> optimization</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows how the cleavage rate of probes with different <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>s changes with temperature.

A relatively sharp cleavage rate optimum was observed for the probes a, b and c with calculated <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>s of 60, 48 and 42, respectively.

Performing the assay at a temperature slightly higher than the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) showed not only optimum activity but also appears to allow probe cleavage cycling, an important feature of this assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of assay sensitivity</title><p>The ability of the Endo IV assay to detect different target concentrations is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. It was observed that in the case of 125 nM target concentration, the probe-based fluorescence plateaued in &#x0223c;1 h, while in the presence of 25 nM target a fluorescence plateau was reached in &#x0223c;3 h. The limit of detection of this assay is 0.04 nM, clearly distinguishable from the stable background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This stable background, a characteristic feature of the assay, is maintained over a period of 15 h. This property is also observed in the assay with other nucleic acid targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Mismatch discrimination</title><p>The ability of the Endo IV assay to discriminate mismatches at different positions of a 14mer probe is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Mismatches were introduced in the probe one at a time, from positions 1 to 8. The Endo IV assay shows excellent specificity for the different mismatches from base 1 to base 6 with large match/mismatch signal ratios. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the mismatch signal is often about the same as that of the NTC or slightly higher. The exceptions are the difficult 4-G/T- and 8-T/G-mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) where match/mismatch ratios of &#x0223c;16 and 7 were observed, respectively. These ratios are quite adequate to differentiate matched and mismatched sequences. It appears (data not shown) that the discrimination in positions 1 and 2 is largely determined by substrate requirements while discrimination in other positions is determined by thermodynamic considerations. Experiments with a large number of assays have also indicated that, with 10mer to 12mer probes, satisfactory discrimination is observed with the mismatch position in all except the last three bases at the 5&#x02032; end.</p><p>The exquisite specificity of the Endo IV assay appears to be the result of at least two factors. The first is the strict intrinsic substrate specificity requirement of the Endo IV enzyme which appears to require the rigid prolinol linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 0) used in the probes I&#x02013;III. Second, the use of short probes (10mer to 12mer) gives the Endo IV a distinct advantage over most other assays where probes are typically much longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Post-PCR Endo IV genotyping</title><p>The application of the Endo IV cleavage as a post-PCR detection system is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>. Following an asymmetric PCR using primers to produce predominantly single-stranded amplicon, two allele-specific probes, an enhancer and Endo IV enzyme are added to the amplification mixture and incubated isothermally for about an hour. The cleaved fluorescence from the two allele-specific probes, each labeled with a different fluorescent dye, is then plotted in a scatter diagram as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> for the genotyping analysis of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which are of immediate importance to in cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov"/>). The scatter diagrams of two polymorphisms, namely agouti signal molecular epidemiology studies protein (ASIP-01) and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC-03) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov"/>) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, respectively. In both cases, a probe specific to the wild-type allele is labeled with FL1 and a probe specific for the mutant allele labeled with FL3 is used.</p><p>The probe sets, designed to analyze ASIP-01 and APC-03 polymorphisms, were used to assay 102 unrelated human DNA samples obtained from the Coriell Institute. In the case of the ASIP-01 target the mismatch was situated two bases from the 3&#x02032; end of the probe, while in the case of APC-03, the mismatch was six bases from the 3&#x02032; end of the probe.</p><p>From our experience, the spacing of the allele clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> are comparable or better than those scatter plots observed in other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). The exquisite specificity achieved with the Endo IV enzyme, combined with the shorter probes used and the high signal accumulation, gives this assay an advantage over other SNP assays. In comparison with other signal accumulating assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), the Endo IV assay has similar levels of high signal accumulation, but uses shorter probes with higher specificity than those assays. In the case of hybridization-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), the Endo IV assay has not only a signal accumulation advantage, but also uses shorter probes with a specificity advantage. In addition, the shorter probes allow much more flexibility in assay design compared to other methods with longer probes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>We disclosed a novel nucleic acid signal detection system based on the cleavage of a phosphodiester linkage in a dual-dye-labeled oligonucleotide probe by the Endo IV enzyme from <italic>E.coli</italic>. The parameters influencing the activity of the Endo IV enzyme were optimized. This optimized Endo IV detection assay requires, in addition to an oligonucleotide probe substrate, a fluorophore attached through a relatively rigid linker to the oligonucleotide and a helper oligonucleotide. The rigid linker conveys the exquisite specificity of Endo IV cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage in the probe and shows high-specific/non-specific rate ratios. The synthesis of fluorophore analogs coupled to a rigid linker and solid support, used in the synthesis of labeled oligonucleotides, was also disclosed. Excellent mismatch discrimination is observed from positions 1 to 6 in a 12mer probe. The ability to put the mismatch in any one of positions 1&#x02013;6, allows for flexibility in probe design for genotyping assays where sequence and secondary structural constraints are considered. This method allows the use of probes shorter than those typically used in other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) contributing to the improved mismatch discrimination.</p><p>The combination of the Endo IV assay with a PCR as a post-amplification detection system has been demonstrated. Post-PCR Endo IV genotyping shows excellent spacing of scatter plot endpoint signals of no template controls, wild-type, mutant and heterozygous samples allowing clear allele differentiation. In contrast, other endpoint genotyping methods may suffer from overlapping endpoint signals due to PCR efficiency issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). This Endo IV post-PCR genotyping has been successfully used in an industry setting for &#x0003e;5000 genotype assays.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR online.</p></sec>

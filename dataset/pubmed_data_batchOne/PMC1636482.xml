Transcriptional regulation plays a key role in COX-2 expression in human colon carcinoma cells, but post-transcriptional regulation of its mRNA is also critical for tumorigenesis. Expression of COX-2 mRNA is regulated by various cytokines, growth factors and other signals. &#x003b2;-Catenin, a key transcription factor in the Wnt signal pathway, activates transcription of COX-2. Here we found that COX-2 mRNA was also substantially stabilized by activating &#x003b2;-catenin in NIH3T3 and 293T cells. We identified the &#x003b2;-catenin-responsive element in the proximal region of the COX-2 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) and showed that &#x003b2;-catenin interacted with AU-rich elements (ARE) of 3&#x02032;-UTR <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, &#x003b2;-catenin induced the cytoplasmic localization of the RNA stabilizing factor, HuR, which may bind to &#x003b2;-catenin in an RNA-mediated complex and facilitate &#x003b2;-catenin-dependent stabilization of COX-2 mRNA. Taken together, we provided evidences for &#x003b2;-catenin as an RNA-binding factor and a regulator of stabilization of COX-2 mRNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Precise regulation of gene expression is important for normal cell functions; hence various steps of transcription and post-transcription may be coupled to coordinately express target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). For example, activation of transcription and stabilization of mRNA may have similar impacts on upregulating specific target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). These effects can be mediated by DNA&#x02013;protein interactions on regulatory regions, and RNA&#x02013;protein interactions on the UTRs of mRNAs. There are examples of dual-specificity nucleic acid binding proteins that are important to transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p>&#x003b2;-Catenin is a multifunctional protein that interacts with many proteins, including the sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor TCF and other proteins implicated in transcription and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Such promiscuous interactions suggest that &#x003b2;-catenin may be involved in diverse cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). For example, it was originally identified as a cell adhesion protein but later recognized as a key transcriptional regulator of Wnt signaling. However, it is not clear at this point whether &#x003b2;-catenin is also involved in other cellular functions. One way of finding such novel functions is to identify new interaction partners for &#x003b2;-catenin.</p><p>The signal transduction pathway leading to &#x003b2;-catenin activation is as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The scaffolding proteins adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Axin/Axin2 interact with &#x003b2;-catenin, and glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; (GSK-3&#x003b2;) subsequently phosphorylates &#x003b2;-catenin, which mediates ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). As &#x003b2;-catenin levels rise, it accumulates in the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of various oncogenic target genes such as cyclin D1, c-myc and MMP-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Significantly, mutations of &#x003b2;-catenin in cancer cells are associated with defects in proteosomal degradation, and the accumulated &#x003b2;-catenin is localized in the nucleus, especially in colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Therefore, since the nuclear functions of &#x003b2;-catenin may be critical, finding novel interactions could provide a clue to how it contributes to tumorigenesis.</p><p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). It participates in the colorectal caricinogenesis pathway, in which mutation of APC tends to be the initial event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Transcription of COX-2 is induced by the Wnt and Ras signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). However, mRNA stabilization is thought to be the major mechanism up-regulating COX-2 expression in colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). AU-rich elements (ARE) in the proximal region of the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) of COX-2 are responsible for rapid decay of the mRNA and are recognized by a multimeric protein complex containing HuR and other RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). ARE binding proteins recruit exosome to degrade mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Altered expression of the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR is believed to be critical for promoting COX-2 expression in colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>Here we report an unexpected mechanism by which &#x003b2;-catenin controls COX-2 gene expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. COX-2 is a &#x003b2;-catenin target gene that is transcriptionally activated by Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). We show here that activated &#x003b2;-catenin stabilizes COX-2 mRNA and binds to ARE in its 3&#x02032;-UTR. Stabilization of COX-2 mRNA is likely to be mediated by the interaction between &#x003b2;-catenin and HuR. Since increasing mRNA stability has the same effect as upregulating transcription, we suggest that &#x003b2;-catenin-induced mRNA stabilization could also potentiate the oncogenic effect of &#x003b2;-catenin in cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and reagents</title><p>The retroviral vector expressing human S37A &#x003b2;-catenin was kindly provided by Dr Jang-Soo Chun (Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology). Bacterial expression vectors for recombinant &#x003b2;-catenin and HuR proteins were obtained from Dr Tsutomu Nakamura (University of Tokyo) and Dr Yoshikuni Nagamine (Friedrich Miescher Institute), respectively. The bacterial expression vector for Arm 1-12 was constructed by inserting the armadillo repeat sequence into the BamHI&#x02013;XhoI sites of the vector pGEX-5X (Pharmacia). The reporter plasmids for the transcriptional pulse assays, designated pBBB<sup>&#x00394;UTR</sup> and pBBB<sup>COX-2 UTR</sup>, were a gift of Dr Jiahuai Han (Scripps Research Institute). Luciferase reporters containing COX-2 UTR were kindly donated by Dr Stephen M. Prescott (University of Utah) and have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The luciferase reporter for F1 AS was generated by subcloning the F1 fragment into pGL3 vector using the XbaI site. Anti-HuR monoclonal (3A2) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz, and the anti-&#x003b2;-catenin monoclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories.

An aliquot of 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g of the DNAse I-treated RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript II Reverse transcriptase (Stratagene).

Subsequently, unbound RNA was digested for 15 min with 10 U of RNase T1 (Ambion) at 37&#x000b0;C. RNA&#x02013;protein complexes were resolved on 6% native polyacrylamide gels. For supershift assays, 1 &#x003bc;g of antibody was incubated with each binding reaction for 30 min on ice before the complexes were resolved by electrophoresis. To test whether &#x003b2;-catenin binds directly to the UTR, the labeled RNA was incubated with GST-fusion proteins and assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation assays</title><p>To confirm the RNA&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin complex, NIH3T3 or HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with the various luciferase reporter plasmids, and incubated with 1% formaldehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Sonicated lysates were immunoprecipitated with either normal IgG, or anti-&#x003b2;-catenin antibody.

Bound proteins were examined by western blotting.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>&#x003b2;-catenin is required for stabilization of COX-2 mRNA</title><p>There is much evidence that COX-2 mRNA is regulated by Wnt signaling and &#x003b2;-catenin overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). However, there is as yet no direct evidence that COX-2 mRNA expression is regulated by &#x003b2;-catenin at the post-transcriptional level. To see whether activated &#x003b2;-catenin affects COX-2 mRNA stability, we used a transcriptional pulsing system that allowed the determination of mRNA decay kinetics without the complication of adding transcriptional inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The pBBB<sup>COX-2 UTR</sup> plasmid, encoding &#x003b2;-globin mRNA bearing the COX-2 mRNA 3&#x02032;-UTR, was cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with a plasmid expressing S37A &#x003b2;-catenin, a stabilized form of &#x003b2;-catenin, or with the empty vector as a control. The &#x003b2;-globin mRNA was transiently transcribed after serum induction of growth-arrested NIH3T3, and its level was measured by real-time PCR. A plasmid encoding luciferase mRNA was included to serve as internal standard. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, &#x003b2;-catenin expression increased the stability of the &#x003b2;-globin mRNA, which was relatively unstable in the control vector-transfected cells. In contrast, &#x003b2;-catenin had little effect on the stability of the &#x003b2;-globin mRNA lacking the COX-2 mRNA 3&#x02032;-UTR (pBBB<sup>&#x00394;UTR</sup>).</p><p>We next tested whether the accumulation of endogenous &#x003b2;-catenin leads to stabilize pBBB<sup>COX-2 UTR</sup> transcripts. Exposure to LiCl, a GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitor, or MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, increased cellular &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and pBBB<sup>COX-2 UTR</sup> transcripts were indeed stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To investigate whether &#x003b2;-catenin regulates the stability of endogenous COX-2 mRNA, 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing S37A &#x003b2;-catenin or treated with LiCl. Transcription was stopped by actinomycin D, and the stability of COX-2 mRNA was analyzed by RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that both the expression of &#x003b2;-catenin and LiCl treatment drastically increased the half-life of endogenous COX-2 mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>The proximal region of the 3&#x02032;-UTR is critical for &#x003b2;-catenin-induced COX-2 mRNA stabilization</title><p>To map the regions of the COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR responsible for stabilization we utilized luciferase reporters containing the full-length COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR or various deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). LiCl treatment has no significant effect on luciferase activity in cells transfected with either the luciferase control (&#x00394;UTR) or luciferase lacking the F1 region of the COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR (&#x00394;F1). In contrast, it increased the luciferase activities derived from the full-length COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR (Full) or the F1 region (F1), suggesting that the F1 region is responsible for the &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated stabilization of COX-2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>There are multiple copies of the AU-rich sequence element (ARE) in the 1455 nt 3&#x02032;-UTR of COX-2 mRNA. To identify the <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences modulated by &#x003b2;-catenin, we examined a cell-free mRNA decay system that has proven useful in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). We synthesized RNA substrates comprising three distinct regions of the COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR (F1, F2 and F3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Subsequently, the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNA substrates were incubated with cytoplasmic extracts from either vector-transfected or &#x003b2;-catenin-transfected NIH3T3 cell, and their degradation was measured using denaturing polyacrylamide gels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the F2 and F3 mRNA substrates, which do not contain the ARE region, were as stable as the GAPDH mRNA, and were not affected by &#x003b2;-catenin. On the other hand, the F1 mRNA which had a relatively short half-life was stabilized by cytoplasmic extracts containing overexpressed &#x003b2;-catenin. Stabilization of the COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR by &#x003b2;-catenin was confirmed using MG132- or LiCl-treated cytoplasmic extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). These results show that the proximal region of the 3&#x02032;-UTR is critical for &#x003b2;-catenin-induced COX-2 mRNA stabilization.</p></sec><sec><title>The class I AREs in proximal COX-2 UTR are the &#x003b2;-catenin-responsive element</title><p>Since the F1 region of the COX-2 UTR contains multiple copies of ARE, we dissected the F1 sequence. AREs are classified into three groups according to features of their sequence and their RNA decay characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The F1 region of the COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR contains both class I ARE with one to three scattered copies of the AUUUA motif and class II ARE with multiple overlapping copies of that motif. To further define the &#x003b2;-catenin-responsive sequences in the F1 region, we further divided the 145 nt of F1 into 40 nt fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and evaluated their degradation rates. We found that both the F1-1 (class II) and F1-2 (class I) fragments were unstable, whereas the F1-3 (non-ARE) fragment was as stable as the control GAPDH mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We next tested which RNA substrates responded to &#x003b2;-catenin-induced stabilization. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, strong expression of &#x003b2;-catenin stabilized F1-2 rather than F1-1. Furthermore, mutation of the UUU residues of AUUUA to CGC in F1-2 (F1-2 MT) completely abolished the ARE-induced instability. These <italic>in vitro</italic> decay data indicate that &#x003b2;-catenin is responsible for stabilization of the class I ARE region of the F1 UTR.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;-Catenin binds to the F1 region of COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR</title><p>To stabilize COX-2 mRNA &#x003b2;-catenin could either directly interact with the ARE of COX-2 or indirectly affect other signaling proteins. To determine whether &#x003b2;-catenin binds to the COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR, RNA-EMSAs were performed with recombinant &#x003b2;-catenin and radiolabeled RNA probes. The &#x003b2;-catenin protein was able to complex labeled F1 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but did not interact with labeled F2 or F3 RNA (data not shown). The specificity of the RNA binding was also confirmed by competition with excess unlabeled F1 or non-specific NC RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). To characterize the binding specificity of &#x003b2;-catenin to COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR, other recombinant proteins were incubated with labeled F1 RNA. The armadillo repeats (Arm 1-12) of &#x003b2;-catenin as well as the ARE-binding HuR protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) formed RNA&#x02013;protein complexes, but the other proteins did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). RNA-EMSAs also showed that the binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of Arm 1-12 for F1 RNA was &#x0223c;25 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, the specificity of the RNA binding was confirmed by competition with excess unlabeled F1 or a &#x003b2;-catenin-specific RNA aptamer (H. K. Lee <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript submitted). Moreover, we found that &#x003b2;-catenin bound to the minimal &#x003b2;-catenin-responsive element, F1-2, but not to mutant F1-2 (data not shown). We conclude that &#x003b2;-catenin associates directly with ARE located in the first 150 nt of the COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR.</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular interaction of &#x003b2;-catenin with F1 RNA</title><p>Since we observed that &#x003b2;-catenin bound to COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR with high affinity <italic>in vitro</italic>, we tested for the interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> by RNA immunoprecipitation assays. LiCl-treated NIH3T3 cells were transfected with various luciferase reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and Antisense of F1, F1AS) and fixed with formaldehyde. Subsequently lysates were immunoprecipitated with either &#x003b2;-catenin or normal IgG, and bound RNA was purified and analyzed by RT&#x02013;PCR. Only the luciferase mRNA with full-size and F1 UTR were found in the anti-&#x003b2;-catenin immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We obtained similar results in &#x003b2;-catenin-overexpressing HCT116 colon cancer cells (data not shown), showing that the F1 region in the proximal COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR is sufficient for interaction with cellular &#x003b2;-catenin.</p><p>We also carried out supershift assays with cytoplasmic extracts prepared from vector- or &#x003b2;-catenin-expressing NIH3T3 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that RNA&#x02013;protein complexes were readily detected with both of these cytoplasmic extracts. Control IgG had no effect on the migration of RNA&#x02013;protein complex whereas a prominent slowly migrating band was detected with anti-HuR antibody, and the intensity of this supershifted band was stronger when a &#x003b2;-catenin-overexpressing cytoplasmic extract was used. Moreover, a supershifted band was also observed when we used anti-&#x003b2;-catenin antibody, demonstrating that &#x003b2;-catenin was present in this RNA&#x02013;protein complex. Since overexpression of &#x003b2;-catenin promoted the interaction of HuR with F1 RNA but did not alter the level of HuR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we tested whether HuR localization was affected by overexpressing &#x003b2;-catenin and found that it caused HuR to move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data indicate that overexpressed &#x003b2;-catenin associates with the COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR and induces HuR to translocate to the cytoplasm where it acts to stabilize COX-2 mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA-dependent interaction of &#x003b2;-catenin and HuR</title><p>Since both recombinant &#x003b2;-catenin and HuR proteins bound to the F1 region of the COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we reasoned that &#x003b2;-catenin and HuR might interact <italic>in vivo</italic> and this interaction could be related to their binding to COX-2 3&#x02032;-UTR. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the cellular locations of &#x003b2;-catenin and HuR in HT-29 colon cancer cells. Both &#x003b2;-catenin and HuR were mostly located in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Next, the interaction of &#x003b2;-catenin and HuR was examined by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments with different subcellular fractions from HT-29 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, co-IP with anti-&#x003b2;-catenin as well as anti-HuR precipitated large amounts of HuR and &#x003b2;-catenin proteins from the cytoplasmic extract, while these interactions were not readily detectable in nuclear extracts.</p><p>We next tested whether the interaction between HuR and &#x003b2;-catenin was mediated by RNA. It has been reported that HuR binds to AUF1 in an RNA-dependent complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). When we performed IP experiment in the presence of heparin or RNases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) we observed specific disruption of the protein&#x02013;protein interaction between HuR and &#x003b2;-catenin by the RNases but not by heparin. These results lead us to believe that the interaction between &#x003b2;-catenin and HuR occurs in a cytoplasmic RNA&#x02013;protein complex that includes COX-2 mRNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here we report novel function of &#x003b2;-catenin in the regulation of mRNA stability by direct interaction to mRNA. We have shown above that the transcriptional activator &#x003b2;-catenin binds to the COX-2 UTR and inhibits COX-2 mRNA degradation. Even though &#x003b2;-catenin is known to bind to many different proteins, this is, as far as we know, the first report of its direct binding to nucleic acids. The RNA&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin interaction has many implications for nucleic acid metabolism. Since RNA binding proteins are important in various aspects of post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), &#x003b2;-catenin may regulate gene expression in various ways, including affecting mRNA stability as shown here.</p><p>The functional significance of &#x003b2;-catenin in carcinogenesis is not necessarily restricted to transcriptional activation of target gene expression. Stabilization of unstable mRNA by &#x003b2;-catenin could also have significant impact on the expression of target mRNAs in cancer cells. It was shown here that one of the crucial mRNAs, COX-2, was stabilized by S37A &#x003b2;-catenin in NIH3T3 and 293T cells. In fact, it has been suggested previously that &#x003b2;-catenin might directly or indirectly regulate mRNA stability. For example, recent reports showed that Pitx2, &#x003b2;-TrCP, c-myc and other unstable mRNAs are stabilized by the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway and VEGF-D mRNA was destabilized by &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Significantly, we have now added COX-2 to the list of mRNAs stabilized by &#x003b2;-catenin.</p><p>Our results suggest multiple effects of &#x003b2;-catenin on <italic>COX-2</italic> gene expression. Since transcription and post-transcriptional processes are coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), &#x003b2;-catenin may also be participate in other steps of gene expression. For example, it is possible that it modulates RNA splicing, and RNA export or translation in addition to mRNA stability. In fact, it was previously shown that &#x003b2;-catenin interacts with the FUS/TLS splicing regulator protein and act as a splicing regulator for estrogen receptor-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Furthermore, since &#x003b2;-catenin regulates many transcripts, such post-transcriptional regulation could affect other mRNAs and provide new insights into the coordinated regulation of multiple target genes by a protein.</p><p>We showed that &#x003b2;-catenin binds to the AU-rich RNA sequences of the COX-2 UTR, and also interacts with the RNA binding protein HuR via RNA-mediated interactions. HuR regulates the turnover of many mRNAs. Since it binds to many oncogenic transcripts, altered expression of HuR may be an important factor in colon carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). For example, HuR binds to many mRNAs and regulates cyclin A and cyclin B1 mRNA stabilization during proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). However the detailed mechanism of &#x003b2;-catenin- and HuR-mediated stabilization of COX-2 mRNA remains to be clarified. We showed here that &#x003b2;-catenin may coordinate transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation as part of a ribonucleoprotein complex. It points to the possible existence of a specific regulatory pathway that conveys a signal affecting both transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes of target genes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The generous gifts of various DNA constructs from Drs Nakamura, Nagamine, Chun, Prescott and Han are greatly appreciated.

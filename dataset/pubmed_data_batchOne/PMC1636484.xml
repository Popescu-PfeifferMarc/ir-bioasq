The motor contains six pRNAs, an enzyme and one 12-subunit connector with a central channel for DNA transportation. A 20-residue peptide containing a His-tag was fused to the N-terminus of the connector protein gp10. This fusion neither interfered with procapsid assembly nor affected the morphology of the prolate-shaped procapsid. However, the pRNA binding and virion assembly activity were greatly reduced. Such decreased functions can be switched back on by the removal of the tag via protease cleavage, supporting the previous finding that the N-terminus of gp10 is essential for the pRNA binding. The DNA-packaging efficiency with dimeric pRNA was more seriously affected by the extension than with monomeric pRNA. It is speculated that the fusion of the tag generated physical hindrance to pRNA binding, with greater influence for the dimers than the monomers due to their size. These results reveal a potential to turn off and turn on the motor by attaching or removing, respectively, a component to outer part of the motor, and offers an approach for the inhibition of viral replication by using a drug or a small peptide targeted to motor components.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The viral DNA-packaging motor of dsDNA bacteriophage (e.g. phi29, lambda, T4 and T7) can translocate and compress genomic DNA with tremendous velocity into a preformed protein shell, called the procapsid, fueled by hydrolysis of ATP during assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The procapsid of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> bacteriophage phi29 consists of the major capsid protein gp8 (235 copies), connector protein gp10 (12 copies), head fiber protein gp8.5 (55 copies) and the scaffolding protein gp7 (180 copies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Investigation of the bacterial virus phi29 DNA-packaging motor revealed a molecule known as pRNA (packaging RNA) that plays an essential role in packaging DNA into procapsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The pRNA contains two functional domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). One domain, composed of the central region of the pRNA, binds to the procapsid. The other domain, which functions as a DNA translocation domain, is located at the 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; paired ends. Six copies of pRNA have been hypothesized to form a hexameric ring via monomer to dimer and then hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) to drive the DNA-packaging motor.</p><p>One of the essential components of the phi29 DNA-packaging motor is the connector complex, which shows a dodecameric cylindrical structure with a 3.6 nm central channel through which viral genomic DNA is packaged into or exits the procapsid during the viral life cycle. The detailed structure of the phi29 portal connector protein gp10 has been solved at the atomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The phi29 connector ring consists of alpha-helical subunits, and three long helices of each subunit form an inner channel. The wider end of the connector is kept inside the procapsid, while the narrow end partially protrudes from the procapsid. Based upon the structure, it is evident that the N-terminus protrudes from the narrow end of the connector and the C-terminus extends from the wider end of the connector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">16&#x02013;20</xref>); therefore, the C-terminus is hidden within the procapsid and the N-terminus is exposed to the solvent.</p><p>Recent DNA-packaging models proposed that the 5-fold procapsid vertex and 12-fold connector (or the hexameric pRNA ring) could constitute a mechanical motor in which the relative motion of the two rings could produce a force to drive the phi29 rotation motor to pack DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Although the published DNA-packaging models all agree that pRNA bound to one component to execute a consecutive rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), there were discrepancies regarding the foothold for the pRNA. The recently published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) suggest that the foothold for pRNA binding is the connector, specifically, the N-terminus. Six copies of pRNA are bound to the connector and work sequentially, so that the pRNA&#x02013;connector complex is part of the rotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that an additional 20 amino acids fused to the N-terminus of gp10 did not morphologically affect procapsid assembly but blocked the binding of pRNA to the His-procapsid. However, such diminished function can be switched &#x02018;on&#x02019; by the removal of the 20 amino acids via proteolytic cleavage with Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease. These results reveal a potential to turn on and off the motor by attaching a component to the N-terminus of the connector, and offers an approach for the inhibition of viral replication using a drug or a small peptide targeted to motor components for specific blockage of DNA-packaging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of plasmid pHis-gp7-8-8.5-10 for the production of recombinant His-procapsid</title><p>Plasmid pHis-gp7-8-8.5-10 was constructed from two plasmids, pET-His-gp10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and pARgp7-8-8.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).

These proteins self-assembled into His-procapsid. After purification, the His-tagged procapsid was analyzed with SDS&#x02013;PAGE, revealing that all the procapsid structural components gp7, gp8, gp8.5 and gp10 of the His-procapsid were present with a similar ratio as compared to wild-type phi29 procapsid. The molecular weight of gp7, gp8 and gp8.5 were identical to the corresponding proteins in wild-type procapsid, while His-gp10 showed higher molecular weight than wild-type gp10 due to the 20 additional amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). His-procapsid, His-procapsid cleaved by TEV and wild-type procapsid were examined by negative stain electron microscopy. Results showed that there were no significant changes in the structure among them; all showed the typical prolate-shape of phi29 procapsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that the His-procapsid possesses the same morphology as procapsid assembled from untagged gp10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Proteolytic treatment of His-procapsid generated wild-type procapsid</title><p>In the procapsid, the C-terminus of gp10 is located at the wider end of the connector that is buried within the procapsid, while the N-terminus is located at the narrow end of the connector that is exposed to the solvent. Protease TEV is expected to cleave the His-tag that is fused with the TEV recognition site proximal to the N-terminus of gp10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Treatment of His-procapsid with TEV resulted in the removal of His-tag, producing a gp10 with molecular weight similar to the gp10 from wild-type procapsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein profile of His-procapsid after TEV digestion confirmed the cleavage of His-gp10 into wild-type gp10, while no changes were observed for the major capsid protein gp8, the fiber protein gp8.5 and the scaffolding protein gp7 of the procapsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The results indicate that TEV cleaved His-procapsid produced a procapsid with a normal connector protein gp10 without affecting other capsid proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>The activities for pRNA binding, DNA-packaging and virion assembly of His-procapsid were decreased for His-procapsid compared to wild-type procapsid</title><p>The inhibition by the His-procapsid in pRNA binding was clearly shown by sucrose gradient sedimentation. The purified His-procapsid was incubated with [<sup>3</sup>H]pRNA and then subjected to 5&#x02013;20% sucrose gradient sedimentation. Results showed that the binding of pRNA to His-procapsid was almost undetectable. No radioactive peak for His-procapsid&#x02013;pRNA complex could be found, while a peak representing the normal procapsid&#x02013;pRNA complex appeared and was centered near fraction 22 when procapsid was mixed with [<sup>3</sup>H]pRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>An <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA-packaging system was used to test whether the His-procapsid is functional in DNA translocation.

The DNA-packaging activity of pRNA A-a&#x02032;, E-e&#x02032; and (A-b&#x02032;) (B-a&#x02032;) which exists almost as pure dimer in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 5 and 8), displayed greater influence for His-procapsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 4, 5, 12 and 16), in comparison to pRNA I-i&#x02032;, or <italic>Sph</italic> I I-i&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3), which exist as a partial monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 3 and 4) before assembly into procapsid. Physically the pRNA dimer is longer than pRNA monomer. The longer the polymer, the more it would be affected by the barricade spatially and physically. We speculate that such decrease in packaging activity may be due to the dramatically decreased binding efficiency between pRNA and the connector. The physical hindrance by pRNA size is greater for dimers than monomers, while the binding to the connector was blocked by the extended tag. This hindrance was removed and activity was restored after TEV cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 8, 9, 13 and 17). Coinciding with DNA-packaging efficiency, His-procapsid also showed higher assembly activity when the partially monomeric pRNA I-i&#x02032; or <italic>Sph</italic> I I-i&#x02032; were used in the phi29 assembly system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, almost identical virion assembly activity of pRNA dimers and monomers were observed after the removal of His-tag from His-procapsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The pRNA is essential to DNA-packaging by the His-procapsid</title><p>As noted, the DNA-packaging activity of the His-procapsid was not affected by the His-tag insertion as seriously as pRNA binding. The decrease in pRNA binding to His-procapsid did not show direct correlation with inhibition of phage assembly. This would raise a question of whether the His-tagged procapsid requires the pRNA for DNA-packaging. Further testing from the RNase digestion of the purified procapsid/pRNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) reveals that virion assembly was significantly blocked after RNase digestion. This is an indication that the pRNA is still required for the DNA-packaging into the His-tagged procapsid.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>It was found that fusion of 20 amino acids to the N-terminus of each subunit of the connector protein gp10 did not interfere with procapsid assembly and did not affect the morphology of the prolate-shape procapsid, but the binding of pRNA to the His-procapsid was dramatically decreased and the assembly of phi29 virion was inhibited. However, such decreased activity in pRNA binding and DNA-packaging were restored via proteolytic cleavage with TEV. This result implied that the amino acid residues or carried charges at the N-terminus of the connector are critical for pRNA binding, this is in agreement with the recent finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), which showed that the removal of the N-terminal 14 amino acids of the gp10 protein by proteolytic cleavage resulted in undetectable binding of pRNA to either the connector or the procapsid.</p><p>It was also shown that pRNA dimers suffer more seriously from gp10 N-terminal extension than pRNA monomers in DNA-packaging. The DNA-packaging activity of pRNA dimer A-a&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) showed greater influence in comparison to the partial monomer I-i&#x02032;, or <italic>Sph</italic> I I-i&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) for His-procapsid. We propose that such a decrease in DNA-packaging activity for His-procapsid compared to wild-type is due to the physical barrier effect of an extended tag from the connector, which blocked the binding of pRNA to the N-terminus of the connector and generated greater hindrance for pRNA dimers than monomers due to the size.</p><p>As noted, the insertion of a His-tag to the N-terminal of gp10 significantly interfered with the binding of pRNA to procapsid, resulting in almost undetectable binding of pRNA to procapsid by sucrose gradient sedimentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, the DNA-packaging activity of the His-procapsid was not affected by the N-terminal extensions as seriously as pRNA binding. It is possible that the binding of pRNA to the connector was less stable because of the physical hindrance of an additional His-tag from the connector. The binding was actually happening during the DNA-packaging process when the motor was turning with the supply of ATP as the energy source. However, when the motor was not in the active mode, the complex of pRNA/His-procapsid was much less stable than the pRNA/procapsid complex that it may dissociate during the sucrose gradient. The question of if the His-tagged procapsid requires the pRNA for DNA packaging was answered by further testing with RNase digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and the results showed that the pRNA is still required for DNA-packaging of the His-tagged procapsid. The other possible explanation for disproportion between pRNA binding and DNA-packaging is that the DNA-packaging activity was enhanced by the His-tag insertion as long as pRNA binding occurred, a conclusion deduced by the inhibition rate of pRNA binding and DNA-packaging using the His-tagged procapsid. This conclusion is not contradictory to the finding that phi29 assembly was inhibited by the N-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The connector is the junction between procapsid and the tail. It makes sense that additional amino acids at the outer edge of the connector could affect the assembly of the tail and subsequently block the assembly of infectious virions.</p><p>The assembly of phi29 virion was inhibited by the N-terminal extension of 20 amino acids, suggesting that factors involved in virion assembly can be targets for specific antiviral treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). For example, a chemical or peptide targeting the motor components might block viral DNA-packaging. Bacteriophage phi29 of <italic>B.subtilis</italic> is a linear dsDNA virus for which the DNA-packaging process has been studied in great detail. The commonality in DNA-packaging among the linear dsDNA viruses, including dsDNA bacteriophages, adenoviruses, poxviruses, and herpes viruses, implies a unique strategy of this approach for a novel drug design, wherein the attachment of a small chemical or peptide to the motor would result in specific blockage of DNA-packaging. This principle also implies a strategy for gene therapy to viral infection by expressing an extended subunit of components of the viral DNA-packaging motor. RNA viruses might use the motor to package their genomic RNA as well (31,32).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Fusion of 20 amino acids to the N-terminus of each subunit of the connector did not interfere with procapsid assembly and did not affect the morphology of the prolate-shaped procapsid, but dramatically affected the binding of pRNA to the His-procapsid and the assembly of infectious virion.

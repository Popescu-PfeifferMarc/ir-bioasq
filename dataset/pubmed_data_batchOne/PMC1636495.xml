These ribozymes have the longest helices I reported in natural hammerheads, with that of the ELVd (+) hammerhead being particularly stable (5/7 bp are G-C). Moreover, the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site of this hammerhead is AUA, which together with GUA also found in some natural hammerheads, deviate from the GUC present in most natural hammerheads including the ELVd (&#x02212;) hammerhead. When the AUA trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site of the ELVd (+) hammerhead was substituted by GUA and GUC, as well as by AUC (essentially absent in natural hammerheads), the values of the self-cleavage rate constants at low magnesium of the purified hammerheads were: ELVd-(+)-AUC&#x02248;ELVd-(+)-GUC&#x0003e;ELVd-(+)-GUA&#x0003e; ELVd-(+)-AUA. However, the ELVd-(+)-AUC hammerhead was the catalytically less efficient during <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, most likely because of the transient adoption of catalytically-inactive metastable structures. These results suggest that natural hammerheads have been evolutionary selected to function co-transcriptionally, and provide a model explaining the lack of trinucleotide AUC preceding the self-cleavage site of most natural hammerheads. Comparisons with other natural hammerheads showed that the ELVd-(+)-GUC and ELVd-(+)-AUC hammerheads are the catalytically most active in a post-transcriptional context with low magnesium.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hammerhead ribozymes were initially described in viroid and viroid-like satellite RNAs wherein they mediate self-cleavage of the multimeric RNA intermediates of one or both polarities resulting from replication through a rolling-circle mechanism [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), for a review see Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)]. More specifically, hammerhead viroids follow a symmetric pathway of this mechanism in which the multimeric RNAs of both polarities self-cleave and subsequently are ligated into the corresponding monomeric circular RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Early structural dissection showed that minimized catalytically-active hammerheads have as few as 52 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), igniting much interest in deciphering the catalytic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and developing its potential as a biotechnological tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Most natural hammerheads are formed by a central conserved core flanked by three double-stranded regions with relaxed sequence requirements (helices I, II and III), two of which (I and II) are capped by short loops (1 and 2, respectively). X-ray crystallography uncovered an intricate assortment of non-canonical interactions between the nucleotides of the central core, explaining their conservation in natural hammerheads and illustrating that the actual contour does not resemble a hammerhead but rather a distorted Y in which the basal helix III is almost co-linear with helix II, whilst helix I forms an angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>However, these structural studies, which were performed with artificial hammerheads, are partially at odds with some biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), and the use of artificial ribozymes designed to act in <italic>trans</italic> against specific RNA targets have met with limited success <italic>in vivo</italic>. More recent data have provided an explanation for these discrepancies by showing that modifications of loops 1 and 2 of natural hammerheads provoke a drastic reduction in their catalytic activity, indicating that these peripheral regions play a crucial role in catalysis through tertiary interactions between some of their nucleotides that may favor the active site at the low magnesium concentration existing <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). These interactions, direct evidence for which has been recently derived from the crystallographic structure of a natural hammerhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), are currently being incorporated into a new generation of more efficient <italic>trans-</italic>acting artificial hammerheads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>Eggplant latent viroid (ELVd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) is the last reported member of the family <italic>Avsunviroidae</italic> of hammerhead viroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Both (+) and (&#x02212;) ELVd hammerheads display some peculiarities, the influence of which in the catalytic behavior of these ribozymes has not yet been determined. Here we report the effects of changes in the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site on the self-cleavage kinetics of the ELVd hammerheads, together with a model explaining the lack of trinucleotide AUC in most natural hammerheads, based on differences in co- and post-transcriptional self-cleavage. We also present a comparative analysis of the ELVd hammerheads with other natural hammerheads in a post-transcriptional context at low magnesium concentrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of hammerhead cDNAs</title><p>The cDNA of the ELVd (+) hammerhead was PCR-amplified with <italic>Pwo</italic> DNA polymerase and the buffer recommended by the supplier (Roche Diagnostics) using as template the plasmid containing the complete cDNA of the ELVd reference variant (ELVd-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) and the sense RF-689 (5&#x02032;-<underline>TAATACGACTCACTATAGG</underline>CCCCATAGGGTGGTGTG-3&#x02032;) and antisense RF-690 (5&#x02032;-<italic>TCTAGA</italic>CCCCATTTCGACC-3&#x02032;) primers.

After an initial denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 2 min, the PCR profile (30 cycles) was: 94&#x000b0;C for 20 s, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. The cDNA of the (+) hammerhead of the satellite RNA of tobacco ring spot virus (sTRSV) was prepared by extension of the partially overlapping sense RF-875 (5&#x02032;-GG<underline>TAATACGACTCACTATAGG</underline>CTGTCACCGGATGTGCTTTCCGGTC-3&#x02032;) and antisense RF-876 (5&#x02032;-GGG<italic>TCTAGA</italic>CTGTTTCGTCCTCACGGACTCATCAGACCGGAAAGC-3&#x02032;) primers (five cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 30&#x000b0;C for 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min). Sense primers included the T7 promoter (underlined) and antisense primers the XbaI site (in italics). Point mutations are indicated with lower case letters. PCR products were separated by PAGE in 10% gels and those with the expected length were eluted, digested with XbaI and cloned into pUC18 opened with XbaI and SmaI. Sequencing of the recombinant plasmids confirmed that they contained only the expected mutations.

Both (+) and (&#x02212;) ELVd strands contain the 11 residues that form the central conserved core of natural hammerheads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), flanked by helix I/loop 1 (7 bp and 4 nt), helix II/loop 2 (4 bp and 4 nt forming a stable loop of the GNRA family) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), and helix III (6 and 5 bp for + and &#x02212; hammerhead, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This morphology is similar to that of both hammerheads of PLMVd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), and to the (+) hammerheads of CChMVd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and sTRSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), although helices I of ELVd hammerheads are the longest reported in natural hammerheads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), with that of the (+) hammerhead being particularly stable (5/7 bp are G&#x02013;C). The sequence heterogeneity observed in natural ELVd variants is consistent with the existence in helix I of both ELVd hammerheads of a base pair between positions 1.7 and 2.7, because a U&#x02013;G pair is substituted by a U&#x02013;A pair or viceversa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). In the (+) ELVd hammerhead, positions 15.2 and 16.2 form a U&#x02013;A pair instead of the predominant C&#x02013;G pair, a situation also found in the (+) hammerhead of satellite RNA of cereal yellow dwarf virus RPV (sCYDV-RPV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and in the (&#x02212;) hammerhead of two cherry small circular RNAs (csc RNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). In these three hammerheads the residue preceding the self-cleavage site is A and not C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) as in most natural hammerheads, suggesting some relationship between the three positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The two ELVd hammerheads are more related to each other than to other hammerheads, as also occurs between the hammerheads of other viroid and viroid-like RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides against loops 1 and 2 efficiently prevent self-cleavage during <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of minimal natural hammerheads</title><p>Although the self-cleavage rates of artificial hammerheads can be estimated based on measurements from <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), most natural hammerheads self-cleave efficiently under standard <italic>in vitro</italic> transcriptions. This forces the adoption of non-standard conditions, particularly low pH and magnesium concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), which complicate further kinetic comparisons between different hammerheads. The alternative approach for estimating hammerhead self-cleavage rates, isolation of the uncleaved RNA from <italic>in vitro</italic> transcriptions and its subsequent incubation in a protein-free buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), suffers the limitation that the uncleaved primary transcript usually represents a minor fraction of the transcription products. Extensive self-cleavage of the hammerhead RNA during <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription can be avoided by incorporating an oligodeoxyribonucleotide complementary to part of the ribozyme. This approach has been previously used with one ribozyme of hepatitis delta virus RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), with <italic>in vitro</italic> selection of self-cleaving RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), with the CChMVd (+) and PLMVd (+) hammerheads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and with certain hammerheads encoded in the genome of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). In the CChMVd case, high levels of uncleaved primary transcripts (75% of the total RNA) were obtained in the presence of oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to the sequences forming part of helix I/loop 1 and helix II/loop 2 and the connecting CUGAUGA of the conserved central core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Preliminary experiments with the ELVd (+) hammerhead showed that self-cleavage proceeded extensively during <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription under standard conditions (data not shown). In an attempt to attenuate this problem, an antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide analogous to those used previously with the CChMVd (+) hammerhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) was incorporated to the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription mixture. However, the protecting effects were limited, as also were the effects of two other oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to sequences forming part of helix I/loop 1 and helix III connected by the A preceding the self-cleavage site, and to sequences forming part of helix II/loop 2 and helix III (data not shown). Considering that the fast self-cleavage rates of most natural hammerheads are very much influenced by tertiary interactions between loops 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), we designed two oligodeoxyribonucleotides, one complementary to the complete loop 1 and its adjacent sequences of helices I and II, and the other complementary to the complete loop 2 and its adjacent sequences of helices II and III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Co-incorporation of the two oligodeoxyribonucleotides to the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription mixture abolished essentially self-cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 3 with 2), providing further support for the proposed tertiary interactions between loops 1 and 2. Moreover, the same approach also worked for the PLMVd (+) and sTRSV (+) hammerheads (data not shown), thus indicating that it may be of general application. A possible explanation for these results is that loops 1 and 2 may be more easily accessible to antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide than regions more structured like the central conserved core or its flanking helices.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-cleavage kinetics of the ELVd (+) hammerhead and of three mutants affecting the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site</title><p>The trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site of most natural hammerheads, including the ELVd (&#x02212;) hammerhead, is GUC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). However, there are exceptions to this rule. As already indicated, the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site of the ELVd (+), sCYDV-RPV (+) and csc RNAs (&#x02212;) hammerheads is AUA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Furthermore, the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site of the (+) hammerhead of csc RNAs and the (&#x02212;) hammerhead of the satellite RNA of lucerne transient streak virus (sLTSV) is GUA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Because the effects on self-cleavage kinetics of interchanging these trinucleotides preceding the self-cleavage site have not been determined in a <italic>cis</italic> context and at low magnesium concentration, we examined this question in the ELVd (+) hammerhead. As a control, we also studied the effect of the trinucleotide AUC, which with one exception (see below), has never been found preceding the self-cleavage site of natural hammerheads.</p><p>At very low magnesium concentration (10 &#x003bc;M), the ELVd-(+)-GUC mutant (where the GUC refers to the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site) presented a self-cleavage rate constant significantly higher than the wild-type ELVd-(+)-AUA hammerhead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The ELVd-(+)-GUA mutant had a self-cleavage rate constant intermediate between those of the ELVd-(+)-GUC mutant and the ELVd-(+)-AUA wild-type but, surprisingly, the ELVd-(+)-AUC mutant displayed the highest rate constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, at the end-point of the reaction, 95% of molecules from the three mutants with the highest rate constants self-cleaved, whereas this fraction was only 60% for the wild-type ELVd-(+)-AUA hammerhead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A similar trend in the rate constants was observed when the magnesium concentration was increased moderately (50 &#x003bc;M): ELVd-(+)-AUC&#x02248;ELVd-(+)-GUC&#x0003e;ELVd-(+)-GUA&#x0003e;ELVd-(+)-AUA, with the fraction of self-cleaved molecules at the end-point of the reaction being higher than 95% in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). At higher magnesium concentration (500 &#x003bc;M), the self-cleavage rates were too fast to be analyzed manually (self-cleavage was essentially complete after 30 s, data not shown). Altogether these results indicate that the effects of changes in the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site follow the same tendency observed previously in artificial <italic>trans-</italic>acting hammerheads under high magnesium concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). However, they neither provide hints on why some catalytically sub-optimal trinucleotides like AUA have been selected in natural hammerheads, nor on why the catalytically most favorable trinucleotide AUC has been essentially excluded in natural hammerheads.</p></sec><sec><title>Co- and post-transcriptional self-cleavage may be different: a model for the lack of the trinucleotide AUC in most natural hammerheads</title><p>Because RNA folding occurs during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), we considered the possibility that certain trinucleotides preceding the self-cleavage site, particularly AUC, might promote the transient adoption of catalytically-inactive metastable structures. If these metastable structures are indeed formed (see Discussion and Supplementary Figure S1), we reasoned that they could be indirectly revealed by their differential effect on self-cleavage very early during transcription, whereas the differences would be attenuated late in transcription when the most stable catalytically-active hammerhead outcompetes the metastable structures. The experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) are consistent with this model. Self-cleavage of the ELVd-(+)-AUC hammerhead during the initial transcription instants (15 s) was significantly lower than that of the other three ELVd hammerheads (22 versus 46&#x02013;67%), whereas later in transcription (1.5 min) the differences were less conspicuous (78 versus 89&#x02013;91%), with self-cleavage being very similar for the four ELVd hammerheads (89&#x02013;94%) 10 min after initiating transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Analogous results were obtained in independent experiments in which the magnesium concentration of the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription mixture was, instead of 2 mM, 1 or 4 mM (data not shown). Following the approach for estimation of the self-cleavage rate constants during <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), the values obtained for the four ELVd (+) hammerheads (at 2 mM magnesium and pH 8) were: ELVd-(+)-GUA&#x0003e;ELVd-(+)-AUA&#x0003e;ELVd-(+)-GUC&#x0003e;ELVd-(+)-AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). During <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription the differences could be even higher because interactions with host proteins forming part of the replication complex might stabilize the metastable structures, thus explaining why the trinucleotide AUC, the catalytically most favorable in a post-transcriptional context, is essentially absent in natural hammerheads.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative analysis with other natural hammerheads reveals two ELVd (+) hammerhead derivatives as the catalytically most active at low magnesium concentration</title><p>To have a reliable estimate of the catalytic properties of the ELVd (+) hammerheads in relation to other known natural hammerheads, a self-cleavage kinetics analysis of the PLMVd (+), CChMVd (+) and sTRSV (+) hammerheads was performed at the same low magnesium concentrations. The morphology of these three hammerheads presents differences in the helices and loops but the trinucleotide preceding their self-cleavage sites is GUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At 10 &#x003bc;M magnesium, the self-cleavage rate constants of the PLMVd (+) and CChMVd (+) hammerheads were 5- to 6-fold lower than the comparable ELVd-(+)-GUC hammerhead (the ELVd variant with the same triplet preceding the self-cleavage site), whereas the self-cleavage rate constant of the sTRSV (+) hammerhead was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When compared with the fraction of self-cleaved molecules for the ELVd-(+)-GUC hammerhead at the end-point of the reaction (94%), the corresponding values for CChMVd (+) and, particularly, for the PLMVd (+) hammerheads were significantly lower (80 and 52%, respectively). At 50 &#x003bc;M magnesium the differences became somewhat diminished but the rate constant and the extent of self-cleavage of the ELVd-(+)-GUC hammerhead were still the highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, the latter hammerhead, and the ELVd-(+)-AUC mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), appear as the catalytically most active in this particular post-transcriptional context.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The study of hammerheads in their <italic>cis</italic> context and at the low magnesium concentration existing <italic>in vivo</italic> has still received limited interest, despite its implications for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism and biological diversity of natural hammerheads, as well as for the development of artificial <italic>trans-</italic>acting hammerheads with increased activity in physiological conditions. Here we have examined the self-cleavage kinetics at low magnesium concentration of the hammerheads described recently in ELVd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) and, from the effects of changes in the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site, we have tried to derive some clues about the rules governing the limited variability of this trinucleotide in natural hammerheads.</p><p>Starting from the ELVd (+) hammerhead, with an AUA trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site, we changed this trinucleotide into GUC. Due to the very similar morphology of both ELVd hammerheads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), this substitution transformed the ELVd (+) hammerhead in a derivative analogous to the ELVd (&#x02212;) hammerhead. Kinetic analysis at two low magnesium concentrations (10 and 50 &#x003bc;M) showed that the self-cleavage rate constant of the ELVd-(+)-GUC mutant was considerably higher than that of ELVd-(+)-AUA wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), raising the question of why two trinucleotides have been differentially selected in the two ELVd hammerheads. Moreover, under the same magnesium concentrations, the self-cleavage rate constants of the ELVd-(+)-AUC and ELVd-(+)-GUA mutants were similar to and somewhat lower than those of the ELVd-(+)-GUC mutant, respectively. Whereas the GUA trinucleotide precedes the self-cleavage site of two natural hammerheads (Table 1), why the catalytically very favorable trinucleotide AUC has been excluded in most natural hammerheads?</p><p>The effect of the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site on the rate constant has been previously studied in several artificial <italic>trans-</italic>acting hammerheads at high magnesium concentration. Although there are some discrepancies that probably reflect the distinct characteristics of specific hammerheads, the highest self-cleavage rate constants were observed for the trinucleotides GUC and AUC, whereas those for the trinucleotides GUA and AUA were significantly smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). These results parallel those reported here at low magnesium concentration with the <italic>cis-</italic>acting ELVd (+) hammerhead and its mutants, indicating that they are to a good extent independent of the <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> context.</p><p>In the framework of ELVd replication, the two trinucleotides preceding the self-cleavage site may have been differentially selected in the two hammerheads because of the need of differential self-cleavage rates during transcription of (+) and (&#x02212;) strands. Replication additionally entails subsequent ligation of the self-cleaved RNAs. It is not yet clear whether in hammerhead viroids of the family <italic>Avsunviroidae</italic> this is an enzyme-catalyzed reaction or it occurs non-enzymatically (self-ligation) giving rise to a 2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester bond [see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) for a Discussion], but the RNA structures promoting self-cleavage and ligation may well be not be the same and, consequently, the trinucleotides preceding the self-cleavage site may have an additional role in ligation. It is even possible that the higher rate and extent of ligation observed in a natural hammerhead with the interactions between loops 1 and 2 preserved could be relevant in physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), and that the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage/ligation site may have some influence. Moreover, in natural contexts this trinucleotide might play functional roles other than in cleavage and ligation. This is illustrated by the case of CChMVd, in which the (+) hammerhead has an extra A (A10) between the conserved A9 and the quasi-conserved G10.1. A10 causes a moderate decrease of the <italic>trans-</italic>cleaving rate constant with respect to the CChMVd (+) hammerhead without this residue, but because A10 also occupies a singular and indispensable position in the global CChMVd conformation as revealed by bioassays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), these results show that some hammerheads deviate from the consensus due to the involvement of certain residues in critical function(s) other than self-cleavage.</p><p>However, whereas the above arguments can explain why some catalytically sub-optimal trinucleotides have been selected in natural hammerheads, the reasons excluding the catalytically most favorable trinucleotide AUC in almost all natural hammerheads are probably different. We believe that this exclusion can be accounted by considering that self-cleavage during transcription and in a protein-free medium may be different. Following transcription of the first hammerhead nucleotides, they can be kinetically trapped in a catalytically-inactive structure. These structures, predicted for the ELVd-(+)-AUC, ELVd-(+)-GUC, ELVd-(+)-GUA, and ELVd-(+)-AUA hammerheads with the Kinefold program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) (Supplementary Figure S1), show that some trinucleotides preceding the self-cleavage site can potentially base pair with the CUGAU motif (hammerhead positions 3&#x02013;7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, the resulting interactions have different stability, with that formed by the trinucleotide AUC displaying the highest and, as a consequence, delaying self-cleavage. This model also explains why when in natural hammerheads the first nucleotide of the trinucleotide is A, the third must be also A (G is excluded because it would base pair with C3 and impede its role in the catalytic pocket, and U is also excluded because it can not form the complex array of non-canonical interactions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Once transcription of the hammerhead is completed, the kinetic trap can be released as a result of the alternative interactions that can be formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and the hammerhead can adopt its catalytically-active folding. Formation of the kinetic trap may be particularly facilitated in certain natural hammerheads, like the ELVd (+) hammerhead, with a long and stable helix I. It is also interesting to note that, in nature, an AUC trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site has been only found in the <italic>Schistosome douthitti</italic> hammerhead, whereas this trinucleotide is GUC in the other <italic>Schistosome</italic> spp. hammerheads deposited in databases. Due to the particular morphology of this hammerhead, adoption of a catalytically-inactive metastable structure cannot be facilitated by helix I because one of its strands is transcribed subsequently to all the other sequences forming the hammerhead. In summary, co- and post-transcriptional self-cleavage, particularly <italic>in vivo,</italic> may be different, with natural hammerheads having been probably selected through evolution to function under conditions for co-transcriptional self-cleavage. Hence, a deeper understanding of hammerheads (and probably other ribozymes) in their natural RNA context requires kinetic analysis not only in the <italic>cis-</italic>cleaving format but also during transcription. Pertinent to this point is the finding that transcription initiation of viroid strands occurs at specific sites, the location of which in the nascent strands is consistent with avoiding structures that disfavor the adoption of the catalytically-active hammerheads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the kinetics analysis here reported also shows that the ELVd-(+)-GUC hammerhead presents the highest rate constant and extent of self-cleavage (in low magnesium and in a post-transcriptional context) when compared with three other natural hammerheads from two viroids and one satellite RNA in which the trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site is also GUC. This may be the result of the high thermodynamic stability of the helices of the ELVd-(+)-GUC hammerhead that would facilitate the tertiary interactions between the peripheral regions important for catalysis. Therefore, this hammerhead, and the ELVd-(+)-AUC mutant, can serve as a base for designing new and efficient <italic>trans-</italic>acting hammerheads in which the tertiary interactions are preserved.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work has been partially supported by grants BFU2005-06808/BMC from the Ministerio de Educaci&#x000f3;n y Ciencia (MEC) and ACOMP06/141 from the Generalidad Valenciana (Spain).

In the scheme of the catalytically-active hammerhead (right) the pair X&#x02013;X represents C&#x02013;G or U&#x02013;A, and the Y represents C or A.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl717f6"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Structural characteristcs of some hammerhead ribozymes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hammerhead</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Helix I/loop 1<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">a</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Helix II/loop 2</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Helix III</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trinucleotide preceding the self-cleavage site (5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032;)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ELVd (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ELVd (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GUC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ELVd-(+)-GUC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GUC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ELVd-(+)-AUC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ELVd-(+)-GUA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GUA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PLMVd (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GUC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CChMVd (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GUC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">sTRSV (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GUC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">cscRNA (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GUA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">cscRNA (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">sLTSV (&#x02212;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GUA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">sCYDV-RPV (+)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Atypical<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">b</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUA</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p><sup>a</sup>Length of helices (in base pairs) and loops (in bases).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><p><sup>b</sup>Long helix II composed by segments of 5, 4 and 4 bp separated by internal loops and closed by a terminal loop of 4 bases.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></back></article>

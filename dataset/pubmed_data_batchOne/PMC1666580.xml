We demonstrate that the deglycanated core protein of syndecan-1 (SDC1) and not HS chains nor SDC2 or -4, appears to target the epithelial selective prosecretory mitogen lacritin. An important and novel step in this mechanism is that binding necessitates prior partial or complete removal of HS chains by endogenous heparanase. This limits lacritin activity to sites where heparanase appears to predominate, such as sites of exocrine cell migration, secretion, renewal, and inflammation. Binding is mutually specified by lacritin's C-terminal mitogenic domain and SDC1's N terminus. Heparanase modification of the latter transforms a widely expressed HS proteoglycan into a highly selective surface-binding protein. This novel example of cell specification through extracellular modification of an HS proteoglycan has broad implications in development, homeostasis, and disease.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: COX, cyclooxygenase; HS, heparan sulfate; HSG, human salivary gland ductal; NFATC1, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1; SDC1, syndecan-1.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell surface proteoglycans are key players in epithelial morphogenesis. They form gradients that immobilize mitogens in proximity to signaling receptors (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Laurie, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000e4;cker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Radtke and Clevers, 2005</xref>), contribute to cellular adhesion by ligating the ECM, and at least in one case participate in integrin coupling (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Beauvais et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">McQuade et al., 2006</xref>). Cell surface proteoglycans consist of a core protein and associated glycosaminoglycan chains, mainly heparan sulfate (HS). Current dogma states that mitogen, cytokine, and ECM binding is largely the domain of the anionic HS chains (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Couchman 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000e4;cker et al., 2005</xref>). HS chains are generated by a complement of Golgi polymerases, epimerase, and sulphotransferases during posttranslational modification. Each is thought to vary in relative activity by cell or tissue type (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Perrimon and Bernfield, 2000</xref>). Thus, within a given epithelium or endothelium, a structurally similar HS chain can be attached to genetically distinct core protein (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zako et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>New work has shed light on how HS proteoglycan specificity is generated in development and disease. Most involve extracellular enzymes that affect cell surface HS proteoglycans in unexpected ways. Removal of certain HS 6-<italic>O</italic>-sulfates by endo-6-<italic>O</italic>-sulfatases Sulf1 and -2 disrupts the binding of the bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor Noggin, leading to its dispersal and establishment of bone morphogenetic protein signaling (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Viviano et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, this same HS modification diminishes FGF binding and assembly with its signaling receptor (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2005</xref>). In another extracellular modification mechanism, HS cleavage by heparanase generates soluble fragments of HS that form complexes of FGF&#x02013;HS and trigger cellular proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 1998</xref>). In another mechanism, matrix metalloproteinase-7&#x02013;dependent shedding of the entire syndecan ectodomain promotes cancer-associated up-regulation of glypican-1 and tumor growth (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its HS-dependent signaling mechanisms, recent work has shown that the syndecan core proteins themselves participate as cell surface receptors. Their extracellular protein domains regulate the activation of integrins (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Beauvais and Rapraeger, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Beauvais et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">McQuade et al. 2006</xref>); bind growth factors, including Wnt, midkine, and pleitrophin (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Deepa et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Capurro et al., 2005</xref>); and disrupt carcinoma activity when added as recombinant competitors, presumably by disrupting their assembly with other signaling receptors at the cell surface.</p><p>Here, we report on a novel mechanism of syndecan-1 (SDC1) signaling that relies on a direct binding interaction of the extracellular core protein domain of the syndecan and modification of the proteoglycan by HS-modifying enzyme. The mechanism involves the partially characterized prosecretory mitogen lacritin, discovered as a consequence of a search for epithelial differentiation factors (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Sanghi et al., 2001</xref>). Lacritin is a small (12.3 kD) epithelial-selective human glycoprotein. Lacritin signals to stromal interaction molecule 1, mammalian target of rapamycin, and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATC1) via rapid PKC&#x003b1; dephosphorylation and phospholipase D activation (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) to potentially regulate differentiation, renewal, and secretion by the nongermative exocrine epithelia that it preferentially targets. With the exception of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dor et al., 2004</xref>), mechanisms of nongermative epithelial differentiation and renewal are poorly understood. Lacritin-deletion analysis identified a C-terminal mitogenic domain with amphipathic &#x003b1;-helical structure (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) common to many ligand&#x02013;receptor or ligand&#x02013;ligand binding sites (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barden et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Siemeister et al., 1998</xref>). We report here that lacritin's C terminus targets the SDC1 core protein as a prerequisite for mitogenesis. A second and novel prerequisite is prior modification or removal of HS from the syndecan by heparanase-1. We postulate that the localized action of heparanase converts a widely expressed cell surface proteoglycan into a localized lacritin-binding protein that is required for mitogenic signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Lacritin targets cell surface SDC1</title><p>Lacritin promotes epithelial proliferation at low nanomolar levels, suggesting a cell surface&#x02013;binding <italic>K</italic>

An apparent 190-kD cell surface protein eluted from lacritin but not control columns after incubation with detergent lysates of surface biotinylated human salivary gland ductal (HSG) cells in buffer containing physiological levels of NaCl (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Sequencing identified the 190-kD protein as a multimer of human SDC1, a transmembrane proteoglycan that acts as a coreceptor for mitogenic signaling by binding heparin binding growth factors such as FGFs, Wnts, Hhs, and hepatocyte growth factors via its HS glycosaminoglycan chains (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Esko and Selleck, 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>

The supernatant and pellet of the digest were then separately blotted for SDC1 using mAb B-B4 directed against the core protein. This revealed 190- and 80-kD bands, confirming the multimeric nature of the 190-kD SDC1 band (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Lacritin-bound SDC1 was consistently detected in the pellet, implying that the ligation was not solubilized by heparitinase/chondroitinase digestion and therefore may involve the core protein. In keeping with this possibility, lacritin did not target SDC2 or -4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) that share HS chains but only 27&#x02013;28% ectodomain identity with SDC1.

Could SDC1 binding and mitogenic sites be shared? SDC1 binding was unaffected by deletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) of 5 and 10 amino acids from the C terminus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) or 15 and 24 amino acids from the N terminus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>) of lacritin. However, affinity was substantially diminished after five more C-terminal amino acids were deleted (C-15) and completely abolished from C-25 and C-49 lacritin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These data point to a binding site between amino acids 100 and 109 of mature lacritin that mirrors the mitogenic domain. To validate and further probe this observation, lacritin-SDC1 affinity precipitations were competitively challenged with the truncated lacritin mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

Soluble hS1ED inhibited proliferation of lacritin-stimulated HSG cells in a dose-dependent manner. The same inhibitory doses had no effect on C-25&#x02013;treated cells or on FBS-stimulated proliferation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). To approach this question differently, HSG cells were depleted of SDC1 by siRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Dose-dependent depletion of SDC1, but not depletion of SDC2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>), completely abrogated lacritin mitogenic responsiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>).

We therefore examined COX2 expression in SDC1- and SDC2-depleted cells. In SDC1 but not SDC2 knockdown cells, lacritin-dependent COX2 expression was absent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>).

In contrast, native SDC1 without digestion presents as a broad smear (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511134/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511134/DC1</ext-link>). Also, lacritin affinity precipitated SDC1 was retained in the pellet after heparitinase/chondroitinase digestion. Could the sharply defined 190- and 80-kD bands represent a minor deglycanated or hypoglycosylated form preferentially enriched because of lacritin's apparent core protein&#x02013;related affinity? To explore this possibility, we sequentially depleted either FGF2- or lacritin-bindable SDC1 from lysates and then challenged the depleted lysates with lacritin or FGF2 affinity precipitation, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Affinity precipitates were treated with heparitinase/chondroitinase before SDS-PAGE to simplify mAb B-B4 detection of the core protein in the digest supernatant (FGF2) or pellet (lacritin). Successive pull-down with FGF2-GST depleted all FGF2-bindable SDC1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Interestingly, the amount of SDC1 available to interact with lacritin-intein was unaffected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, lane 4 vs. lanes 1 and 9). Similarly, depletion of SDC1 with lacritin-intein slightly but not substantially diminished SDC1 binding to FGF2-GST (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;7 vs. lanes 8 and 10). This implies that two pools of SDC1 may be available. One is apparently native SDC1, to which lacritin appears to lack affinity. The other may be an HS-free or partially deglycanated form of SDC1. Could the latter be an immature intracellular form? This appears not to be the case. When cells were gently trypsinized before lysis, no lacritin-bindable SDC1 was detected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>) in keeping with the original purification of labeled SDC1 from surface biotinylated cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Also ruled out was bacterial heparitinase contamination of recombinant lacritin. We took advantage of 3G10 mAb directed against a desaturated uronate epitope generated by heparitinase digestion (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">David et al., 1992</xref>) and could detect lacritin-bound SDC1 only after treatment with exogenous heparitinase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). That heparitinase can create the 3G10 epitope is revealing, for it points to the presence of HS or HS stubs on the core protein that is recognized by lacritin. HS stubs could be generated by heparanase, a eukaryotic endo-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucuronidase that cleaves the entire HS chains between GlcUA and GlcNAc linkages. Collectively, these data suggest that lacritin and FGF2 target different forms of cell surface SDC1. SDC1 bound by lacritin is less heterogenous, suggesting that although it is decorated with sufficient HS to be recognized by heparitinase, much of its HS has been removed.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>

Affinity precipitates were heparitinase/chondroitinase (+) treated before SDS-PAGE and blotting for SDC1, -2, or -4.

Where does lacritin bind? Steric hindrance by the N-terminal HS chains suggests that lacritin may bind SDC1's N terminus. However, binding might occur elsewhere when consideration is given to HS chain length and core protein folding. To examine these possibilities, we generated cell lines stably or transiently expressing human SDC1 lacking 51 N-terminal amino acids (del 1&#x02013;51), lacking amino acids 51&#x02013;252 of the ectodomain (del 51&#x02013;252), or retaining only the N-terminal 50 amino acids as a secreted form (del 51&#x02013;310; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>).

Is heparanase required for lacritin mitogenic binding of SDC1? Blotting for heparanase-1 detected the active 50-kD form that was enrichable on a HiTrap heparin column from both HSG and HEK293/SDC1 lysates (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>), in keeping with the known affinity of heparanase for heparin. The presence of heparanase in these fractions was confirmed in preliminary activity assays showing digestion of <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub>-labeled matrix (unpublished data). To assess whether heparanase-1 or -2 is required for lacritin-dependent proliferation, we treated HSG cells with siRNAs for each (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, B and C</xref>). Heparanase-1 is abundantly expressed and, when knocked down, reduced lacritin-dependent proliferation to background in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the lowest effective doses did not affect EGF-dependent mitogenesis, and depleted cells were rescued by addition of exogenous heparanase or heparitinase (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). In depleted cells without lacritin, neither had any effect (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511134/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511134/DC1</ext-link>), thus eliminating the possibility that rescue was instead from heparanase signaling (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gingis-Velitski et al., 2004</xref>). Heparanase-2 siRNA also had no effect (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>), but standard RT-PCR failed to detect heparanase-2 expression in untreated cells (not depicted), in keeping with real-time PCR detection of &#x0003c;15 mRNA copies/ng cDNA in human salivary gland (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">McKenzie et al., 2000</xref>).

To explore this possibility, each pool was isolated by affinity precipitation from <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub>-labeled cell lysates. After chondroitinase digestion and elution with NaCl, HS was cleaved from the core protein with NaBH<sub>4</sub> and analyzed by CL-6B gel filtration chromatography (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>). In contrast to unimodal HS from the FGF2 pool (<italic>K</italic>

We report a new mechanism in which the N-terminal deglycanated core protein of SDC1, and not complete HS/CS chains nor SDC2 or -4, appears to target the epithelial selective prosecretory mitogen lacritin. An important and novel step in this approach is that binding necessitates prior complete or partial removal of HS chains by endogenous heparanase (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Limiting lacritin activity to specific sites of secreted heparanase thus transforms widely expressed SDC1 into a regulated surface-binding protein.</p><p>Recent studies emphasize a growing appreciation for an interaction role of syndecan core proteins beyond the binding accomplished by their HS chains. Sdc1 regulates the activation of the &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;5 integrins in several cell types, an interaction that depends on functional coupling between an extracellular active site in the syndecan core protein and the integrins (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Beauvais and Rapraeger, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Beauvais et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">McQuade et al., 2006</xref>). HS plus a short extracellular hydrophobic region near the transmembrane domain of mouse Sdc1 inhibits ARH-77 human B lymphoid cell invasion into collagen I (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Langford et al., 2005</xref>). Recombinant human SDC2 core protein from <italic>E. coli</italic> mediates adhesion and proliferation of colon carcinoma cells (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2002</xref>), and mouse Sdc4 contains a high-affinity cell-binding domain proximal to HS attachment sites (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">McFall and Rapraeger, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Thus, the ectodomains of syndecan core proteins mediate several morphogenetic and homeostatic events.</p><p>Lacritin's preference for heparanase-deglycanated SDC1 core protein is an interesting cell-targeting strategy that successfully appropriates a ubiquitous proteoglycan for a role as a restrictive cell surface&#x02013;binding protein. That this is feasible is a reflection of the rarity of SDC1 as a part-time or hypoglycosylated proteoglycan and the lack of general ectodomain sequence conservation among syndecans. Focal heparanase release may regulate lacritin's mitogenic and prosecretory activity with unusual accuracy. Focal heparanase degradation of cell surface and ECM HS is implicated in glandular morphogenesis (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Zcharia et al., 2004</xref>), stem cell migration (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Zcharia et al., 2005</xref>), and cell survival (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>). It also plays a central role in inflammation and cancer (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Reiland et al., 2004</xref>). Activated endothelial (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2004</xref>) and T cells secrete heparanase during inflammation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fridman et al., 1987</xref>). Up-regulation of heparanase mRNA is correlated with reduced HS in invasive esophageal carcinomas (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mikami et al., 2001</xref>), whereas the opposite is linked to an increase in overall HS in differentiating myoblasts (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa et al., 2005</xref>). Our studies did not address whether SDC2 and -4 are functional targets of heparanase. Neither bound lacritin with or without prior heparitinase treatment. Nonetheless, exploration of other ligands may reveal a similar capacity for latency in these and other HS proteoglycans.</p><p>Heparanase-regulated proliferation has previously been attributed to the release of HS-bound FGFs in metastatic breast cancer (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 1998</xref>). Notably, the first lacritin EST in GenBank derives from a subtracted breast cancer library, and evidence has been presented for lacritin gene amplification in some metastatic breast cancers (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Porter et al., 2003</xref>). Others have proposed that lacritin is the second most frequent SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) marker for circulating breast cancer cells (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bosma et al., 2002</xref>). Sdc1 is required for Wnt-dependent breast cancer in mice (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alexander et al., 2000</xref>) and, in human cancers, is up-regulated in some but not others, coincident with a role in early proliferative events (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, lacritin, heparanase, and SDC1 together potentially offer a new paradigm for some human breast cancers.</p><p>Although the sequencing data did not expose lacritin's putative signaling receptor, use of pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA have identified proximal signaling elements as G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> or G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub>/PKC&#x003b1;-PLC/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calcineurin/NFATC1/COX2 and G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> or G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub>/PKC&#x003b1;-PLC/PLD1/mTOR (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Both are ERK1 and -2 independent and thus contrast with SDC1 cytoskeletal signaling. Lacritin signaling may thus involve a G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor or G protein&#x02013;dependent ion channel that gains ligand affinity as a consequence of lacritin immobilization on SDC1. Core protein binding may be stabilized by interaction with HS stubs detected in the lower molecular weight heparanase-dependent peak (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Interestingly, because lacritin- and FGF2-bindable SDC1 pools share some HS chains of similar size, not all HS on lacritin-bound SDC1 seem to be cleaved. Lack of complete competition of soluble lacritin for SDC1 in lacritin affinity precipitation assays versus N-24 might hypothetically result from folding of lacritin's more negatively charged N terminus onto its positively charged C terminus. Cleavage of HS by heparanase to generate lacritin-dependent mitogenic activity offers a novel mechanism of epithelial renewal with important implications to the physiology of human exocrine glands.</p><p>Collectively, these observations contribute to the growing appreciation of mechanisms by which extracellular enzymes regulate proteoglycan activity in unexpected ways.

Heparanase cleavage of HS promotes angiogenesis by solubilizing HS-bound growth factors (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Sanderson et al., 2004</xref>).

In competition assays, SDC1 lysates were mixed with increasing amounts of soluble lacritin, HS, HS plus CS (Seikagaku America), bacterially expressed human SDC1 ectodomain (hS1ED), native SDC2, native SDC4, N-24, or C-25. Mixtures were then applied to lacritin immobilized beads and further studied. For sequential pull-down assays, cell lysates were sequentially affinity precipitated with FGF2-GST or lacritin-intein. After FGF2-GST depletion of all available FGF-bindable SDC1, one half was precipitated with lacritin-intein. The other half was methanol precipitated overnight and resuspended in heparitinase buffer. Similarly, after lacritin-intein depletion of all available lacritin-bindable SDC1, one half was precipitated with FGF2-GST and the other half precipitated by methanol overnight and resuspended in heparitinase buffer. The reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted using anti-SDC1 mAb B-B4 (Serotec) or anti-SDC2 polyclonal antibody L-18 or anti-SDC4 polyclonal antibody N-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by ECL detection.</p><p>For SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, beads were digested with heparitinase I (Seikagaku America) and chondroitin ABC lyase (MP Biochemicals) because native syndecans migrate as a heterodisperse smear in SDS-PAGE. In brief, beads were resuspended in heparitinase buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 6.5, 50 mM NaOAc, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) with 0.0001 U heparitinase and 0.005 U chondroitin ABC lyase for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C. A second aliquot of each enzyme was added for an additional 2 h. Samples were diluted with 2&#x000d7; sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) for 4 h at 300 mA, fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 0.05% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich), and blocked overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in TBS (10 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) with 3% BSA. mAb B-B4 diluted in blocking buffer was incubated with blots for 2 h at RT, washed five times with 10 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20, and detected with alkaline-phosphatase&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) using ECL.</p></sec><sec><title>Heparanase detection</title><p>For analysis, cellular heparanase was enriched by HiTrap heparin affinity purification (GE Healthcare). In brief, HSG or HEK293 lysates were dialyzed overnight against binding buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7) and applied to the column. After washing with 10 column volumes of binding buffer, heparanase was eluted using 5 column volumes of elution buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate and 2 M NaCl, pH 7). Protein concentration was determined by BCA and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Heparanase-1 was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against human heparanase (provided by I. Vlodavsky, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Haifa, Israel) followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL.</p></sec><sec><title>Mitogenesis assay</title><p>HSG cells in serum-containing media were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well. After 24 h, the medium was changed to minimum essential medium alpha modification with washes for 24 h, and lacritin was added for 24 h to a final concentration of 10 nM in the same medium containing 2 &#x003bc;Ci/ml [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine. Cells were incubated alone with lacritin or together with an increasing amount of bacterial-expressed human SDC1 ectodomain (hS1ED) as a soluble inhibitor. Cells depleted of heparanase-1 or SDC1 were treated with lacritin in [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine 48 h after siRNA transfection. To rescue heparanase-depleted cells, &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;g heparanase enriched from HSG or HEK293 cells using heparin affinity column or 0.0001 U bacterial heparitinase (Seikagaku America) was added together with lacritin and [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine for 24 h. [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation was stopped by placing on ice. Cultures were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed with cold and RT TCA (10%) for 10 min each, washed twice with RT PBS, collected in 1 N NaOH, neutralized with 1 N HCl, and transferred to liquid scintillation vials for measurement.</p></sec><sec><title>HS chain analysis</title><p>50% confluent HSG cell cultures in 150-mm culture dishes were metabolically labeled with 50 &#x003bc;Ci/ml Na<sub>2</sub>

Both normal and heparanase-1&#x02013;depleted cells were labeled. After washing three times with PBS, cell lysates were collected and affinity precipitated with FGF2-GST or lacritin-intein overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. SDC1 bound to beads was digested with chondroitin ABC lyase (MP Biochemicals) for 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C, eluted with 2 M NaCl, and subjected to eliminative cleavage and reduction of HS by adjusting to 100 mM NaOH/1 M NaBH<sub>4</sub> for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Released HS was neutralized by drop-wise addition of 1 M HCl and subjected to Sepharose CL-6B column (1 &#x000d7; 57 cm) gel filtration chromatography in PBS at a flow rate 16 ml/h. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The void volume (V<sub>0</sub>, fraction 26) and total column volume (V<sub>t</sub>, fraction 62) were determined using dextran blue and sodium dichromate, respectively, as markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 displays the size heterogeneity of native SDC1 attributable to its HS and CS chains.

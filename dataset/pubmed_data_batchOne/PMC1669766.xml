Budding yeast Cdc13p contains two clusters of SQ/TQ motifs, suggesting that it might be a target of Mec1p/Tel1p (yeast ATR/ATM). Here we demonstrated that the telomerase recruitment domain of Cdc13p is phosphorylated by Mec1p and Tel1p. Gel analysis showed that Cdc13p contains a Mec1/Tel1-dependent post-translational modification. Using an immunoprecipitate (IP)-kinase assay, we showed that Mec1p phosphorylates Cdc13p on serine 225, 249, 255 and 306, and Tel1p phosphorylates Cdc13p on serine 225, 249 and 255 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Phenotypic analysis <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed that the mutations in the Cdc13p SQ motifs phosphorylated by Mec1p and Tel1p caused multiple telomere and growth defects. In addition, normal telomere length and growth could be restored by expressing a Cdc13&#x02013;Est1p hybrid protein. These results demonstrate the telomerase recruitment domain of Cdc13p as an important new telomere-specific target of Mec1p/Tel1p.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres are dynamic DNA&#x02013;protein complexes that protect the ends of linear chromosomes, prevent detrimental chromosome rearrangements and defend against genomic instability and the associated risk of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Telomeres, consisting of tandem repeats of short G-rich sequences, are synthesized by the enzyme telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The catalytic core of telomerase is composed of a reverse transcriptase and an RNA subunit. The reverse transcriptase utilizes the RNA component as a template to add the G-rich repeats onto the 3&#x02032; ends of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In most human somatic cells, telomerase activity is absent, and telomeres are gradually shortened with successive cell divisions due to incomplete replication, which eventually causes replicative senescence. Once telomeres become sufficiently short, they are thought to lose the ability to protect the ends of the chromosomes from being recognized as broken ends, and being subjected to nuclease digestion and active recombinational repair. Continuous telomere shortening in human fibroblasts leads to chromosome fusions, crisis and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Very few human cells can bypass the crisis either through telomerase reactivation or through an alternative recombination pathway for telomere lengthening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>In budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, several genes encoding components of the telomerase enzyme have been identified and mutations in these genes cause a gradual loss of telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). <italic>EST2</italic> and <italic>TLC1</italic> encode the reverse transcriptase catalytic protein subunit and the templating RNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In addition, the protein encoded by <italic>EST1</italic> is associated with the RNA component of telomerase and is bound to single-stranded telomeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Other accessory factors, such as Cdc13p, are required for the <italic>in vivo</italic> action of telomerase. Cdc13p is a single-strand telomere binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Studies of different alleles of <italic>CDC13</italic> revealed that Cdc13p is involved in both telomere protection and telomerase recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). A mutation allele of <italic>cdc13, cdc13-2</italic> (a Glu252&#x02192;Lys change), causes a gradual loss of telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) whereas a truncated form of <italic>cdc13, cdc13-5</italic> (an N-terminal amino acids 1&#x02013;694 fragment of Cdc13p), has long telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Genetic and physical interactions were also observed between <italic>CDC13</italic> and <italic>EST1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Therefore, Cdc13p may cooperate with Est1p to recruit telomerase to telomeres or activate telomere-bound telomerase for its replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, the maintenance of genome integrity relies on a set of surveillance systems, called checkpoints. These checkpoints are responsible for proper detection and repair of DNA damage caused by environmental stresses or irregularities during DNA metabolisms. Damage and replication defects are recognized by the putative protein complex containing protein kinases such as human ATM and ATR (ATM-related), and fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Rad3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). <italic>S.cerevisiae MEC1</italic> and <italic>TEL1</italic> are homologous to the human ATR and ATM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Mec1p and Tel1p function upstream in the checkpoint pathway by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the context of SQ or TQ motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Mec1p and Tel1p are important regulators of a group of proteins that detect, signal and repair DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Interestingly, the loss of Mec1p results in a modest decrease in telomere length, while telomeres are very short but stable in a <italic>tel1</italic> strain. Cells lacking both <italic>TEL1</italic> and <italic>MEC1</italic> have very short telomeres and undergo senescence similar to that observed in telomerase-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Furthermore, telomerase activation requires the ATM kinase functions in humans, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). These results suggest that proteins involved in DNA damage checkpoints may play a role in telomere replication.</p><p>We previously showed that <italic>CDC13, MEC1</italic> and <italic>TEL1</italic> are all involved in telomere&#x02013;telomere recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that Cdc13p is an <italic>in vivo</italic> target of Mec1/Tel1 kinases. The telomerase recruitment domain of Cdc13p is a direct substrate for the Mec1/Tel1 kinase as evident by the immunoprecipitate (IP)-kinase assay. Phosphorylation sites on Cdc13p were identified and the telomeric phenotypes of yeast strains carrying mutations on the phosphorylation sites were examined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids, yeast and telomere experiments</title><p>All the yeast operations were performed by standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>).

Wild-type yeast cells containing chromosomal Myc-tagged Cdc13p were subjected to western blot analysis to detect potential phosphorylation status. As telomere length was normal in cells expressing this Myc-tagged protein (data not shown), this tagged gene was able to provide the telomere functions of Cdc13p. Western blot analysis showed that levels of Cdc13-Myc were equivalent in the wild-type, <italic>mec1</italic> and <italic>tel1</italic>strains, but slightly decreased in the <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The migration of Cdc13p bands in gel was slightly faster in the <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> background, suggesting that Cdc13p might be phosphorylated in a <italic>MEC1/TEL1</italic>-dependent manner <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To test whether Cdc13p is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, we treated the Myc-antibody precipitated Cdc13p with phosphatase (PPase). When Cdc13p was treated with calf intestinal PPase, the smear bands of Cdc13p diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). PPase converted the electrophoretic behavior of Cdc13p from broad fuzzy bands to a sharp single band with greater mobility. When lysates were treated with PPase in the presence of the PPase inhibitor, Cdc13p migrated to a similar position of the untreated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 3). Because Cdc13p from the <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> strain still migrated as doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 4) and the gel mobility of Cdc13p in the <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> strain did not migrate to the same position as that of PPase-treated wild-type Cdc13p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 2 and data not shown), Cdc13p might be phosphorylated in a <italic>MEC1/TEL1</italic>-dependent as well as a <italic>MEC1/TEL1</italic>-independent manner <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Since Cdc13-Myc is a relatively big protein (118 kDa) and 1D gel electrophoresis was hard to clearly resolve the difference of modifications in Cdc13p, to gain further insight into the phosphorylations of Cdc13p by Mec1/Tel kinases, we separated these modified Cdc13p by using 2D gel electrophoresis. Different forms of Cdc13p were resolved by isoelectric focusing (pH 4&#x02013;7 linear gradient) followed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and then detected by western blotting using a Myc antibody. In addition to the predicted Cdc13p-Myc at pI 5.31 (spot 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), a variant form at pI 5.22 (spot 1) (assuming the linearity of the supplied pH gradient gels) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, in the <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> strain, this spot disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). PPase-treatment also made the spot 1 of Cdc13p of wild-type strain vanished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that the expression of a variant Cdc13p was contributed by Mec1/Tel1 kinases-mediated phosphorylation. Owing to the limited availability of commercial strips for isoelectric focusing gel, we could not further improve the separation between spot 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Therefore, we could not rule out the possibility that there are other variant(s) of Cdc13p between spot 1 and 2 contributed by <italic>MEC1/TEL1</italic>-dependent as well as <italic>MEC1/TEL1</italic>-independent regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>The telomerase recruitment domain of Cdc13p is phosphorylated by Mec1/Tel1 immunoprecipitates</title><p>The simplest explanation for the <italic>MEC1/TEL1</italic>-dependent Cdc13p phosphorylation is that Cdc13p is directly phosphorylated by Mec1p/Tel1p. The ATM/ATR family of kinases has a preference for phosphorylation of serine in SQ motifs or threonine in TQ motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Cdc13p contains 10 such motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, these types of S/TQ motifs are usually located in clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Two such clusters in Cdc13p were found: one in the telomerase recruitment domain (RD) (S225, S249, S255 and S306) and the other in the DNA binding domain (DBD) (S611, S643 and S652) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As the first step in determining whether Cdc13p is a substrate of Mec1p/Tel1p, we tested whether Mec1p/Tel1p could phosphorylate Cdc13p <italic>in vitro</italic>. Immunoprecipitated Mec1 and Tel1 kinases were tested for its ability to phosphorylate Cdc13p. Mec1p and Tel1p immunoprecipitates were incubated under <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase conditions in the presence of [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and recombinant GST-Cdc13(129&#x02013;332) or GST-Cdc13(570&#x02013;676) containing the telomerase recruitment or DNA binding domain, respectively. The reactions were subjected to SDS&#x02013;PAGE and autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The phosphorylated GST-Cdc13(129&#x02013;332) subunit was observed, while neither GST alone (data not shown) nor the GST-Cdc13(570&#x02013;676) protein showed detectable phosphorylation by Mec1p or Tel1p. To confirm that Mec1 kinase activity was indeed required for Cdc13 phosphorylation, assays were conducted using extracts isolated from a <italic>mec1</italic> mutant strain. Strain KSC1752 [<italic>mec1-HA</italic>(<italic>KD</italic>)] expresses an HA-tagged Mec1-kd protein with two amino acid changes in its catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Based on assays using equivalent amounts of protein, inactivation of Mec1 kinase activity completely eliminated Cdc13p phosphorylation. Similar results were observed by the Tel1 kinase dead protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results demonstrate that Mec1/Tel1 kinases phosphorylate the telomerase recruitment domain of Cdc13p.</p></sec><sec><title>S225, S249, S255 and S306 are the <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation sites of Cdc13p</title><p>In order to locate the sites of phosphorylation on Cdc13p, GST was fused to the amino acids 185&#x02013;275 and 276&#x02013;332 of the telomerase recruitment domain of Cdc13p, independently. These two recombinant GST-fusion proteins were then purified and used as substrates in IP-kinase assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, both GST-fusion proteins were labeled by Mec1p, but only the 185&#x02013;275 fragment of Cdc13p was phosphorylated by Tel1p. There are three SQ sites (residue 225, 249 and 255) within the 185&#x02013;275 fragment of Cdc13p and one SQ site (residue 306) within the 276&#x02013;332 fragment of Cdc13p. To determine the exact phosphorylation sites, we purified mutant GST-Cdc13p containing single, double or triple serine (S) to alanine (A) mutations at these sites. These substrates were then used in the IP-kinase assay. Compared to wild-type Cdc13p, phosphorylation of the triple mutant Cdc13(185&#x02013;275) subunit was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with the previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the Cdc13(276&#x02013;332), but not the Cdc13(276&#x02013;332)S306A, was phosphorylated by Mec1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results indicate that the phosphorylation sites of Cdc13p by Mec1p are located at amino acids 225, 249, 255 and 306, and the phosphorylation sites of Cdc13p by Tel1p are located at amino acids 225, 249 and 255. Therefore, we conclude that S225, S249, S255 and S306 are the major phosphorylation sites of Cdc13p by Mec1/Tel1 kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotypic analysis of <italic>cdc13-S</italic> mutants</title><p>To identify the potential cellular functions for Mec1/Tel1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc13p, we tested whether mutations in these phosphorylation sites would affect the growth and replication of telomeres. In order to examine these phenotypes, a strain STY1077 was created in which the chromosomal <italic>CDC13</italic> gene was deleted and was complemented by <italic>CDC13</italic> on a single-copy <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). STY1077 was transformed with either <italic>CDC13</italic> or different <italic>cdc13-S</italic> mutant genes on low-copy plasmids. Cells carrying <italic>cdc13-S</italic> mutants were obtained following selection against the <italic>CDC13</italic> plasmid by growth on 5-FOA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, single mutations from S to alanine (A), aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E) at 249 and 255 all caused telomere shortenings, indicating that these two residues are important for telomere maintenance. Moreover, while single mutations S225A and S306A caused no observable telomere and growth defects, single mutations S249A and S255A maintained short telomeres stably after several streakings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and data not shown) and double mutations S249/255AA resulted in gradual telomere shortening and cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The S225/249/255AAA triple mutant grew poorly even in the first restreak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and the S225/249/255/306AAAA mutant was lethal on the tetradissection plates (data not shown). Interestingly, this cellular senescence of S249/255AA mutant was not observed in mutation from S to D (S249/255DD) or E (S249/255EE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Short telomeres were stably maintained in these double mutations S249/255DD and S249/255EE strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and data not shown), suggesting that modified acidic charge residues may partially mimic phosphorylation status and suppress the phenotype. The expression pattern of Cdc13p (Supplementary Figure S1) and the amount of single-stranded telomeres (Supplementary Figure S2) of individual mutant in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> are quite similar to those of wild-type, suggesting that these phenotypic alterations may not be related to protein stability and telomere binding ability of Cdc13p, respectively. Altogether, these results highlight the significance of these phosphorylation sites for the telomere replication by the telomerase.</p></sec><sec><title>S249 and S255 of Cdc13p are required for the efficient <italic>in vivo</italic> action of telomerase</title><p>To determine whether these phosphorylations are essential for the action of telomerase <italic>in vivo</italic>, we tested the sudden telomere elongation by the <italic>in vivo</italic> telomerase assay developed by Diede and Gottschling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Strains were arrested in M phase by nocadazole treatment, and then subjected to induction of <italic>HO</italic> expression. In contrast to wild-type cells which showed telomere elongations at the HO cut site, the TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>/HO end was not elongated in S249/255AA and S249/255EE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These results indicate that phosphorylation of Cdc13p at amino acids 249 and 255 are required for the proper <italic>in vivo</italic> addition of telomeres.</p></sec><sec><title>Telomere lengthening by targeted Est1p occurs efficiently in the absence of the Mec1/Tel1 phosphorylation sites of Cdc13p</title><p>We demonstrated that <italic>cdc13</italic> phosphorylation mutants exhibited a strong defect in the telomere length regulation. Because these phosphorylation sites exist in telomerase recruit domain, we hypothesized that the recruitment of telomerase was blocked due to a reduced protein&#x02013;protein interaction between Cdc13p and Est1p. We speculated that the <italic>cdc13</italic> mutation would be suppressed if telomeric binding of Est1p was forced by expression of a hybrid protein consisting of Cdc13p and Est1p. To test this, we examined the consequences of fusing Cdc13p to Est1p in telomere maintenance. We transformed wild-type and <italic>cdc13</italic> cells with the plasmid p<italic>CDC13&#x02013;EST1</italic> (expressing the Cdc13&#x02013;Est1 fusion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Efficient telomere lengthening occurred in the <italic>cdc13</italic> mutant (&#x0003e;600 bp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and the growth defect of <italic>cdc13</italic> mutant cells was suppressed by the transformation of p<italic>CDC13-EST1</italic> or p<italic>cdc13-EST1</italic>-S249/255AA (data not shown). This phenotype was observed in every clone that we analyzed, although in the p<italic>cdc13-EST1</italic>-S249/255AA containing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lane 6) the extent of telomere elongation was slightly shorter than that in the p<italic>CDC13-EST1</italic> containing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lane 5). These results confirmed that the telomere length defect associated with the phosphorylation mutation of Cdc13p can be complemented by targeting Est1p onto the telomere.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutations at the Mec1p/Tel1p phosphorylation sites do not affect the Cdc13p&#x02013;Pol1p interaction</title><p>It is possible that the phosphorylation site mutants might be simply improperly folded or otherwise perturb Cdc13p functions. To demonstrate that some activity of these <italic>cdc13</italic> mutants is preserved, we tested the Cdc13p&#x02013;Pol1p interaction in <italic>cdc13-</italic>AA mutants. Cdc13p was shown to interact with Pol1p, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase &#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Disruption of the activity of the lagging strand DNA replication machinery leads to unregulated elongation of the G-rich strand, accompanied by an impaired ability to regulate synthesis of the C-rich strand. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). These data suggested that DNA polymerase &#x003b1; and Cdc13p play an important role in the coordination of telomerase action and the replication of the C-rich strand at chromosome ends. We demonstrated that Cdc13p interacted with Pol1p in a two-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Moreover, mutations in the Mec1p/Tel1p phosphorylation sites did not cause a loss of interaction. These results indicate that the phosphorylation mutations of Cdc13p may not perturb the global folding of Cdc13p.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The telomerase recruitment function of Cdc13p was previously demonstrated by expression of a Cdc13p&#x02013;Est1p or a Cdc13p&#x02013;Est2p fusion protein which supplants the need for Est1p in telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), Cdc13p&#x02013;Est1p two-hybrid interaction and other biochemical criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Here we report that the telomerase recruitment domain of Cdc13p is regulated by checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Tel1. Blockage of the Mec1p/Tel1p-mediated phosphorylation in Cdc13p results in an obstacle of telomere lengthening and cell proliferation. Although it remains possible that these mutations may affect sites of phosphorylation rather than simply eliminating phosphorylation sites, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data prefer the idea that those sites are direct substrates of Mec1/Tel1 kinases. Interestingly, the Cdc13p S249/255EE mutant does not display senescence phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that the negative charge residues in these glutamic acids may mimic the Mec1p/Tel1p-mediated phosphorylation. However, it still exhibits telomere shortenings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and defect of <italic>de novo</italic> telomere addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) under our assay condition. One explanation for these results is that Cdc13&#x02013;EEp might partially, but not completely, replace the function of Mec1p/Tel1p-mediated phosphorylation on Cdc13p.</p><p>It was shown previously that a <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> strain has an <italic>est</italic> phenotype: its telomeres progressively shorten, and <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> cells senesce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Furthermore, when the Cdc13&#x02013;Est1p fusion protein was expressed in <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> cells, telomere length was even longer than in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), which bypass the cellular senescence phenotype of the <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Our results elucidate that the cellular senescence phenotype of the <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> cells was derived from the lack of phosphorylation of Cdc13p S249 and S255 at the telomerase recruitment domain by Mec1p/Tel1p. Once this telomerase recruitment function is provided by the fusion protein, <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> cells no longer senesce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Moreover, the reduction of Cdc13p level in <italic>mec1 tel1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) may also partly contribute to the senescent phenotype.</p><p>There is an intriguing correlation between single-strand DNA binding proteins and checkpoint signaling. For example, RPA was shown to be required for the &#x02018;adaptation&#x02019; response in the presence of a double strand break (DSB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). Zou and Elledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>) showed that human ATRIP and yeast Ddc2 interact directly with RPA-coated ssDNA. Here we investigated the functional regulation between the checkpoint sensor kinases and single-strand telomere binding protein Cdc13. This study was undertaken since a variety of experimental results have implicated Mec1p&#x02013;Tel1p in checkpoint control in yeast telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). Moreover, we found previously that Cdc13p and Mec1p&#x02013;Tel1p are all involved in telomere&#x02013;telomere recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). The sites involved in the Mec1&#x02013;Tel1-mediated regulation in Cdc13p are very close to previously determined Cdc<sup>EST</sup> site of Cdc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) further highlighting the importance of this regulation. The role of Mec1p/Tel1p in the regulation of Cdc13p at telomeres may be evolutionarily conserved, as their functional homologues are present in human cells.</p><p>The controversy as to when and where Mec1p and Tel1p act still exists. Theoretically, phosphorylation may also be possible to be involved in the modification of Cdc13p prior to loading to telomeres. We found that S306 is only phosphorylated by Mec1p <italic>in vitro</italic>. Whether various post-translational modifications occur at different cell cycle and whether this regulates the timing on the action of telomerase remain to be determined. In addition, we also observed some <italic>MEC1/TEL1</italic>-independent phosphorylation of Cdc13p. Whether these phosphorylations mediate other functions of Cdc13p and what kinase(s) contribute to <italic>MEC1/TEL1</italic>-independent phosphorylation are under investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs Zee-Fen Chang, Ming-Kai Chern, Kou-Juey Wu and Tsai-Kun Li for their discussions and critical comments.

In addition to eliminating aberrant mRNAs, NMD regulates the expression of wild-type genes, as &#x0223c;5&#x02013;10% of the yeast, human or <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcriptome is altered in NMD deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>To identify PTC-containing transcripts, the NMD machinery should efficiently discriminate between authentic stop codons and PTCs. At least two (not mutually exclusive) models have been suggested to explain how NMD recognizes PTCs. The first model (often referred to as the pioneer translation or nuclear marking model) suggests that <italic>cis</italic>-acting NMD elements are present in the coding region but not in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) of wild-type mRNAs. In the nucleus, NMD <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors bind to the NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements and are transported with the mRNAs into the cytoplasm. During the pioneer round of translation, ribosomes displace the NMD <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors from wild-type mRNAs. However, if translation is stopped at a PTC, the NMD <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors bound downstream of the PTC are retained on the mRNA. These mRNA-bound NMD factors recruit further NMD components including UPF1, thereby leading to formation of functional NMD complexes and rapid degradation of the PTC-containing mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The second model (the <italic>faux</italic> UTR model) proposes that translation termination on PTC-containing mRNAs is aberrant because their 3&#x02032;-UTR lacks the factors required for normal termination. This model suggests that aberrant translation termination results in assembly of a functional NMD complex, thus leading to rapid decay of PTC-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>UPF3, UPF2 and UPF1 proteins are required for NMD in yeast, worm, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Although these core <italic>trans</italic>-acting NMD factors are conserved, the <italic>cis</italic>-acting NMD elements are different in mammals and in yeast. In mammalian cells, introns are believed to be the predominant <italic>cis</italic>-acting NMD elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). When either a U12 or a U2 intron is spliced, a multiprotein complex called the exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited on the mRNA 20&#x02013;25 nt upstream of each exon&#x02013;exon junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). As introns are rare in the 3&#x02032;-UTR, the EJC marks the coding regions of mRNAs. UPF3, a component of the mammalian EJC, recruits UPF2 in the perinuclear space. If translation is stopped at a PTC, UPF3&#x02013;UPF2 complexes located downstream of the PTC can recruit UPF1 and other NMD factors to form functional NMD complex. As translating ribosome remove EJCs located upstream of the stop codon as well as EJCs that are located downstream but in close proximity to a stop codon, mammalian transcripts are targeted by NMD only if a stop codon resides &#x0003e;50&#x02013;55 nt upstream of an exon&#x02013;exon junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). In yeast, loosely defined sequences called DSE elements can render an mRNA subject to NMD if they are located downstream of a stop codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Hrp1p specifically binds to DSE sequences and might recruit UPF proteins to the mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Both the intron (EJC) and DSE-based PTC definition systems conform to the nuclear marking model. However, a long 3&#x02032;-UTR can also subject mRNAs to NMD in yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and worm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Moreover, mammalian mRNAs with long 3&#x02032;-UTRs are also targeted by NMD, although less efficiently than mRNAs containing introns in the 3&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The finding that long 5&#x02032;-UTRs act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements can be explained by the <italic>faux</italic> UTR model. Normal translation termination requires the interaction of terminating ribosome and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). By preventing this interaction, an unusually long 3&#x02032;-UTR could lead to aberrant termination and formation of functional NMD complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>The events of NMD-mediated mRNA decay downstream of functional NMD complex formation are not well understood. In yeast and human cells, NMD complex formation results in decapping and deadenylation of PTC-containing mRNA, while in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it leads to cleavage of aberrant mRNAs close to the PTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Decapped and/or deadenylated mRNAs are degraded in specific cellular compartments called P-bodies by normal mRNA decay pathways involving XRN1 and the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In animals, SMG-1, SMG-5, SMG-6 and SMG-7 are also required for NMD. SMG-1 phoshporylates UPF1, while SMG-5, SMG-6 and SMG-7 are involved in dephosphorylation of UPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>NMD also operates in higher plants, although very little is known about mechanism or function of plant NMD systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). A computer search identified one putative ortholog for UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Indeed, alternative splicing products containing PTCs accumulate to high levels in an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> line carrying a UPF3 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported that the null mutant of putative UPF1 is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), while the missense mutant <italic>lba1</italic> shows strong phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic>-acting NMD elements have not yet been identified in plants. The findings that PTC-containing mRNAs derived from intronless genes are efficiently targeted by plant NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) suggest that long 3&#x02032;-UTRs or DSE-like elements can act as <italic>cis</italic> factors in plants. The role of plant introns in PTC definition is still under debate. In rice waxy gene, splicing of an intron upstream of the PTC affected the efficiency of NMD. These data were interpreted to indicate that splicing and NMD were coupled in plants, as in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). However, in mammals only introns positioned downstream of the PTC could act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements. Moreover, other reports suggested that plant introns present in the 3&#x02032;-UTR did not subject mRNAs to NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>We have elaborated an agroinfiltration-based transient NMD test system to define the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements of plant NMD and to identify plant UPF1. We show that both long 3&#x02032;-UTRs and introns located in the 3&#x02032;-UTR act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> factors. As both long 3&#x02032;-UTR-based and intron-based PTC identification systems operate in plants as well as in animals, it is likely that these PTC definition systems already existed in the common ancestor of stem eukaryotes. We have also shown that tethering of UPF1 to either the 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-UTR causes a dramatic reduction of target mRNA levels, suggesting that in plants, UPF1 binds to the mRNA in a late, irreversible phase of NMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>For the agroinfiltration assays, genes were cloned into the BIN61S binary vector between the 35S promoter and terminator sequences.

Therefore, as a first step towards characterization of plant NMD, we wanted to establish an efficient transient NMD assay system. It has been shown that the wild-type bean phytohemagglutinin (PHA) mRNA is stable, while the mutant mRNA containing a PTC (PHA-m) is efficiently targeted by NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In transgenic tobacco cells, the half-lives of PHA-m transcripts were reduced 3-fold relative to the PHA transcripts; consequently PHA-m mRNAs accumulated to &#x0223c;5 times lower levels than PHA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). We have adapted this well-characterized NMD reporter gene system to establish an agroinfiltration-based transient plant NMD assay (also see Materials and Methods). PHA and PHA-m, which contains a PTC at codon 79, were cloned into binary vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and then <italic>N.tabacum</italic> leaves were infiltrated with <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> cultures carrying PHA or PHA-m binary plasmid. As an internal control, the ORF of PHA-m from ATG to the PTC (PHA-s) was also cloned into a binary vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and then the <italic>Agrobacteriu</italic>m-containing PHA-s was co-infiltrated with either PHA or PHA-m. Moreover, as agroinfiltration leads to strong transgene-induced RNA silencing, P14 silencing suppressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) was also co-infiltrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Thus, leaves were co-infiltrated with PHA + PHA-s + P14 or with PHA-m + PHA-s + P14 cultures. At 3 days post infiltration (d.p.i.) RNA gel blot assays were performed to monitor mRNA accumulation. PHA and PHA-m transcript levels were normalized to the levels of the PHA-s common internal control; therefore PHA and PHA-m mRNA levels could be compared. The finding that PHA-m mRNA levels were &#x0223c;10 times lower than PHA mRNA levels suggested that PHA-m transcripts were targeted by NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare lanes 3&#x02013;4 to 1&#x02013;2 and Supplementary Figure 2). As NMD is a translation-dependent RNA degradation system, treatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide stabilizes PTC-containing mRNAs. To confirm that NMD is responsible for the reduced PHA-m mRNAs levels, PHA and PHA-m infiltrated leaves were treated with cycloheximide. As expected, cycloheximide treatment resulted in strongly increased PHA-m mRNA levels (3.75&#x000d7;), but did not enhance PHA mRNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These data support the conclusion that in agroinfiltrated leaves PHA-m mRNA levels are downregulated by NMD.</p><p>In worms, the NMD and RNA silencing pathways overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Thus, because UPF1 may be involved in RNA silencing in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), it was possible that the P14 silencing suppressor modified the NMD response. To exclude this possibility, we repeated the experiments in the absence of P14 but at a lower temperature (15&#x000b0;C), where RNA silencing is inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). We found that at 15&#x000b0;C, in the absence of P14, PHA-m mRNAs accumulated to much lower levels than PHA transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data suggest that, in contrast to RNA silencing, NMD is active even at low temperature and indicate that P14 does not affect NMD. Consistently, PHA transcripts were &#x0223c;10 times more abundant than PHA-m mRNAs when these genes were expressed at the normal growth temperature from a specific binary vector (NOSas) that barely triggers silencing (S. Kertesz, Z. Merai and D. Silhavy, unpublished data).</p><p>As these data suggest that P14 has no effect on NMD, further agroinfiltration-based NMD experiments were carried out at 22&#x000b0;C in the presence of the P14 silencing suppressor.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> UPF1</title><p>UPF1 is the key <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor responsible for NMD in yeast as well as in animals. Based on sequence similarities, it has been suggested that At5g47010 encodes UPF1 (UPF1) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Moreover, as many PTC-containing transcripts are upregulated in a missense mutant or in T-DNA insertion mutants of At5g47010, it is likely that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> UPF1 is a functional ortholog of yeast UPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). However, direct evidence proving that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> UPF1 is involved in NMD have not yet been reported. To test whether plant UPF1 plays a role in NMD, it was amplified by RT&#x02013;PCR, cloned into a binary vector, and then the effect of overexpression of UPF1 on NMD was studied in agroinfiltration assays. As co-infiltration of UPF1 did not result in increased PHA-m transcript levels, we concluded that overexpression of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> UPF1 did not affect NMD in tobacco leaves (data not shown).</p><p>It has also been reported that changing of a conserved arginine to cysteine in the RNA helicase domain of either yeast (R779C) or human (R844C) UPF1 leads to a dominant-negative protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). We hypothesized that if At5g47010 encodes the functional <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> UPF1, a similar change of the corresponding arginine (R863C) will also lead to a dominant-negative protein (UPF1DN, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and that expression of UPF1DN will interfere with NMD. To test these hypotheses, PHA-s control and PHA-m NMD reporter constructs were co-infiltrated with UPF1DN. Importantly, co-expression of UPF1DN selectively increased the levels of PTC-containing PHA-m transcripts, providing evidence that UPF1DN interfered with NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare lanes 7&#x02013;8 to 3&#x02013;4 and Supplementary Figure 2). Western-blot assays confirmed that UPF1 and UPF1DN proteins accumulated to comparable levels (data not shown); thus, the different effects of these proteins on NMD are not due to differences in abundance. These data strongly suggest that UPF1 plays a role in plant NMD, and that UPF1DN is a dominant-negative mutant. In further experiments, UPF1DN co-infiltration assays were used to identify NMD-targeted mRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Long 3&#x02032;-UTR can act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> element in plant</title><p>We next wanted to identify the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements of the plant NMD system. As PHA-m is a strong NMD target, whereas PHA or PHA-s mRNAs are not targeted by NMD, it is likely that sequences between the PTC of PHA-m and its original stop codon (referred to as <italic>abc</italic> region, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) contain <italic>cis</italic>-acting NMD elements. To exclude the unlikely possibility that specific intramolecular interactions play a role in the instability of PHA-m transcripts, we cloned the <italic>abc</italic> region downstream of the stop codon of a binary GFP reporter construct (GFP-<italic>abc</italic>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). If the <italic>abc</italic> region contains <italic>cis</italic>-acting NMD elements, GFP-<italic>abc</italic> mRNAs should be targeted by NMD. To test this hypothesis, <italic>N.benthamiana</italic> leaves were infiltrated with <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> carrying either the GFP-<italic>abc</italic> test or the GFP control construct. We found that the green fluorescence of GFP-<italic>abc</italic> infiltrated leaves was much weaker than the fluorescence of GFP infiltrated leaves. Moreover, GFP-<italic>abc</italic> mRNAs accumulated to very low levels relative to GFP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, co-infiltration of UPF1DN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, compare lanes 7&#x02013;8 to 3&#x02013;4, and see Supplementary Figure 3) or cycloheximide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, compare lanes 3&#x02013;4 to 1&#x02013;2) led to selective increase of GFP-<italic>abc</italic> mRNA levels. These data indicate that GFP-<italic>abc</italic> transcripts are targeted by NMD. Thus, we concluded that the <italic>abc</italic> region contained all the necessary information for PTC definition.</p><p>Although it has been shown that in plants PTC-containing mRNAs transcribed from intronless genes are targeted by NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), it is not known if DSE-like short, specific destabilizing sequences or unusually long 3&#x02032;-UTRs subject these mRNAs to NMD. To distinguish between these two possibilities we tried to map the DSE-like destabilizing sequences in the <italic>abc</italic> region. The <italic>abc</italic> region was divided into three sequences &#x0223c;equal in size (&#x0223c;200 nt), and then each region was cloned downstream of the stop codon of the GFP binary construct yielding GFP-<italic>a</italic>, GFP-<italic>b</italic> and GFP-<italic>c</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To test if any of these constructs is targeted by NMD, GFP-<italic>a</italic>, GFP-<italic>b</italic>, GFP-<italic>c</italic> test and GFP control constructs were agroinfiltrated alone or were co-infiltrated with UPF1DN. We have found that GFP-<italic>a</italic>, GFP-<italic>b</italic> and GFP-<italic>c</italic> transcripts accumulated to comparable levels and that these mRNAs were less abundant than the control GFP transcript. It is likely that GFP-<italic>a</italic>, GFP-<italic>b</italic> and GFP-<italic>c</italic> mRNAs were moderately targeted by NMD because co-infiltration of UPF1DN resulted in slightly increased transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and Supplementary Figure 4). These data suggest that the <italic>abc</italic> region does not contain DSE-like destabilizing sequences, thus it is likely that the extended 3&#x02032;-UTRs trigger NMD in plants. Moreover, as GFP-<italic>abc</italic> was much more efficiently targeted by NMD than GFP-<italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), GFP-<italic>a</italic> or GFP-<italic>b</italic> (data not shown), it is likely that the length of 3&#x02032;-UTR defined the efficacy of NMD. Indeed, we found that GFP-<italic>bc</italic> mRNAs accumulated to higher levels than GFP-<italic>abc</italic> but were less abundant than GFP-<italic>b</italic> or GFP-<italic>c</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and Supplementary Figure 5).</p><p>To further confirm that long 3&#x02032;-UTRs and not DSE-like sequences act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements in plants, 700, 500 and 300 nt long bacterial sequences derived from GUS gene were cloned downstream of PHA-s (P-G700, P-G500, P-G300, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It is unlikely that bacterial sequences contain plant DSE-like sequences, thus the finding that bacterial sequences destabilized plant transcripts further supported the model that long 3&#x02032;-UTRs triggered NMD in plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistently, the longest GUS segment caused the strongest reduction of PHA-s mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, compare lanes 7&#x02013;8 to 3&#x02013;4).</p></sec><sec><title>Introns located in the 3&#x02032;-UTR could act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements in plant</title><p>Introns are efficient NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements in mammals. To clarify if introns located in the 3&#x02032;-UTR could act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements in plants, we cloned the well-characterized potato ST-LS1 intron (referred to as Ls) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) downstream of the GFP-<italic>c</italic> reporter gene (GFP<italic>c</italic>-Ls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The effect of Ls intron on mRNA accumulation was studied in agroinfiltration assays by comparing the expression levels of the GFP<italic>c</italic>-Ls test and the GFP-<italic>c</italic> control constructs. The green fluorescence was much weaker in GFP<italic>c</italic>-Ls infiltrated plants than in GFP-<italic>c</italic> infiltrated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> Supplementary Figure 6A). Consistently, GFP<italic>c</italic>-Ls mRNAs accumulated to low levels, while GFP-<italic>c</italic> mRNAs were abundant. RT&#x02013;PCR assays confirmed that Ls was efficiently spliced from GFP<italic>c</italic>-Ls (Supplementary Figure 6C). Co-infiltration of UPF1DN with GFP<italic>c</italic>-Ls resulted in stronger fluorescence and in dramatically increased GFP<italic>c</italic>-Ls mRNA levels (11&#x000d7;). Therefore, we concluded that the 3&#x02032;-UTR located Ls intron could trigger NMD-mediated degradation of GFP<italic>c</italic>-Ls mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and Supplementary Figure 6B). Consistent with these data, cycloheximide treatment led to increased GFP<italic>c</italic>-Ls mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>To exclude that the effect of Ls intron is gene specific, we have also cloned the Ls intron 28 and 99 nt downstream of the stop codon of the PHA-s binary construct yielding P-28Ls and P-99Ls, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and then leaves were infiltrated with either of these constructs. In these experiments PHA was used as an internal control. RT&#x02013;PCR confirmed that the Ls intron was efficiently spliced from both P-28Ls and P-99Ls mRNAs (Supplementary Figure 6D). We found that P-99Ls mRNAs accumulated to low levels in the infiltrated leaves, while P-28Ls mRNAs were abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, co-infiltration of UPF1DN resulted in increased accumulation of P-99Ls mRNAs (4.31&#x000d7;) but only slightly enhanced the levels of P-28Ls mRNAs (1.66&#x000d7;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Consistently, cycloheximide treatment resulted in increased P-99Ls mRNA levels (3.63&#x000d7;) but did not lead to elevated P-28Ls mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These data suggest that introns located in the 3&#x02032;-UTR can trigger NMD and that this effect is position-dependent. Plant introns located downstream but close proximity to the stop codon fail to act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements, whereas introns located more downstream of the stop codon could trigger NMD.</p></sec><sec><title>Tethering of UPF1 to either the 3&#x02032;- or 5&#x02032;-UTR of a mRNA leads to low target transcript levels</title><p>In mammals, tethering of UPF1 to the 3&#x02032;-UTR of a wild-type mRNA leads to rapid degradation of the targeted mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). In contrast, tethering of UFP1 to the 5&#x02032;-UTR or to the open reading frame of an intronless mRNA enhances its translation, because UPF1 promotes mRNA polysome association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Interestingly, UPF2, UPF3 and certain EJC proteins act similarly, tethering of these proteins to the 3&#x02032;-UTR triggers rapid mRNA degradation, while their tethering to the ORF enhances translation of target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Since introns act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements in both mammals and plants, we have postulated that in addition to NMD, plant UPF1 also stimulates translation. To test these hypotheses we constructed a binary vector, which expresses UPF1 as a &#x003bb;N fusion protein (&#x003bb;N-UPF1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). &#x003bb;N specifically binds a short RNA sequence called the boxB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). To create a 3&#x02032;-UTR target construct, five copies of boxB as direct repeats were inserted downstream of GFP reporter gene (GFP3&#x02032;boxB, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and then GFP3&#x02032;boxB was infiltrated alone or was co-infiltrated with &#x003bb;N-UPF1. As controls, GFP3&#x02032;boxB was also co-infiltrated with &#x003bb;N or UPF1 binary constructs. While co-infiltration of &#x003bb;N or UPF1 affected the target mRNA levels only slightly, GFP3&#x02032;boxB transcript levels were strongly reduced in &#x003bb;N-UPF1 co-infiltrated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, compare lanes 7&#x02013;8 to 1&#x02013;2 and Supplementary Figure 7). Similarly, co-infiltration of &#x003bb;N-UPF1 also reduced the transcript levels of P-3&#x02032;boxB (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), another 3&#x02032;-UTR tethering target construct that contained five boxB repeats downstream of PHA-s reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data indicate that tethering of plant UPF1 to the 3&#x02032;-UTR of a wild-type mRNA leads to downregulation of the targeted mRNA.</p><p>We next tested the effect of UPF1 tethering to the 5&#x02032;-UTR of a reporter mRNA. To create a 5&#x02032;-UTR tethering target construct, five boxB sequences as direct repeats were cloned into the 5&#x02032;-UTR region of GFP reporter gene (GFP5&#x02032;boxB, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). GFP5&#x02032;boxB was infiltrated alone or was co-infiltrated with &#x003bb;N-UPF1, with &#x003bb;N or with UPF1, respectively. Unfortunately, we failed to detect GFP activity in the GFP5&#x02032;boxB infiltrated leaves (perhaps because inserted sequences contain ATGs), therefore we could not analyse the effect of 5&#x02032;-UTR tethering of UPF1 on translation efficiency. However, we could study the effect of 5&#x02032;-UTR tethering of UPF1 on target mRNA accumulation. Surprisingly, co-infiltration of &#x003bb;N-UPF1 severely reduced the levels of GFP5&#x02032;boxB transcripts, while co-infiltration of &#x003bb;N or UPF1 did not modify the accumulation of GFP5&#x02032;boxB mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Tethering of UPF1 to the 5&#x02032;-UTR region of the PHA-s reporter construct (P-5&#x02032;boxB, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) also led to dramatically reduced target mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>It is unlikely that tethering of UPF1 to an mRNA would lead to transcriptional silencing of the corresponding gene; therefore we suggest that tethering of UPF1 to either the 3&#x02032;- or 5&#x02032;-UTR causes reduced transcript accumulation because it triggers rapid degradation of targeted mRNA. As NMD is a translation-coupled decay system, the finding that 5&#x02032;-UTR tethering of UPF1 also causes low transcript levels is an unexpected result. It is possible that in plants, unlike in mammals, UPF1 joins the NMD complex in a late, irreversible phase of complex formation, thus artificial tethering of UPF1 to any part of an mRNA results in rapid decay of that transcript.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title><italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-based transient plant NMD assay</title><p>Transient assays have been efficiently used to analyse NMD in mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. As transient NMD assays often require the expression of several different genes, and because agroinfiltration is the best method to co-express many different genes in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>), we have established an agroinfiltration-based transient plant NMD test system. We have shown that PTC-containing mRNAs accumulate to low levels relative to wild-type controls and that the levels of PTC-containing mRNAs are selectively increased by cycloheximide treatment or by co-expressing UPF1DN, a dominant-negative mutant of plant UPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). These data indicate that in agroinfiltrated leaves PTC-containing mRNAs were targeted by NMD. We think that this versatile transient NMD test system, in combination with UPF1DN co-expression and &#x003bb;N-boxB tethering assay systems can become useful tools to characterize plant NMD.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Cis</italic> elements of plant NMD</title><p>Taking the advantage of the transient NMD test system, we have identified the <italic>cis</italic> elements of plant NMD. We found that in plants stop codons are identified as PTC if the 3&#x02032;-UTR is unusually long or if an intron is located in the 3&#x02032;-UTR.</p><p>Previous reports have shown that intronless mRNAs can be degraded by NMD in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Consistently we have found that intronless mRNAs are targeted by NMD if a PTC is introduced into the coding region or if stuffer sequences are cloned into their 3&#x02032;-UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). As we failed to identify DSE-like destabilizing sequences and because insertion of either bacterial or plant sequences into the 3&#x02032;-UTR triggered NMD, we concluded that long 3&#x02032;-UTR subjected intronless mRNAs to NMD in plants. Moreover, we have shown that this effect was size-dependent, mRNAs with longer 3&#x02032;-UTR were more effectively targeted by NMD than transcript with shorter 3&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Long 3&#x02032;-UTR could also trigger NMD in yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, worm and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). The <italic>faux</italic> UTR model of yeast NMD suggests that long 3&#x02032;-UTR (and perhaps other unusual 3&#x02032;-UTRs) causes aberrant translation termination and that aberrant termination leads to the formation of a functional NMD complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). As PTC-containing yeast mRNAs can be protected from NMD if PABP is tethered downstream of the stop codon, it is likely that long 3&#x02032;-UTR causes aberrant termination by inhibiting the interaction of terminating ribosome with PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Our findings that long 3&#x02032;-UTR triggers NMD in plants and that this transcript destabilizing effect depends on the size of the 3&#x02032;-UTR can be explained if the <italic>faux</italic> UTR model is valid for plant NMD. Therefore, we suggest that aberrant translation termination also leads to NMD in plants and that increasing the distance between terminating ribosome and PABP results in aberrant termination.</p><p>Introns could also act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements in plants. The finding that incorporation of Ls intron into the 3&#x02032;-UTR of either the GFP or PHA-s transcripts subjects these mRNAs to NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) supports this conclusion. Moreover, the effect of plant introns on mRNA stability is position-dependent. mRNAs carrying Ls intron 99 nt downstream of the stop codon were targeted by NMD, while transcripts carrying the same intron 28 nt downstream of the stop codon did not trigger NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and D). In mammals, introns located less than 50&#x02013;55 nt downstream of the stop codon also fail to trigger NMD. As 3&#x02032;-UTR located introns trigger NMD in a similar position-dependent manner in both plants and mammals, we suggest that in plants, like in mammals, EJC connects splicing and NMD. Indeed, the putative orthologs of most EJC components were identified in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). However, in plants, unlike in mammals, the 3&#x02032;-UTR tethering of EJC proteins does not result in the decay of targeted mRNAs (Supplementary Figure 8). Therefore further experiments are required to prove that plant EJCs are directly involved in NMD.</p><p>Our data that introns can act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements in plants are apparently conflicting with previous studies. It has been suggested that introns do not trigger NMD in barley, because mRNAs containing introns downstream of the PTC and the control transcripts accumulated to comparable levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). However, the transcript which was used as a control in that study also carried a PTC, therefore the control transcript could be also targeted by NMD. Indeed, both the intron containing and control mRNAs accumulated to 3-fold lower levels than the corresponding wild-type mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Rose has shown that incorporation of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ubiquitin intron 80 nt downstream of the stop codon of the GUS reporter gene did not result in reduced reporter mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In mammals, different introns trigger NMD with different efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). It is possible that the Ls intron triggers NMD more effectively than the ubiquitin intron. Alternatively, in plants, the intron should be more distant than 80 nt downstream of the stop codon to trigger NMD.</p><p>Identification of NMD <italic>ci</italic>s elements allows the recognition of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes, which could be regulated by NMD. Structural targets could be transcripts with an intron in the 3&#x02032;-UTR, mRNAs with long 3&#x02032;-UTR, or mRNAs containing an upstream ORF (uORF) in their 5&#x02032;-UTR region. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis shows, that &#x0223c;30% of plant mRNAs contain uORF. We have identified &#x0223c;1000 genes whose 3&#x02032;-UTRs are longer than 500 nt and found that 3.6% of all <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes contain intron in their 3&#x02032;-UTRs (list of genes are available as Additional Materials, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.abc.hu/RNA/"/>). Therefore, it is likely that NMD also plays a role in regulation of many wild-type genes in plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolution of PTC definition</title><p>As the putative UPF1, 2 and 3 orthologs can be identified in each eukaryotic lineages and because the NMD system has not been found in prokaryotes, it is likely that NMD evolved in the stem eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). However, the evolution of NMD system is not well understood. As long 3&#x02032;-UTR triggers NMD in yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, worm and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>), it has been suggested that this PTC definition system is ancient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), perhaps it was already present in the stem eukaryotes. Our result that long 3&#x02032;-UTRs also trigger NMD in plants supports this hypothesis. The evolution of intron-based PTC definition is more debated. Based on the findings that introns are not NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements in yeast or <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it has been suggested that the intron-based PTC definition evolved late, only when alternative splicing had become dominant in certain animal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). An alternative model of NMD evolution has proposed that the intron-based PTC definition has already operated in the stem eukaryotes. This model suggests that splicing and NMD were coupled by the EJC in these ancient organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). As the EJC components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>) and many introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>) are highly conserved in eukaryotes, this model hypothesizes that in stem eukaryotes EJC-based NMD could efficiently eliminate PTC-containing mRNAs of spliced transcripts, thereby providing primary positive selection for the intron containing alleles. Consequently, NMD facilitated the rapid spreading of ancient introns in stem eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). The finding that 3&#x02032;-UTR located introns trigger NMD in a position-dependent manner in plants is consistent with this model. This model also predicts that introns should be &#x0223c;evenly distributed within the coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). Indeed, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>) have shown that plant introns are distributed relatively equally along the coding regions except the very 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions (Additional Materials).</p><p>Taken together, our findings suggest that both long 3&#x02032;-UTR and intron-based PTC definition systems could operate in stem eukaryotes. In lineages, in which intron loss dominated (yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> etc.), splicing and NMD could be evolutionarily uncoupled, thus long 3&#x02032;-UTR became the dominant NMD <italic>cis</italic> element. In contrast, in the extremely intron-dense lineages, where alternative splicing is very widely used (mammals), introns could become the more efficient and dominating NMD <italic>ci</italic>s elements. Although, plants are intron-dense organisms, intronless genes are also frequently found in the plant genome, thus NMD machinery has evolved under dual constrains, it should efficiently identify PTC-containing mRNAs derived from either intronless or intron containing genes. Therefore, both long 3&#x02032;-UTR and intron-based PTC recognition machinery should work efficiently in plants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec>

Labelled PHA fragment was used as a probe. PHA and PHA-m (test) transcript levels were normalized to the levels of PHA-s internal control mRNAs. Mean values of normalized transcript levels were calculated from three independent samples (only two are shown on the blot), and then these mean transcript levels were compared.

Bracketed bold numbers (shown below the relative mRNA levels) refer to the fold change, the ratio between treated and non-treated samples. PHA or PHA-m transcript levels of the UPF1DN co-infiltrated samples were compared to the corresponding PHA or PHA-m levels of PHA + PHA-s + P14 and PHA-m + PHA-s + P14 samples.

GFP-<italic>abc</italic> (G-<italic>abc</italic>), GFP-<italic>bc</italic> (G-<italic>bc</italic>), GFP-<italic>c</italic> (G-<italic>c</italic>) and GFP mRNA levels were normalized to the corresponding P14 levels, and the mean GFP-<italic>abc</italic> transcript level was taken as 1. (<bold>E</bold>) Bacterial sequences inserted into the 3&#x02032;-UTR of a plant mRNA triggers NMD. The length of the inserted bacterial sequences is in correlation with the intensity of NMD. 700, 500 or 300 nt sequences from GUS gene were inserted downstream of the stop codon of PHA-s (P-G700, P-G500 and P-G300). P-G700, P-G500 and P-G300 cultures were co-infiltrated with P14 (lanes 3&#x02013;8) or with P14 + UPF1DN (lanes 9&#x02013;14). As a control for dominant-negative effect, PHA-m + PHA-s + P14 cultures were infiltrated or were co-infiltrated with UPF1DN (PHA-m + PHA-s + P14 + UPF1DN). These control samples were run on the same gel (lanes 1 and 2). RNA gel blot was hybridized with PHA-s probe. Samples and photos were taken at 3 d.p.i.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl737f3"/></fig><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Introns located in the 3&#x02032;-UTR could act as NMD <italic>cis</italic> elements.

These mixtures were also co-infiltrated with UPF1DN (P-28Ls + PHA + P14 + UPF1DN, lanes 9&#x02013;10, P-99Ls + PHA + P14 + UPF1DN, lanes 13&#x02013;14). To exclude that the different 3&#x02032;-UTR length of P-28Ls and P-99Ls transcripts is responsible for the different accumulation, identical but intronless constructs (P-28 and P-99) were infiltrated and analysed in parallel. Blot was hybridized with a PHA-s probe. Upper bands show PHA control transcripts, while the lower bands correspond to P-28Ls, P-28, P-99Ls or P-99 test mRNAs. Test mRNA levels were normalized to the corresponding PHA transcript levels. Note that the OD of the PHA control culture was 0.01, while the ODs of other cultures were 0.2.

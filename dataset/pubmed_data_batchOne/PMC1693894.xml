This modification causes a release of PARP-1 from DNA ends and initiates a variety of responses including DNA repair. While PARP-1 has been firmly implicated in base excision and single strand break repair, its role in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) remains unclear. Here, we show that PARP-1, probably together with DNA ligase III, operates in an alternative pathway of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) that functions as backup to the classical pathway of NHEJ that utilizes DNA-PKcs, Ku, DNA ligase IV, XRCC4, XLF/Cernunnos and Artemis. PARP-1 binds to DNA ends in direct competition with Ku. However, in irradiated cells the higher affinity of Ku for DSBs and an excessive number of other forms of competing DNA lesions limit its contribution to DSB repair. When essential components of the classical pathway of NHEJ are absent, PARP-1 is recruited for DSB repair, particularly in the absence of Ku and non-DSB lesions. This form of DSB repair is sensitive to PARP-1 inhibitors. The results define the function of PARP-1 in DSB repair and characterize a candidate pathway responsible for joining errors causing genomic instability and cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Endogenous cellular processes and exogenous factors, such as ionizing radiation (IR) generate highly cytotoxic double strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA that undermine genomic integrity.

The initial non-reciprocal translocation event, as well as the subsequent steps in the amplification process requires joining of DNA ends. Due to the defect in the DNA-PK dependent pathway (D-NHEJ), end joining must be carried out in these mutants by an alternative process prone to missjoining and possibly utilizing microhomologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Alternative pathways of end joining are also implicated in genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), in the formation of soft tissue sarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and in the aberrant coding and signal joints formed during V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) in NHEJ mutant mice.</p><p>Furthermore, alternative forms of end joining operate in the repair of IR-induced DSBs. Mutants with defects in NHEJ show pronounced inhibition but still rejoin the majority of DSBs by a slowly operating pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Because this repair pathway does not show dependence on genes of HRR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), it is thought to reflect an alternative form of end joining that functions as backup (B-NHEJ) to the DNA-PK dependent pathway (D-NHEJ).</p><p>These results implicate alternative pathways of end joining in genomic integrity through contributions to DSB repair, particularly when D-NHEJ is compromised. However, due to their low fidelity, the same repair pathways are directly implicated in genomic instability and cancer. Despite the potentially grave consequences of their functions, little is known about the biochemistry of these pathways, as well as the mechanisms of their regulation and integration into the cellular DNA DSB processing machinery, beyond the observation that they frequently utilize microhomologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>Recent work identifies DNA ligase III as a candidate factor in alternative pathways of NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) and points to PARP-1 as an additional potential contributor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). PARP-1 is an abundant nuclear enzyme of higher eukaryotes that has been implicated in many cellular processes including DNA repair. It is a member of a superfamily of eighteen proteins containing PARP domains, of which only PARP-2 has also been implicated in DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). The 116 kDa PARP-1 has two zinc finger motifs that mediate binding to single strand breaks (SSBs) and DSBs. This binding enables the protein to cleave NAD<sup>+</sup> to nicotinamide and ADP-ribose and to form branched ADP-ribose polymers on glutamic acid residues of target proteins, including itself.</p><p>PARP-1 is involved in SSB repair, BER or NER, together with XRCC1, DNA ligase III, as well as polynucleotide kinase (PNK), PCNA and FEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and plays an essential role in removing lesions converted to DSBs during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Although PARP-1 is implicated in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) the results are variable and the mechanism unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>).

PARP-1 and PARP-1 DBD were visualized with a rabbit anti-PARP-1 antibody (Calbiochem). pADPr was detected with rabbit anti-pADPr antibody (Calbiochem). Intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels were determined in irradiated and non-irradiated cells using an enzymatic cycling assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). For indirect immunofluorescence, cells grown on poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine treated coverslips were permeabilized with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 300 mM Sucrose, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer) and 0.5% Triton X-100 and were subsequently incubated with 10% TCA (20 min, RT) and then with 0.5% Nonidet P40 (5 min).

Immunofluorescence was evaluated with a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS4, Leica, Germany). A mouse monoclonal antibody against Ku70, clone N3H10 and Ku80, clone 111, were from Kamiya Biomedical Co. (Seattle, WA); a mouse monoclonal antibody against GAPDH, from Chemico International. Semi-purified PARP-1 (specific activity: 261 nmol ADP-ribose/min/mg total protein at 25&#x000b0;C) was from Biomol (Hamburg).

Cells were embedded in agarose (InCert agarose, BioRad) and processed for lysis. In divergence to the original protocol and in order to reduce conversion of heat labile sites to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), high temperature was avoided during lysis. Agarose blocks were lysed in a buffer (pH 8.0) containing 400 mM EDTA, 2% NLS, 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K at 4&#x000b0;C for 16 h; they were subsequently washed with TE buffer and incubated for 24 h at 4&#x000b0;C in a solution containing 1.85 M NaCl, 0.15 M KCl, 4 mM Tris, 0.5% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5). PFGE was carried out, after RNAase treatment, in 0.5% agarose gels cast in the presence of ethidium bromide, in 0.5&#x000d7; TBE at 8&#x000b0;C for 40 h using alternating cycles of 50 V (1.25 V/cm) for 900 s in the forward direction and 200 V (5.0 V/cm) for 75 s in the reverse direction. Gels were scanned in the Typhoon and analyzed using the ImageQuant software (GE Biosciences). The fraction of DNA released (FDR) from the well into the lane is a measure of DSBs present. FDR measured in non-irradiated samples (background; usually between 2&#x02013;8%) was subtracted from FDR measured in samples exposed to IR.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> plasmid end joining</title><p>To document a role for PARP-1 in DNA end joining <italic>in vivo</italic> we employed a fast-readout plasmid rejoining assay utilizing the plasmid pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). The plasmid was digested with HindIII, or I-SceI, to remove Ad2 and generate different types of ends. Supercoiled pEGFP-Pem1 was used as a positive control to standardize the transfection and analysis conditions. The pDsRed2-N1 plasmid (Clontech) was co-transfected with either linearized pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 or supercoiled pEGFP-Pem1 as a control of transfection efficiency. Plasmids were transfected using the MEF1 nucleofector kit in the Nucleofector devise (Amaxa) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Green (EGFP) and Red (DsRed) fluorescence were measured by flow cytometry 24 h later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The EGFP signal in this assay increases initially, approximately linearly, with increasing amount of plasmid, but reaches at higher concentrations a plateau in a cell-line-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). To avoid measurements near the plateau region that compromise quantification, calibration curves were generated for each cell lines using circular pEGFP-Pem1 plasmid (M. Wang and G. Iliakis, unpublished data). The results were used to select cell-line-dependent amounts of linear pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 plasmid allowing evaluation of the effects of PARP-1 inhibitors in each cell line. However, since different cell lines have different calibration curves and because the results obtained have not been normalized against a common standard, the signal levels shown cannot be taken as a direct measure of the DNA end joining capacity of each cell line&#x02014;i.e. they do not directly reflect the absolute end joining levels of each cell line.</p><p>For cell cycle analysis, cells were trypsinized and fixed in 70% ethanol.

The genetic and biochemical implication of DNA Ligase III, with which PARP-1 frequently cooperates, in backup pathways of end joining (see Introduction) offer alternative ways of interpretation for existing data and a rationale for the formulation of alternative hypotheses. We reasoned that if PARP-1 is involved in backup pathways of NHEJ, a way for documenting this contribution would be by applying PARP-1 inhibitors to D-NHEJ deficient mutants or by combining PARP-1 with DNA&#x02013;PK inhibitors.</p><p>In the repair proficient human glioma M059K cells, 3&#x02032;-aminobenzamide (3&#x02032;-AB) has no detectable effect on DSB repair (Supplementary Figure 1B and C), although immunofluorescence of poly(ADP-ribose) shows that PARP-1 activity is significantly reduced (Supplementary Figure 1A). We reasoned that if PARP-1 is involved in alternative pathways of NHEJ, exposure of D-NHEJ deficient mutants to PARP-1 inhibitors should uncover this contribution. Therefore, the same experiment was carried out in M059J cells that lack DNA&#x02013;PK activity due to a frameshift mutation in <italic>DNA&#x02013;PKcs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). M059J cells show reduced efficiency for DSB rejoining after IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), as compared to M059K cells, but repair nevertheless the majority of DSBs with slow kinetics via DNA&#x02013;PK independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Despite the defect in D-NHEJ, treatment with 3&#x02032;-AB fails to inhibit DSB rejoining (Supplementary Figure 1B and C); similar results are obtained with DPQ, another widely used PARP-1 inhibitor (data not shown).</p><p>Ligation is the final step in DNA end joining and D-NHEJ recruits DNA ligase IV in this function. Compared to wild-type cells, <italic>LIG4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells have significantly reduced rejoining efficiency but remove over 70% of DSBs with slower kinetics through a DNA ligase IV-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Treatment with 3&#x02032;-AB has no effect on wild-type cells, but exerts a small effect on <italic>LIG4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells.</p><p>A prerequisite for PARP-1 activation and therefore involvement in DSB repair is binding to DNA ends. In the above mutants and despite the defects in DNA&#x02013;PKcs and DNA ligase IV, Ku is present at normal intracellular levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). We reasoned that in the absence of key D-NHEJ components, Ku will bind DNA ends non-productively and will exert a dominant negative effect that will limit the engagement of PARP-1. To examine this possibility, we tested a radiation sensitive Chinese hamster mutant, xrs-6, defective in Ku80 as a result of a nonsense mutation, and a corrected clone, xrs-6/Ku80, derived by ectopic expression of human <italic>Ku80</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Ku80 deficiency compromises DSB rejoining in xrs-6 cells as compared to xrs-6/Ku80, but here again alternative pathways remove over 80% of DSBs within 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While DPQ has no detectable effect on DSB rejoining in corrected cells, it produces a clear inhibition in xrs-6 cells. The greater inhibition of DSB repair is not caused by a greater inhibition of PARP-1 in <italic>Ku80</italic> deficient cells, as similar inhibition is observed for both types of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Despite slight differences in response, DPQ is also effective in inhibiting DSB rejoining in fibroblasts derived from <italic>Ku70<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This result suggests that the observed phenotype is not a peculiarity of Ku80 deficient Chinese hamster cells, but can also be observed in <italic>Ku70<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> MEFs. Thus, in agreement with competition against Ku, the contribution of PARP-1 to alternative pathways of NHEJ is clearly detectable in Ku deficient, very small in <italic>LIG4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and undetectable in DNA&#x02013;PKcs deficient cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of PARP-1 DBD inhibits rejoining of DNA DSBs</title><p>Overexpression of the PARP-1 DNA-binding domain (DBD) causes a trans-dominant inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation interrupting several functions of PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Because the PARP-1 DBD can in principle also bind to DNA ends and compete with Ku, we wished to evaluate the effect of its expression on the rejoining of IR-induced DNA DSBs. We introduced this approach, first because high levels of PARP-1 DBD are expected to generate efficient competition against Ku for DNA ends and second because it offers a useful alternative to chemical inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). We measured rejoining of DSBs in a cell line, COM3, conditionally expressing PARP-1 DBD under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter (Supplementary Figure 2A). No changes in PARP-1 levels and no PARP-1 DBD expression are observed after treatment with dexamethasone in COR3 cells that only express the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR). COM3 cells show detectable induction at 5 nM dexamethasone and steady further increase up to 500 nM, where expression reaches levels comparable to those of COC1 cells. Expression of PARP-1 DBD using 50 nM dexamethasone inhibits IR-induced PARP-1 activation, as measured by poly(ADP-ribose) analysis by western blotting (Supplementary Figure 2B), immunofluorescence (Supplementary Figure 2C) or the intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> pools (Supplementary Figure 2D). Similar results were obtained at higher concentrations of dexamethasone. Overexpression of PARP-1 DBD has been previously shown to inhibit DNA DSB rejoining in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> demonstrate that under our conditions PARP-1 DBD expression causes a modest inhibition in DNA DSB rejoining, which is enhanced after inhibition of DNA&#x02013;PK with wortmannin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Wortmannin alone causes a strong delay in DSB rejoining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), although here again the majority of DSBs are removed by DNA&#x02013;PK independent processes. The stronger effect of PARP-1 DBD expression on DSB rejoining, as compared to chemical inhibitors, on D-NHEJ deficient background suggests effects beyond PARP-1 inhibition and points to DNA-binding in competition with Ku.</p></sec><sec><title>PARP-1 contributes to the rejoining of plasmid DSBs in Ku or DNA ligase IV deficient cells</title><p>To further test the postulated competition between PARP-1 and Ku, we introduced an <italic>in vivo</italic> plasmid end joining assay. The assay allows, in addition to the generation of defined DSBs, also follow up of their repair in cells without other forms of DNA damage; IR exposed cells carry a 20-fold excess of SSBs and base damages compared to DSBs that compete for PARP-1. In this rapid-readout, direct-reporting plasmid assay, end joining is measured by the restitution of EGFP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>).</p><p>Principal characteristic of the plasmid (pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2) used in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is the interruption of the EGFP sequence by the Pem1 intron, within which restriction sites for HindIII and I-SceI are engineered upstream and downstream of the Ad2 exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Digestion with HindIII at both sites generates a linear plasmid with cohesive 5&#x02032;-overhangs, whereas digestion with I-SceI at both sites and because of their inverted orientation, incompatible 3&#x02032;-overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Because of the retention of the Ad2 exon, partial digestion at only one restriction site generates upon ligation a product unable to express EGFP. Due to the &#x02018;buffering&#x02019; capacity of the intron, end joining of transfected, linearized plasmid by the cellular repair apparatus reconstitutes EGFP expression, even when extensive additions or deletions of nucleotides have occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). As a result, a wide spectrum of end joining events can be detected.</p><p>When HindIII linearized plasmid is introduced into Ku proficient cells, intracellular circularization allowing EGFP expression is detected and quantitated by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It is evident that plasmid rejoining in these cells is not affected by PARP-1 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In Ku80 deficient xrs-6 cells, on the other hand, the overall repair efficiency is lower. This may be a reflection of the reduced efficiency of B-NHEJ, the intracellular instability of the plasmid and the overall design of this experiment that preclude conclusions on ultimate end joining levels as is the case in experiments with genomic DNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). However, residual end joining of HindIII linearized plasmid is reduced over 60% by 3&#x02032;-AB or DIQ in Ku deficient cells, thus implicating PARP-1 in DSB rejoining under these conditions. A similar reduction in end joining is also observed in I-SceI linearized plasmid suggesting that the pathway rejoins both compatible as well as incompatible DNA ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). A Chinese hamster mutant with defect in DNA&#x02013;PKcs shows no reduction in DNA end joining after treatment either with 3&#x02032;-AB or DIQ, suggesting a specific inhibitory effect for Ku on PARP-1 mediated end joining.</p><p>We carried out similar experiments using <italic>LIG4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) to examine whether the small effect of PARP-1 inhibition observed in irradiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) can be amplified in the plasmid assay that employs non-irradiated cells. Treatment of wild-type MEFs with 3&#x02032;-AB or DIQ produces no effect on DNA end joining in HindIII digested plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). In <italic>LIG4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs, plasmid end joining is also observed, but in contrast to wild-type cells, treatment with 3&#x02032;-AB or DIQ reduces end joining by over 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). A similar effect is observed with plasmid digested with I-SceI to generate incompatible ends. Thus, the plasmid assay detects a clear contribution of PARP-1 to DSB end joining when D-NHEJ is compromised by a defect in <italic>LIG4</italic>.</p><p>To examine whether Ku interferes with DNA end joining even under conditions where D-NHEJ is compromised by defects in proteins other than Ku, we knocked down Ku in <italic>LIG4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. With the selected (from three tested) siRNA sequence, western blotting shows a 70% knock-down effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Ku knock-down is accompanied by a nearly doubling in the efficiency of end joining in <italic>LIG4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Excess rejoining observed after Ku knock-down involves PARP-1, as it remains sensitive to 3&#x02032;-AB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Although here the relative effect of 3&#x02032;-AB is similar to that of untreated controls, in absolute terms, a greater number of ends is prevented from joining after Ku knock-down due to the larger overall efficiency of the reaction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results confirm a dominant negative effect of Ku in cells with defective D-NHEJ, and suggest that Ku binding limits the recruitment of alternative pathways utilizing PARP-1.</p><p>The observed difference in the magnitude of inhibition by 3&#x02032;-AB or DIQ of IR-induced genomic DNA DSBs and of plasmid end joining in <italic>LIG4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells can be attributed to competition for PARP-1 between DSBs and other DNA lesions present in great excess in irradiated cells. To examine this possibility, we treated <italic>LIG4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (5 mM, 5 min, RT) just before plasmid transfection to measure end joining and the effect of PARP-1 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Untreated MEFs show the expected DNA end joining that is reduced by over 50% after treatment with either 3&#x02032;-AB or DIQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Notably, inhibition of PARP-1 by the same inhibitors is less effective after treatment of cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> suggesting a reduction in PARP-1 contribution, probably as a result of its engagement in the repair of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced DNA SSB and base damages in genomic DNA. Reduced effect of PARP-1 inhibitors is seen despite an overall increase in DNA end joining capacity in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This increase probably reflects the redistribution of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated cells throughout the cell cycle, and their accumulation in G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, the contribution of PARP-1 to DSB repair is compromised in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced SSBs and base damages suggesting that in irradiated cells, the same lesions will divert PARP-1 from DSBs. In the absence of DNA ligase IV, DNA ligase III is expected to carry out the end joining required to generate the signal detected here. This suggests that although PARP-1 participates in the reaction whenever available, it is not an absolute requirement for the reaction to take place.</p></sec><sec><title>Competition between PARP-1 and Ku for DNA end binding</title><p>We employed an EMSA to examine the DNA end binding properties of Ku and PARP-1 and to test competition between the two proteins for DNA ends. PARP-1 effectively binds a radioactively labeled double-stranded DNA substrate causing a mobility shift that is clearly detectable above 1 pmol protein (Supplementary Figure 3A). Because PARP-1 activity varies significantly depending on the type of DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), we examined three substrates carrying 4 nt 3&#x02032; overhangs, blunt ends, or 1 nt 3&#x02032; overhangs. Since similar efficiency for DNA end binding is observed with all substrates, further experiments are carried out using 4 nt 3&#x02032; overhangs (OA/OB).</p><p>OA/OB binds also avidly to Ku (Supplementary Figure 3A), generating a measurable shift at 0.2 pmol and complete shift at 0.5 pmol protein. Thus, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) Ku binds DNA ends with an approximately 10-fold higher affinity than PARP-1. Because the band generated by Ku has an electrophoretic mobility very similar to that of PARP-1, a comparison of the DNA end binding characteristics in the presence of both proteins is not directly possible. We exploited antibody mediated supershift to separate Ku and PARP-1 bands. An anti-Ku80 antibody causes a robust supershift that clears the region of the original main Ku band allowing thus parallel analysis of PARP-1 DNA-binding (Supplementary Figure 3B). From the bands generated by supershift, the lower one (Ku-S1) is thought to reflect loading of each DNA end with a single Ku molecule, whereas the upper one (Ku-S2) loading with two Ku molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). As expected, the mobility characteristics of PARP-1 are not affected by the anti-Ku antibody.</p><p>To examine competition between Ku and PARP-1, we first incubated substrate with Ku/antibody mixture and added subsequently PARP-1 at the indicated amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Ku at 0.2 pmol causes supershift for the majority of the substrate, mainly generating the band expected for single molecule loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Increasing amount of PARP-1 generates the expected band initially utilizing unbound substrate. At higher concentrations, however, the PARP-1 band is strengthened with parallel weakening of the Ku-S1 band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, PARP-1 displaces Ku from DNA ends, but a significant effect is observed at PARP-1/Ku molar ratios above ten. When the same assay is carried out with 0.5 pmol Ku (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), two prominent bands are generated by supershift (Ku-S1 and Ku-S2), but PARP-1 effectively competes for DNA ends mainly populated by a single Ku molecule (Ku-S1). The greater stability of Ku-S2 band suggests that after loading of multiple Ku molecules, cooperative binding stabilizes the structure. When the same experiment is carried out in inverse sequence of protein addition, Ku effectively displaces PARP-1 from DNA ends, with more than two thirds removed after addition of 0.5 pmol protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results are in line with previous observations in different model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>) and provide biochemical evidence for competition for DNA ends between PARP-1 and Ku, although successful displacement by PARP-1 requires concentrations higher by an order of magnitude than those of Ku. Such conditions may be approached after overexpression of PARP-1 DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Taken together the results presented identify PARP-1 as a component of an alternative pathway of NHEJ and provide evidence that DNA end binding, in direct competition with Ku, is a key determinant of pathway selection. Additional data provide biochemical evidence for an engagement of DNA ligase III, a known partner of PARP-1, in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). In a directly relevant biochemical study using a novel two-step <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA end joining assay, immune to interference by Ku, Audebert <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) reported that DNA end joining requires the synapsis activity of PARP-1 and the ligation activity of the XRCC1-DNA ligase III complex. Thus, the repair module PARP-1/DNA ligase III/XRCC1 (PLX), hitherto regarded as central in SSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>), is implicated in the repair of DSBs. This function may not rely on novel activities, as DSBs form when SSBs occur in close proximity, in opposite DNA strands. The much higher affinity of Ku for DNA ends will limit the contribution of this form of end joining to instances where the classical pathway is compromised. As a result, its function will be more that of a backup (B-NHEJ) and less of an &#x02018;alternative&#x02019; repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>).</p><p>Several reports implicate inferior backup pathways of DNA end joining in the phenotypes of mutants of the classical NHEJ pathway. Thus, non-classical pathways of end joining bring together the <italic>c-myc</italic> and <italic>Igh</italic> locus and cause B-cell lymphomas in mice with defects in <italic>Ku</italic>, <italic>LIG4</italic> or <italic>XRCC4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Functionally equivalent pathways may generate the aberrant junctions manifesting chromosome instability in the same mutants. Non-classical pathways of end joining generate the few V(D)J junctions observed in cells with defects in NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and are implicated in antibody class switching occurring under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Although not formally demonstrated, PARP-1 may be participating in these forms of non-classical end joining [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>)]. Furthermore, the substantial DNA end joining observed after exposure to IR of cells with defects in DNA ligase IV, Ku and DNA&#x02013;PK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and Supplementary Figure 1) directly implicates alternative forms of DNA end joining. The results presented here and published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) implicate PARP-1 and DNA Ligase III in this function.</p><p>PARP-1/DNA Ligase III dependent end joining, when utilized, helps the cell to restore its genome and thus presumably to avert cell death. However, its error prone nature causes genomic instability and cancer in the affected organism. The adverse consequences of this repair pathway may derive from inefficient synapsis of the DNA ends, which is probably supported only by microhomologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and is therefore inefficient and slow [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and Supplementary Figure 1; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>)]. The resulting persistence of DNA ends in the cell can lead to incorrect rejoining and thus to translocations. In addition, it may facilitate DNA end degradation and thus loss of genetic information. Both phenomena have been described in mutants of the classical pathway of DNA end joining (see above).</p><p>While prominent when the classical pathway is compromised, the backup pathway may theoretically be utilized to a limited degree in cells with functional D-NHEJ as well. This can occur when a DSB is induced in a nuclear region where Ku or other key components of D-NHEJ, are not immediately available; for example because they are already recruited to a neighboring DSB. Such contributions may underlie micronuclei observed in <italic>PARP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>), as well as genomic instability and occasionally tumor development in <italic>PARP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice on <italic>p53</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>).</p><p>Our results further show that the function of PARP-1 in DSB repair will be competed by its canonical function in SSB repair. Reduced engagement in the repair of a highly dangerous lesion as the DSB through competition by a less severe one, a SSB, is a limitation of the pathway and justifies its ranking as a backup. It follows that DSBs induced by agents generating higher ratios of DSBs to SSBs than IR, e.g. calicheamicin &#x003b3;<sup>?</sup>, are more likely to engage PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). However, this distinction of severity between SSBs and DSBs may be altered during S phase, where SSBs can be converted to one-ended DSBs which, if not repaired by HRR, can have serious consequences for the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of a PARP-1 dependent backup pathway of DSB end joining partly explains the lethality of <italic>PARP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>/<italic>Ku<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>), as normal development may not be compatible with inactivation of both NHEJ pathways. Along similar lines it can be reasoned that the lethality of <italic>PARP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>/<italic>ATM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice partly derives from a contribution of ATM to a subset of radiation-induced complex DSBs that require D-NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>). Also, tumor formation in <italic>PARP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice engineered with Ku haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>), or DNA&#x02013;PK knock out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>), suggests that reduction in the efficiency of D-NHEJ favors PARP-1 dependent end joining and thus genomic instability and cancer. Finally, the rescue of <italic>LIG4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> lethality and radiosensitivity by <italic>Ku</italic> knock out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>) can be explained by the relief of the dominant negative inhibition exerted by Ku on backup end joining in <italic>LIG4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells. However, the recent observation that PARP-1 protects HRR from interference by KU and DNA Ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>) also suggests that KU-mediated down regulation of HRR may partly underlie the above described phenomena. Finally, it is also possible that defects in SSB repair resulting from PARP-1 deficiency contribute to the described effects. More work is needed to discriminate between these possible contributions.</p><p>The biochemical properties of PARP-1 are compatible with its function in a backup pathway of NHEJ. PARP-1 binds and becomes activated by double-stranded DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>), even during V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>), as it would be anticipated by a protein involved in DSB repair. The affinity of PARP-1 for DNA ends generates an activity analogous to Ku and offers an alternative mode of recognition of this type of lesion. Although PARP-1 has been repeatedly implicated in DSB repair, divergent results have hampered the formulation of a consistent model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>). Our observations, as well as those published earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), implicate this activity in a backup rather in the canonical pathway of end joining and provide a new dimension for re-evaluating these experiments.</p><p>Although inhibition of PARP-1 compromises DSB rejoining both in the plasmid assay as well as in irradiated cells, the inhibition is never complete and actually rather limited for DSBs induced in genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). This suggests that rejoining of DSBs remains possible in the absence of PARP-1 and may be carried out by DNA ligase III, possibly aided by its zinc finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>The hierarchical organization of the classical and backup pathways of end joining may be regulated by interactions between the participating proteins. Thus, DNA&#x02013;PKcs is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated <italic>in vitro</italic> by PARP-1 and this modification stimulates DNA&#x02013;PK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>). On the other hand, DNA&#x02013;PK suppresses PARP-1 activity but probably not through the associated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). Similarly, the BRCT1 domain of XRCC1 is phosphorylated by DNA&#x02013;PK and this phosphorylation causes XRCC1 dimer dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>). At the same time, interaction between XRCC1 and DNA&#x02013;PK stimulates the kinase activity towards p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>). It is notable that all these inputs further consolidate the hierarchical organization of end joining by favoring the engagement of the classical pathway and suppressing the utilization of the backup pathway.</p><p>Our results in aggregate implicate PARP-1 in DSB repair through participation in a backup pathway together with DNA Ligase III and possibly XRCC1. This function is enabled by the considerable affinity of PARP-1 for double-stranded DNA ends, is under normal conditions competed by Ku and may further be down-regulated by DNA&#x02013;PK. Additional modulation of engagement for DSB repair is afforded by PARP-1 recruitment to SSB. Our experiments focus on PARP-1. However among the eighteen potential PARPs in the mammalian genome, PARP-2 has also been implicated in repair functions equivalent to those of PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). It remains to be seen whether PARP-2 can also contribute to backup end joining of DSBs as suggested here for PARP-1.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec>

The upper panel shows gels from a typical experiment and the lower panel the results of their quantitative analysis. Plotted is FDR, a measure of DNA DSBs present, as a function of the repair time. Shown are the means and standard errors calculated from four determinations in two experiments. The value of FDR measured in non-irradiated cells has been subtracted from the results shown. Standard lysis conditions were used in these experiments but similar results have been obtained with low temperature lysis.

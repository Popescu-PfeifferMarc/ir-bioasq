CpG ODN type D were shown to improve clinical outcome in rhesus macaques challenged with <italic>Leishmania major</italic>. These ODN have a self-complementary core sequence and a 3&#x02032; end poly(G) track that favors G-tetrad formation leading to multimerization. Although multimerization appears necessary for localization to early endosomes and signaling via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9), it can result in product polymorphisms, aggregation and precipitation, thereby hampering their clinical applications. This study shows that functionalizing the poly(G) track of D ODN with thermolytic 2-(<italic>N</italic>-formyl-<italic>N</italic>-methyl)aminoethyl (<italic>fma</italic>) phosphate/thiophosphate protecting groups (pro-D ODN) reduces G-tetrad formation in solution, while allowing tetrad formation inside the cell where the potassium concentration is higher. Temperature-dependent cleavage of the <italic>fma</italic> groups over time further promoted formation of stable G-tetrads. Peripheral blood cells internalized pro-D ODN efficiently, inducing high levels of IFN&#x003b1;, IL-6, IFN&#x003b3; and IP-10 and triggering dendritic cell maturation. Administration of pro-D35 to macaques challenged with <italic>L.major</italic> significantly increased the number of antigen-specific IFN&#x003b3;-secreting PBMC and reduced the severity of the skin lesions demonstrating immunoprotective activity of pro-D ODN <italic>in vivo</italic>. This technology fosters the development of more efficient immunotherapeutic oligonucleotide formulations for the treatment of allergies, cancer and infectious diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bacterial and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in specific sequence contexts (CpG ODN) trigger the vertebrate immune system through the activation of Toll-like receptor 9 [TLR-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)]. The resulting innate immune response limits the early spread of infectious organisms, while promoting the development of adaptive immunity. CpG ODN show promise as vaccine adjuvants and in the treatment of asthma, allergy, infection and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>).</p><p>Optimal sequences for the activation of TLR-9 vary among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Human and non-human primate TLR-9 respond to three types of synthetic CpG ODN: Type D (and A), type K [also referred to as B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>)] and type C, which have distinct structures and immunostimulatory activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides type D and A induce humanpDC to secrete high levels of IFN&#x003b1;, which in turn induces monocytes to mature into functionally active DC, and &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cells and natural killer cells to secrete IFN&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In contrast to K or C-type CpG ODN, D-type ODN do not induce pDC maturation, do not activate B cells directly and have reduced pro-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that administration of ODN type D, but not K or C ODN, improves the clinical outcome in health and immunocompromised non-human primates challenged with <italic>Leishmania major</italic> [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and D. Verthelyi, unpublished data].</p><p>Unlike K and C-type ODN, which have several CpG motifs and phosphorothioate backbones to increase resistance to nucleases, CpG ODN type D are characterized by having a core sequence with a single palindromic purine-pyrimidine-CpG-purine-pyrimidine motif flanked on both sides by 3&#x02013;5 self-complementary bases on a phosphorodiester backbone. Such a structure renders the sequence flexible allowing for the formation of a stem&#x02013;loop conformation and/or forming dimers with other D-type ODN molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In addition, D-type ODN have a 3&#x02032; end poly(G) motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), which is knownto self-associate via Hoogsteen base-pairing to form parallel quadruplex structures called G-tetrads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). CpG ODN type A have a similar general structure, but have poly(G) tracts on both the 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends and therefore can form parallel and anti-parallel quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>).Recent studies show that the formation of multimers is necessary for D-type ODN to localize to early transferring receptor positive endosomes to signal through TLR-9 and induce IFN&#x003b1;, and that monomeric sequences behave as competitive antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Indeed, disruption of the poly(G) motif by removing them or replacing one or more guanines with adenines or 7-deazaguanosines to impede tetrad formation abrogates the IFN&#x003b1;-inducing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). However, the poly(G) motif mediated formation of tetrads poses formidable challenges for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of CpG ODN type D, often leading to significant variations between lots and hindering the clinical development of these ODN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). To address this issue, we havedeveloped a pro-drug form of CpG ODN type D (Pro-D ODN) in which the backbone of the poly(G) track is functionalized with 2-(<italic>N</italic>-formyl-<italic>N</italic>-methyl)aminoethyl (<italic>fma</italic>) groups. The incorporation of these groups into ODN is achieved during solid-phase synthesis via phosphoramidites <bold>1a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>d</bold> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>)]. In this study we assess the structural and immunostimulatory characteristics of pro-D ODN and demonstrate that they have reduced G-tetrad formation and multimerization in solution but retain their <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> immunomodulatory activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligodeoxynucleotides</title><p>ODN D35, D144, D35 no-pal, DTP9, DTP10, K3, and K2007, were obtained from the FDA core facility.

The reaction time for each phosphoramidite coupling step was 180 s. The dedimethoxytritylation step of each chain-elongation cycle was carried out over a period of 60 s. A solution of 0.05 M 3<italic>H</italic>-1,2-benzodithiol-3-one 1,1-dioxide in MeCN was employed as an oxidant during the first two chain-elongation cycles. Each of these sulfuration steps was performed before the capping reaction step, and the reaction time for these steps was 120 and 60 s, respectively. By the third chain-elongation cycle, the sulfurizing reagent was replaced with the commercial oxidizing solution (0.02 M iodine in tetrahydrofuran/pyridine/water) and the capping step was carried out before oxidation over a period of 60 s. By the 18 chain-elongation cycle, the oxidant was replaced with the sulfurizing reagent; the oxidant line was cleaned thoroughly until it was iodine-free. Upon completion of the DNA chain assembly, the 5&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-DMTr group was left intact to facilitate purification of the ODN via reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in both &#x02018;trityl-on&#x02019; and &#x02018;trityl-off&#x02019; modes.</p><p>Solid-phase synthesis of ODN <italic>fma</italic>-D35 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) was prepared under conditions identical to those described above for the preparation of pro-D35 and pro-D144 ODN with the exception of using phosphoramidites <bold>1a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>d</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) exclusively.</p><p>Deprotection and purification of pro-D35, pro-D144 and <italic>fma</italic>-D35 ODN was carried out identically as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).

As reported previously for CpG ODN type A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) several bands were observed for D35 ODN, indicating that poly(G) bearing ODN exist as a mixture of monomeric, dimeric and multimeric structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The bands corresponding to the multimerized forms of D35 vanished when the sample was heated for 20 min at 96&#x000b0;C and immediately cooled on ice (data not shown). The self-complementary motif appears to be required for the formation of dimers as D35 no-pal showed bands corresponding to the monomer and high-order multimer, but not dimers. Despite having the same sequence as D35, pro-D35, similar to DTP9 which lacks the poly(G) tract, showed a major band corresponding to the dimeric form and a minor one corresponding to the monomeric form. The dimer band for pro-D35 exhibited a slower electrophoretic mobility and a lighter staining pattern when compared with the dimeric form of the parental D35, thereby reflecting reduction of the charge/mass ratio of pro-D35 ODN. The decreased multimerization of pro-D35 was confirmed by size exclusion HPLC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, pro-D35 and K ODN eluted as single peaks, whereas D35 showed additional peaks reflecting a mixture of monomeric and multimeric forms.</p><p>The 3&#x02032; poly(G) motif of D-type ODN is known to contribute to multimerization through formation of G-tetrad structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).

However, as shown by the CD spectrum of D35 no-pal, tetrad formation did not require the dimerization of the ODN through self-complementary far-flanking regions. This spectrum was different from the CD signature of K3 ODN or DTP9, which do not have poly(G) sequences, and showed a maximum and minimum ellipticity at &#x0223c;280 nm and &#x0223c;260 nm, respectively, a pattern associated with monomeric sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When recorded in the presence of 100 mM KCl (a potassium concentration similar to that of an intracellular milieu), the CD profile of either ODN was unchanged. In contrast, pro-D35 showed a CD profile similar to that of DTP9 in the absence of KCl (maximum ellipticity at &#x0223c;275 nm), but displayed one consistent with G-tetrad formation in the presence of KCl (100 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>A previous study had shown that <italic>fma</italic> thiophosphate or phosphate protecting groups are thermolytically cleaved off the ODN with a half time of 72 h or 56 h, respectively, at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Our own analysis of the impact of temperature on tetrad formation showed that D35 and K2007 ODN maintained their tertiary (tetrad/no tetrad) structure over time (data not shown). In contrast, the CD spectrum of pro-D35 ODN in the presence of potassium at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) showed a progressive increase in G-quadruplex signature over a period of 72 h suggesting that with time, the formation of G-tetrads is commensurate with the thermolytic conversion of pro-D35 to D35. Together these data strongly suggest that pro-D ODN do not form G-quadruplex structures in solutions low in potassium salt concentrations but can form G-tetrads inside the cell where the concentrations of potassium are higher. Further, the G-tetrads become more stable with time as the thermolytic moieties are cleaved.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular uptake and immunostimulatory properties of pro-D ODN</title><p>CpG ODN interact with TLR-9 within early endosomes; thus cellular uptake must occur prior to signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Although cellular uptake is CpG motif-independent, studies have shown that poly(G) motifs increase ODN internalization and alter their intracellular location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). It was therefore important to assert whether changing the ODN structure and the polarity of the poly(G) tract would interfere with cellular uptake. Binding and internalization of FITC-labeled ODN was assessed by flow cytometry as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Cellular binding of pro-D35 was 80.6 &#x000b1; 2.8% that of parental D35, but the change in polarity of the protected poly(G) sequence did not affect ODN internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, even when all the internucleotidic phosphate/thiophosphate linkages of D35 were protected with <italic>fma</italic> groups (<italic>fma</italic>-D35 ODN), there was no significant reduction in ODN internalization suggesting that cellular uptake of CpG ODN is independent of its polarity and of G-tetrad formation. Furthermore, PBMC stimulated with pro-D35 <italic>in vitro</italic> for 72 h induced secretion of IFN&#x003b1;, IL-6, IP-10 and IFN&#x003b3; to levels that were similar to those achieved with D35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>fma</italic>-D35, despite uptake, did not induce an increase in cytokine/chemokine levels (data not shown). Finally, pro-D35 was as effective as D35 in inducing monocytes to mature into myeloid DC after 48 h in culture, as inferred by expression of CD83, CD86, CD14, MHC II and CD40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and data not shown), whereas <italic>fma</italic>-D35 failed to drive DC maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies suggest that the differential effect of B (also called K) and D ODN is linked to the type of endosome they localize to and propose that ODN that form multimers are retained in the early and recycling endosomes while monomeric ODN are rapidly transferred to LAMP-1-positive late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Other studies suggest it is not size or the formation of multimers, but instead their ability to bind cells surface scavenger receptors such as CXCL16 what determines the type of signaling cascade that will ensue stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Regardless of the mechanism by which D ODN trigger TLR-9 in the early endosomes, the use of thermolytic <italic>fma</italic> groups to reduce tetrad formation by poly(G) bearing ODN did not significantly impact on the ODN's uptake or immunomodulatory activity. This suggests that the addition of formyl groups to the poly(G) strand does not alter the intracellular localization or the signaling cascade initiated by pro-D35. In contrast, placement of protective groups on the CpG motif prevents its immunomodulatory activity suggesting that they would interfere with the activation of TLR-9.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprotective effect of pro-D ODN</title><p>Asian rhesus macaques (<italic>M.mulata</italic>) have been used previously to assess the activity of CpG ODN in primates, as their immune cells respond to the same CpG ODN sequences as human PBMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Pro-D35 and D35 induced a significant increase in the number of cells secreting IFN&#x003b1; and IP-10 upon stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The immunoprotective activity of pro-D35 was then assessed <italic>in vivo</italic> in rhesus macaques challenged intradermally with 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> live <italic>L.major</italic> metacyclic promastigotes. This animal model of cutaneous leishmaniasis has been used previously to demonstrate the immunoprotective effect of CpG ODNs type D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Specifically, animals treated with D-type ODN, but not withCpG ODN type K or type C, developed significantly smaller lesions than untreated animals (D. Verthelyi, unpublished data). Twelve macaques (four/group) were treated, subcutaneously, in the inter-scapular space with D35 or pro-D35 ODN (0.5 mg/kg) 3 days before and after challenge or left untreated. These macaques developed a self-limited nodular skin lesion at the site of inoculation similar to those observed in human cutaneous leishmaniasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Animals treated with D35 or with pro-D35 ODN around infection time developed significantly smaller lesion size as compared with untreated ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The reduction in lesion size was associated with a significant increase in the number of antigen-specific cells secreting IFN&#x003b3; early in disease progression (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data demonstrate that pro-D ODN are active and effective <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, no losses of weight, lymphadenopaties, or other adverse events were observed during the study suggesting that these ODN do not induce overt adverse effects at therapeutic doses.</p><p>This report is the first to demonstrate the biological activity of a pro-drug form of CpG ODN type D developed by incorporating <italic>fma</italic> groups into the backbone of the 3&#x02032; poly(G) end (pro-D35 ODN). These protecting groups provided a transitory reduction of G-tetrad formation in potassium-free solutions, while allowing tetrad formation when potassium salt concentrations mimicked those of an intracellular environment (&#x0223c;100 mM). This modification did not significantly affect cellular uptake or biological activity, as shown by increased cytokine production and DC maturation, which were comparable to that effected by the parental D35 ODN. Finally, the clinical potential of pro-D35 ODN was demonstrated through the significant reduction of lesion severity in <italic>Leishmania</italic>-infected rhesus macaques. The current findings may have implications in other therapeutic oligonucleotides venues, such as in anti-sense and siRNA applications, especially when the administration of these ODNs as prodrugs may confer a therapeutic advantage.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr Joao Pedras-Vasconcelos and Dr David Davies for reviewing the manuscript.

The gel was electrophoresed at 250 V until the bromophenol blue marker (fastest moving band marked with black triangle) had traveled 20 cm, and was then stained with Stains-all. Electrophoretic mobility of monomeric ODN is indicated by a solid arrow, whereas the open arrow shows the mobility of ODN exhibiting secondary structures and/or self-complementary dimerization. Controls (not shown) included: boiled D 35 and K2007 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Note that ODN with 3&#x02032; poly(G) tracts (D35, D35 no-pal) have higher order structures that are absent when the poly(G) sequence is deleted (DTP9 and DTP10) or protected with <italic>fma</italic> groups (pro-D35). (<bold>B</bold>) Aggregate formation assessed by size-exclusion HPLC using a TSK-gel column. Solutions of D35, pro-D35 and K3 were prepared in 30 mM NaCl. (<bold>C</bold>) G-tetraplex formation monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in the presence and absence of KCl. The presence of G-tetrad is characterized by a maximal positive ellipticity at &#x0223c;265 nm and a minimal negative ellipticity near 240 nm (D35 ODN). CD units are in millidegrees. In the absence of G-tetrad (CpG ODN type K), the maximal positive and minimal negative ellipticities are shifted to &#x0223c;280 nm and &#x0223c;260 nm, respectively. Note that the CD spectrum of pro-D35 shows the absence of G-tetrad formation in the absence of potassium salt, whereas the signature of G-tetrad formation is detected in the presence of potassium salt.

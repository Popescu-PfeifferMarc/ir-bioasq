It nicks DNA at the second phosphodiester bond 3&#x02032; to a deaminated base or a mismatch. Endonuclease V obtained from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> preferentially cleaves purine mismatches in certain sequence context. Endonuclease V has been combined with a high-fidelity DNA ligase to develop an enzymatic method for mutation scanning. A biochemical screening of site-directed mutants identified mutants in motifs III and IV that altered the base preferences in mismatch cleavage. Most profoundly, a single alanine substitution at Y80 position switched the enzyme to essentially a C-specific mismatch endonuclease, which recognized and cleaved A/C, C/A, T/C, C/T and even the previously refractory C/C mismatches. Y80A can also detect the G13D mutation in K-<italic>ras</italic> oncogene, an A/C mismatch embedded in a G/C rich sequence context that was previously inaccessible using the wild-type endo V. This investigation offers insights on base recognition and active site organization. Protein engineering in endo V may translate into better tools in mutation recognition and cancer mutation scanning.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Techniques to scan unknown single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or point mutations are an essential tool in post-genomic era. Current mutation scanning methods include single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and heteroduplex analysis (HA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), and chemical or enzymatic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Several enzymatic cleavage methods have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). T4 endonuclease VII and T7 endonuclease I, the two phage resolvases, have been used for mutation scanning with limited success due to high background generated by cleavage of non-mismatch sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Other enzymes such as MutY DNA glycosylase and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), and CEL1 nuclease have also been employed in mutation scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>Endonuclease V (endo V) is a DNA repair enzyme with unique enzymatic properties. Under physiological conditions, endo V cleaves deaminated bases at the second phosphodiester bond 3&#x02032; downstream to a lesion. By shifting reaction conditions to higher pH, metal cofactor to Mn<sup>2+</sup>, using excess enzyme, and/or using solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and betaine, this repertoire may be extended to include cleavage of most mismatched DNA base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). This enzymatic property has been explored for the development of mutation scanning techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). We have devised a scheme that uses thermostable endo V obtained from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (Tma) to cleave mismatches and a high-fidelity thermostable DNA ligase from <italic>Thermus</italic> species AK16D to seal non-specific cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Co-incubation of the two enzymes allows for endonucleolytic cleavage of mismatches with real-time resealing of matched nicks, allowing for detection of low-abundance mutations in tumor tissue at a ratio of 1:50 mutant to wild-type DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>Tma endo V preferentially cleaves purine bases in a mismatch in certain sequence context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The wild-type enzyme cleaves the C-containing mismatches the least and C/C mismatches are essentially resistant to cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Even some A/C mismatches are refractory to cleavage when located in a G/C rich sequence context, as exemplified in the G13D mutation in K-<italic>ras</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Identification of endo V variants that can cleave C-containing mismatches will broaden the applicability of the endo V/ligase mutation scanning technique. Although an endo V&#x02013;DNA complex structure is not available, an extensive site-directed mutagenesis analysis has identified motifs and specific amino acid residues that influence base recognition and DNA&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Taking advantage of a battery of over 60 endo V single-site mutants previously isolated, we screened for and identified endo V variants that possessed altered base preference in mismatch cleavage. Y80A in motif III converted endo V to essentially a C-specific mismatch cleavage variant that was capable of nicking refractory A/C mismatches in the K-<italic>ras</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Purified deoxyribooligonucleotides were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc.

Proteinase K was inactivated by incubating at 80&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Amplicons containing wild-type sequence were added in approximately equal ratios when missing from the sample (i.e. pure mutant cell line DNA). The mixed PCR fragments, were heated at 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min to denature the DNA, and then cooled at 65&#x000b0;C for 15 min and at room temperature for 15 min to allow efficient formation of heteroduplex DNA.</p><p>To generate sticky ended PCR products, K-<italic>ras</italic> exon I was amplified as described with the exception that the PCR primers are as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>): Oligo 1, 5&#x02032;-CCCC<underline>GCTGAGG</underline>ATAGTGTATTAACCTTATGTGTGACATGTTC-3&#x02032; (underlined: N.BbvC IA site); Oligo 2, 5&#x02032;-FAM-CCCC<underline>CCTCAGC</underline>AAAATGGTCAGAGAAACCTTTATCTGTATC-3&#x02032; (underlined: N.BbvC IB site, which is complementary to the N.BbvC IA site).

Post-PCR processing and formation of duplex DNA were carried out as described above.

We screened a total of 64 mutants previously isolated for mismatch cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The assays were performed in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> instead of Mg<sup>2+</sup> since endo V enzymes show enhanced mismatch cleavage with Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). As expected, a majority of mutants lost mismatch cleavage activity. Other mutants still maintained mismatch cleavage activity in a pattern similar to the wild-type enzyme, which included G41V in motif II; Y80F, I81A, P82A, R88E, R88K and R88Q in motif III, R118A and H125A in motif IV; R205K, P207A, P209A, R211A, R211K and H214D in motif VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Yet, several mutants in motifs III and IV showed quite distinctively altered base preference in mismatch cleavage. An alanine substitution at Y80 position essentially switches the base preference from purine mismatches to C-specific mismatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). All five C-containing mismatches were cleaved by Y80A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, compare the band intensities in wild-type and Y80A). Most remarkably, even the refractory C/C mismatch in this sequence context was cleaved on both strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, C/C lane in Y80A). On the other hand, cleavage of other mismatches was minimum or not detected. A histidine substitution at Y80 rendered the enzyme more active in cleaving T-containing mismatches, while reducing the cleavage of other mismatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Y80H). Apparently, A86M preferentially cleaved A-containing mismatches (Figure 2, A86M). All four A-containing strands G/A, C/A, A/G and A/C and both strands in A/A were cleaved by A86M. Other mutants such as G83V and F87A also showed preference for A bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The base preference in R88E remained similar to the wild-type enzyme, i.e. G and A bases were preferred. However, the cleavage site on the top strand (blue band) is more promiscuous. Cleavage at 1 nt closer or 1 nt further away from the mismatches was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, R88E). Similar cleavage site promiscuity occurred in R88Q (data not shown). A few H116 mutants such as H116A, H116E and H116T somewhat preferred the A base in a mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Base preference of mismatch cleavage of Tma endonuclease V mutants.

Previously, we developed an enzymatic mutation scanning method, which takes advantage of the mismatch cleavage of endo V and nicking joining activity of DNA ligase to seal non-specific cleavage at matched bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). During the course of that study, we found G13D mutation in K-<italic>ras</italic> was completely refractory to endo V cleavage when using Mg<sup>2+</sup> as cofactor in the presence of both 5% (V/V) DMSO and 1.5 M betaine. G13D is a G to A transition that yields G/T and A/C mismatches. A closer look at the flanking sequence indicates that the mismatches are located in a G/C rich sequence context (TG<underline>G</underline>CG, the mutation site is underlined), which may make it difficult for endo V to cleave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). To test the ability of Y80A to cleave this sequence, we synthesized oligodeoxynucleotide substrate that was identical to the G13D sequence in K-<italic>ras</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, A/C). The overall design was consistent with the mismatch substrates used for initial activity screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When using Mn<sup>2+</sup> as the metal cofactor, the wild-type endo V exhibited non-specific fragmentation of both the top and the bottom strand as a result of non-specific cleavage, but did not yield correct length fragments from the mismatched base pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Remarkably, Y80A generated a cleavage band from the bottom C-containing strand at &#x0223c;38&#x02013;39mer position, indicating that the altered base preference has enabled the mutant to cleave the refractory sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To verify the specificity of the cleavage by Y80A, we synthesized a similar substrate but with the C base on the top strand, which would generate a 27mer if cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, C/A). Again, the Y80A cleaved the C-containing strand in the C/A mismatch at the anticipated position, while the wild-type enzyme generated lower molecular weight fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results confirmed the C base preference of the Y80A mutant in the refractory sequence.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Cleavage of A/C mismatch in synthetic K-<italic>ras</italic> G13D sequence by Y80A Tma endonuclease V mutant.

Heteroduplexes were generated by mixing the wild-type PCR amplicon with the mutant amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left). The 286 bp long heteroduplexes containing T/C and G/A mismatches from G12V and A/C and G/T mismatches from G13D were treated with Y80A mutant endo V. Since Y80A acted as a C-specific mismatch endonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), we scored the specific cleavage bands as resulting from cleaving C-containing mismatches. As expected, G12V was cleaved by Y80A on the C-containing strand to yield a 166mer product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left). However, cleavage of A/C mismatch in the G13D was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left). Previously, we have observed a reduction in fluorescence signal in blunt end amplicons due to cleavage of the fluorescent label and the adjacent base by endo V, liberating the label from the amplicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). We suspected similar cleavage event might have occurred in the blunt ended amplicons that have reduced the cleavage product signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> left, bottom of gel). Given that the synthetic duplexes contained overhangs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we thought the overhangs at the ends may reduce the loss of fluorescence signal by endo V. We, therefore, designed a method to convert the PCR amplicons to sticky ended duplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right). N.BbvC IA recognizes double-stranded 5&#x02032;-GC&#x02193;TGAGG-3&#x02032; sequence and nicks between the C and T. The recognition sequence was incorporated into the PCR primers for amplifying the exon I of K-<italic>ras</italic> gene (see Materials and Methods for details). The resulting PCR amplicons were then treated with N.BbvC IA to generate a two-base overhang at the 3&#x02032; end and five-base overhang at the 5&#x02032; end for the C-containing strand, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right). Both the G12V and G13D heteroduplexes were cleaved by Y80A mutant endo V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, middle). The non-specific products were sealed by the high-fidelity Tsp. AK16D ligase, thus reducing the background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right). Some of the mismatch cleavage products were also sealed by the DNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), resulting in a reduction in the intensity of the specific band.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Cleavage of A/C mismatch in K-<italic>ras</italic> G13D sequence amplified from colon cancer cell lines by Tma endo V mutant Y80A.

The ligation mixtures were incubated at 65&#x000b0;C for 20 min.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl916f4"/></fig><p>This work identified endo V variant enzymes with substantially altered base preferences in mismatch cleavage. Since all these variant enzymes contained changes in motifs III and IV, this underscores the important role these motifs play in base recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), Y80 and H116 appear to be important determinants of base recognition. Although an endo V&#x02013;DNA co-crystal structure is not available, secondary structure analysis indicates that both Y80 and H116 are located in loop regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). We speculate that motifs III and IV are components of recognition loops that are involved in specific base recognition.</p><p>Y80A is the most striking in that it essentially converts the enzyme to a C-specific mismatch endonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Consequently, the previous refractory C/C mismatch for the wild-type enzyme now becomes cleavable by the Y80A mutant. First, how does a single alanine substitution at Y80 position accomplish such a dramatic alteration in base preference? A simple model is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In the wild-type enzyme, Y80 imposes an unfavorable interaction with a C base, in which the amino group at C4 position spatially clashes with the bulky tyrosine residue. This steric hindrance prevents the wild-type endo V from recognizing and cleaving C-containing strand in a mismatch. By substituting the phenol side chain with a small methyl group, Y80A releases the steric tension and allows the C base to be accommodated in the recognition pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A comparison with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) is illuminating. The N204 in the recognition site of human UDG forms hydrogen bonds with O4 and N3 of uracil via the amide side chain and the Y147 excludes a thymine base by steric complementarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Interestingly, N204D confers cytosine DNA glycosylase to hUDG by forming hydrogen bonds with the C4-amino group and the N3-nitrogen via the carboxyl side chain, while Y147A switches the enzyme to TDG by preventing the steric clash with the C5-methyl group of the thymine base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). It is possible that endo V and UDG adopted a similar strategy as part of base-specific recognition mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>A hypothetical model for alteration of base recognition by Y80A. See text for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl916f5"/></fig><p>The surprising alteration in base preference of mismatch cleavage prompted us to investigate the potential implication in improving the endo V/ligase mutation scanning technique previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). The use of this technique in scanning K-<italic>ras</italic> mutations met with difficulty partly due to the inability of the wild-type endo V to cleave A/C mismatches in some G/C rich sequence context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Data presented here indicate that the Y80A is not only specific for C-containing mismatches, but also for those embedded in G/C rich environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, the C-specific mismatch cleavage ability may have enabled the Y80A to recognize and nick the C-strand previously not accessible by the wt endo V. Based on the model explained above, favorable interactions between Y80A and a C base may facilitate the base recognition process, which assists in guiding the complex to a catalytically competent path. Likewise, the previously inaccessible C/C mismatch now becomes a substrate for Y80A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The difference in A/C mismatch cleavage efficiency between amplicons with blunt or overhang ends is due to loss of fluorescence signal by endo V cleavage. This problem was previously addressed by synthesizing modified primers that are refractory to endo V cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Introducing a nicking site into a PCR primer provides a simple alternative method to maintain mismatch cleavage signal. This study demonstrates how malleable endo V is, allowing for alteration of base preference in mismatch cleavage by single amino acid changes. Some of these mutants offer the potential for developing base-specific endo V/DNA ligase mutation scanning assays.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Pu-Chun Ke for critically reading the manuscript and members of Cao and Barany labs for stimulating discussions.

In this database, each of the alternative splicing (AS) variants corresponds to a completely sequenced and carefully annotated human full-length cDNA, one of those collected for the H-Invitational human-transcriptome annotation meeting. H-DBAS contains 38&#x02009;664 representative alternative splicing variants (RASVs) in 11&#x02009;744 loci, in total. The data is retrievable by various features of AS, which were annotated according to manual annotations, such as by patterns of ASs, consequently invoked alternations in the encoded amino acids and affected protein motifs, GO terms, predicted subcellular localization signals and transmembrane domains. The database also records recently identified very complex patterns of AS, in which two distinct genes seemed to be bridged, nested or degenerated (multiple CDS): in all three cases, completely unrelated proteins are encoded by a single locus. By using AS Viewer, each AS event can be analyzed in the context of full-length cDNAs, enabling the user's empirical understanding of the relation between AS event and the consequent alternations in the encoded amino acid sequences together with various kinds of affected protein motifs. H-DBAS is accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jbirc.jbic.or.jp/h-dbas/"/>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Alternative splicing (AS) is a phenomenon in which various combinations of exons are integrated into different types of transcripts. By utilizing AS, diverse transcripts can be produced. Although it might not be always true that all the variants are translated, this mechanism at least enables a single locus to encode functionally divergent proteins. Actual abundant cases have been reported for such diversification of the gene functions mediated by AS, in which the binding site of a growth factor receptor or an activation site of transcription factor are modified. Especially in mammals, use of AS is widespread [it is reported that 40&#x02013;60% of entire human genes have AS variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>)] and is supposed to provide a molecular basis for highly fabricated systems, such as immune systems and neural networks.</p><p>Because of the growing interests in AS, a number of databases were launched, such as ASD [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/asd/"/>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)] and ASAP [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/ASAP/"/>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>)]. However, most of these preexisting AS databases are still incomplete in a sense that they are mainly based on the fragmented information of partially and imprecisely sequenced cDNAs (ESTs) or computationally divided information of the exons. In order to elucidate the functional relevance of the alternative variants to the protein functions, comprehensive information about the cDNA sequences is indispensable because sometimes protein motifs are embedded over a wide region of the protein sequences, and all of the combinations of the AS exons may not be allowed. Besides, for certain types of subcellular targeting signals, such as signal peptides, the position within the protein sequence is critical. Also, very recent reports, including ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), have demonstrated that many loci are subjected to complex patterns of AS in which two distinct genes seemed to be bridged (in which a variant uses exons from two adjacent loci), nested (in which a variant is located inside long intron of another locus) or degenerated (in which two variants use different reading frames in the shared exons. Its another name is multiple CDS): in all three cases, completely unrelated proteins are encoded by a single locus. These cases might not be regarded as alterative splicing in a strict sense. However, when those cases are also considered as extreme cases of functional diversification of a single locus and are subjected to be functional annotations, it is impossible to precisely characterize the combination of the exon usages.</p><p>Here, we introduce our new database of AS database, H-DBAS. We constructed this database exclusively using our unique dataset of completely sequenced and carefully annotated full-length cDNAs, which was produced by a human annotation meeting, H-Invitational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In H-Invitational, 56&#x02009;419 cDNA sequences of human genes, which were fully sequenced with a sequence reliability higher than 99% [Phred values greater than 30; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>)] and whose potentially problematic sequences such as vectors and polyA tails were precisely trimmed, were subjected to manual annotation of AS variants. These cDNAs were clustered into 24&#x02009;425 loci and of these, 6877 AS-containing loci, represented by 18&#x02009;297 AS variants, were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). As a specialized AS database, H-DBAS enables multifaceted analyses from various viewpoints, comprehensively aiming at elucidating functional consequences of widespread AS in human genes. [Note: We will use the word, &#x02018;locus&#x02019;, for the transcript cluster for the purpose of simplicity. However, the wording might be reconsidered, having observed highly diverse nature of the human transcriptome. Also see the reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>)].</p></sec><sec><title>DATABASE CONTENTS</title><sec><title>Data resources</title><p>In H-DBAS, the set of 167&#x02009;992 so-called H-Invitational cDNAs was used (available from the URL). In addition, an option in which ASs represented by 23&#x02009;210 RefSeq and 33&#x02009;411 Ensembl transcripts were also considered is also implemented. In total, 167 564 transcripts were presented in the context of corresponding human genomic information as of UCSC hg17 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#human"/>), cDNA information as of H-Invitational cDNA dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The mapping and clustering procedures for the cDNAs were followed the annotation pipelines of the H-Invitational cDNAs.

First, in order to remove possible 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032;-end-truncated cDNAs, we excluded cDNAs whose 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032;-ends were located inside the second or later exons of any other cDNAs with compatible exon structure in the same locus. We accepted the cDNAs whose 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032;-ends were located inside of the first/last exons and considered as variations in the exact transcriptional starting/terminating sites. We also assumed that those cDNAs whose 5&#x02032;-ends were located outside of the exonic regions of any other clones could not be truncated forms of any known types of transcripts, at least [for further detailed discussion of this subject, see reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>)]. Second, using the resulting filtered set of putative full-length cDNAs, the genomic position of each exon&#x02013;intron boundary was compared with those of the other transcripts belonging to the same locus. For the comparison, a 10 bp allowance was made. If a cDNA had a part of the exonic sequence in the first/last exon inside confirmed intronic regions of the other isoforms, it was regarded as being a &#x02018;5&#x02032;/3&#x02032;-end&#x02019; AS variant. If a cDNA had a part of an internal exonic sequence inside a confirmed intronic region of other isoforms, it was recognized as being an &#x02018;internal&#x02019; AS variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). At this point, we removed annotated genomic rearrangement genes such as Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) and anomalistic high polymorphic genes such as Major histocompatibility complex (MHC).</p></sec><sec><title>Merging alternative splicing patterns with functional annotations of the encoded proteins</title><p>Obtained information of patterns of AS was merged with that of detailed ORF prediction and functional annotation of H-Invitational cDNAs regarding protein motifs, GO terms, predicted subcellular localization signals and transmembrane domains.

In 14&#x02009;248 cases, different GO terms were assigned to different AS variants, thus, they could be considered as good targets for further analyzing functional diversification of the genes. Similarly, AS changing subcellular localization signals and transmembrane domains were identified in 17&#x02009;718 and 3995 AS variants in 5323 and 1248 loci, respectively. As for &#x02018;complex&#x02019; AS, 2336, 3629 and 258 AS variants in 472, 1223 and 101 loci were identified and registered in the database as bridged, nested and multiple CDS, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Numbers of the loci in which AS variants should influence the possible protein functions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#Locus</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#cDNA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AS affecting function total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7630</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24&#x02009;092</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;Motif-changed</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4624</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14&#x02009;550</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;GO-changed</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4150</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14&#x02009;248</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;Subcellular localization-changed</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5323</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17&#x02009;718</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;Transmembrane domain-changed</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1248</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3995</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Complex AS pattern total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1512</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5394</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;Bridged</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">472</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2336</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;Nested</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1223</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3629</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;Multiple CDS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">101</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">258</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><title>ACCESS TO DATABASE</title><sec><title>Search system</title><p>A simple search form in the top page allows the user to retrieve from within H-DBAS by inputting word(s) of selected categories such as Keyword, HIX (H-Invitational cluster ID), HIT (H-Invitational transcript ID), corresponding Accession/Refseq/Emsembl ID, HUGO gene symbol and definition. In the advanced search form, the user can search the database by more detailed features of AS. The advanced search form consists of three categories: (i) &#x02018;Genomic Location&#x02019; in which the user can specify in which chromosome and where in the chromosome the AS should be searched; (ii) &#x02018;AS Structure&#x02019; in which the user can look for the number of representative AS variants in the locus, particular patterns of AS (such as cassette, internal acceptor, internal donor, mutually exclusive and retained intron) and their locations (5&#x02032;/3&#x02032;-end and internal); (iii) &#x02018;AS Functional Annotation&#x02019; in which the user can specify the length difference of encoded protein, protein motifs, GO terms, predicted subcellular localization signals and transmembrane domains invoked by the AS: &#x02018;Complex&#x02019; AS patterns can be also specified here. It is possible to use any combinations of the above search conditions which are within the same or different categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For example, the users can perform the search by querying the AS, which should be located on &#x02018;chromosome 21&#x02019;, having &#x02018;internal&#x02019; &#x02018;cassette&#x02019; exons, affecting &#x02018;50&#x02013;100 amino acids&#x02019; and &#x02018;protein motif&#x02019;. When multiple entries are hit, the user can see the Result summary and select which should be further examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Text-based summarized information can be also selected instead of showing a Java-based dynamic user interface.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Search system of H-DBAS is shown. (<bold>A</bold>) Search form. H-DBAS has two sorts of search form named simple search and advanced search. The simple search allows the user to find AS locus by using keyword, H-Inv cluster ID (HIX), H-Inv transcript ID (HIT), accession number, RefSeq ID, Ensembl ID, HUGO gene symbol and definition. The advanced search allows the user to find AS locus by using various combinations of three categories such as Genomic location (i), AS structure (ii) and AS functional annotation (iii).

The browser can be zoomed from the genomic level to the sequence level (genomic/cDNA and amino acid sequences can be viewed). RefSeq and Ensembl transcripts can be viewed together with H-Invitational cDNAs as references. By using the clone view controller, the users can select which items should be viewed. Functional annotation view controllers can be used for selecting which protein motifs identified in the locus should be highlighted/erased. This page is designed so that the user can empirically recognize the positions and patterns of AS in the context of the full-length form of each transcript. It should be especially advantageous that the user can view possible influence of the AS on various kinds of protein motifs. When an AS exon in &#x02018;Exonic Segment&#x02019; window is clicked, the positions which are regarded as mutually AS are highlighted in &#x02018;AS Event View&#x02019; window. At the same time, if the protein motifs and transmembrane domains are identified, the corresponding exonic region of the cDNA(s) in &#x02018;Entry cDNA&#x02019; window is colored aqua on the ORF region colored pink.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>AS Viewer of H-DBAS is shown. Java applet for operating AS event and checking AS exon and protein functions such as protein motif and transmembrane domain. The user can also compare with representative AS variants (RASVs) by nucleic and amino acid sequence level. AS Viewer is separated following parts: (i) Definition and genomic information of the locus; (ii) Selection function and definition of RASVs including RefSeq and Ensembl transcripts as references; (iii) Selection function of protein motif and transmembrane domain; (iv) All exons of selected RASVs are located on genome and AS exons are colored red. By clicking an AS exon in Exonic Segment field, the AS events on the location are shown in AS Event Viewer. Max ORF means total ORF range on genome of selected RASVs; (v) Selection function of AS structure on genome and on cDNA. Selected RASVs' structures are shown and these ORFs are colored pink and protein motifs and transmembrane domains are colored aqua.

The lack of exons 2&#x02013;7 in the latter cDNA because of cassette type AS is responsible for this putative functional difference. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows an example from complex AS pattern.

We are also adding precisely annotated mouse full-length cDNA information as well and developing comparative genomics interfaces. The upcoming two major categories of extensive data will allow us to start determining how the ASs were acquired during evolution and how they fulfill the functional diversification of a single locus in various cellular circumstances. Furthermore, in the phase of further detailed experimental validation of the AS, H-DBAS should serve as an important interface for looking for cDNA clone resources, as the H-DBAS represents physical full-length cDNAs, which should serve as indispensable reagents for many kinds of experimental purposes.</p><p>Finally, we realize that we have a long way ahead for improving the web-page and database contents.

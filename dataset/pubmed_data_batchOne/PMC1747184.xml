It interacts ATP-dependently with the mismatch detector MutS&#x003b1; and assembles and controls further repair enzymes. We tested if the interaction of MutL&#x003b1; with DNA-bound MutS&#x003b1; is impaired by cancer-associated mutations in MLH1, and identified one mutation (Ala128Pro) which abolished interaction as well as mismatch repair activity. Further examinations revealed three more residues whose mutation interfered with interaction. Homology modelling of MLH1 showed that all residues clustered in a small accessible surface patch, suggesting that the major interaction interface of MutL&#x003b1; for MutS&#x003b1; is located on the edge of an extensive &#x003b2;-sheet that backs the MLH1 ATP binding pocket. Bioinformatic analysis confirmed that this patch corresponds to a conserved potential protein&#x02013;protein interaction interface which is present in both human MLH1 and its <italic>E.coli</italic> homologue MutL. MutL could be site-specifically crosslinked to MutS from this patch, confirming that the bacterial MutL&#x02013;MutS complex is established by the corresponding interface in MutL. This is the first study that identifies the conserved major MutL&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutS&#x003b1; interaction interface in MLH1 and demonstrates that mutations in this interface can affect interaction and mismatch repair, and thereby can also contribute to cancer development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The activity of the mismatch repair system elevates replication fidelity by several hundredfold through the removal of a wide variety of polymerase errors, including insertion&#x02013;deletion loops that can form during the replication of repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The system has been conserved throughout evolution. In humans, germline mutations in mismatch repair genes, predominantly <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>MSH2</italic>, underlie the Lynch syndrome (also called <italic>hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer</italic>, HNPCC), a hereditary cancer predisposition which accounts for 3-5% of all colorectal cancer cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>).</p><p>Mismatch repair in humans is initiated by one of two MutS heterodimers, either MutS&#x003b1; (MSH2&#x02013;MSH6) or MutS&#x003b2; (MSH2&#x02013;MSH3), depending on the type of mismatch to be repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). After mismatch binding by this heterodimer, a MutL heterodimer is recruited. This is predominantly MutL&#x003b1; (MLH1&#x02013;PMS2), although a contribution of MutL&#x003b3; (MLH1&#x02013;MLH3) has also recently been reported for a subset of replication errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The human MutS&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and MutL&#x003b1;/&#x003b3; heterodimers have evolved from the homodimeric bacterial predecessors MutS and MutL. The heterodimeric subunits of the human proteins share a common architecture, but diverge in structural and functional details.</p><p>Together with a MutS protein, the MutL protein directs the exonucleolytic degradation of a stretch of the error-containing strand including the mismatched base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Repair is completed by DNA re-synthesis on the emerging gap. The overall mechanism of mismatch repair appears to be similar in all organisms except for identification of the faulty DNA strand (that has to be repaired), which is performed in <italic>E.coli</italic> and some other bacteria by MutH, an endonuclease that binds in a site-directed manner to the transiently hemimethylated DNA that arises during bacterial replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Since eukaryotes lack this transient hemimethylation, other ways of strand discrimination are possible [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)].</p><p>While the role of MutS proteins as mismatch-detectors is well established, the contribution of MutL proteins to repair has remained more elusive. Recently, Modrich and co-workers have demonstrated an endonucleoylic activity of human MutL&#x003b1; residing in the C-terminal domain of PMS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Functionally, MutL proteins have been shown to confer termination of the exonucleolytic degradation of the faulty strand after removal of the mismatched base(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). One of their most striking features is that they interact with a wide variety of other proteins, including the endonuclease MutH, the DNA clamp &#x003b2; and DNA helicase II (UvrD) in bacterial systems, and the DNA clamp PCNA, topoisomerase II, and exonuclease I as well as several factors involved in DNA damage response in higher organisms [for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)]. They are therefore thought to act as matchmakers that assemble other enzymes to the mismatched site to accomplish repair and initiate DNA damage signalling. The most important protein interaction partners for MutL proteins, however, are the MutS proteins, since these two factors represent the core of the repair machinery.</p><p>The N-terminal domains (NTD) of MutL proteins contain an ATPase of the GHKL class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), while the C-terminus confers dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) and contains in the PMS2 protein the metal binding site essential for endonucleolytic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). The C-terminal dimerization is constitutive, but a second dimerization interface in the NTD of <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL has been shown to confer an ATP-dependent, reversible dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). This transient dimerization is required for ATP hydrolysis and represents a common theme among GHKL-ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The resulting ATPase cycle, which includes ATP binding, transient N-terminal dimerization, hydrolysis, subsequent separation of the N-termini and release of ADP, has been suggested to be a switch in the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), although its function is unknown. MutL has been found to bind DNA, and an association of DNA binding to the activity of the ATPase has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The ATPase, whose functionality is vital for repair activity in bacterial and human MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), likely controls binding (and activation) of the downstream repair factors MutL interacts with in dependence of the progression of repair.</p><p>The protein complex of MutS and MutL initiates and controls the mismatch repair reaction. Its detailed characterization is therefore essential for understanding mismatch repair. The conditions required for formation of complexes of MutL and MutS proteins have been investigated extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Their characterization is complicated by the transient and dynamic nature of the complex. We have previously shown that the N-terminus (residues 1&#x02013;505) of the MutL&#x003b1; subunit MLH1 is required and sufficient for interaction of human MutL&#x003b1; and MutS&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Based on the hypothesis that loss of MutL&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutS&#x003b1; interaction may interfere with DNA mismatch repair, we screened a set of cancer-associated missense mutations in MLH1 for their effect on interaction. We here describe the identification of a surface cluster of residues whose mutation disrupts MutL&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutS&#x003b1; interaction and affects mismatch repair activity, suggesting a mechanism by which hereditary mutations in this region can produce a cancer predisposition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, cell lines, plasmids, enzymes and reagents</title><p>Poly [d(I*C)] was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany), ATP, RNAse A and Proteinase K were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA).

Cells were harvested after 24 h and whole cell extracts were prepared. Cells were washed with PBS and re-suspended in 2 times the packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer (10 mMHEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT). The suspension was frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C and thawed on ice for lysis.

The suspension was rocked on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged (4&#x000b0;C, 21 000 g). The supernatant (whole cell extract) was stored in aliquots at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Expression of the desired protein was verified by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and immunoblotting in comparison to extracts of untransfected HEK293T cells (negative control) and extracts of 293 or TK6 cells (expressing wild-type levels of MMR-proteins) as positive control. Nuclear extracts for the interaction assay were prepared from HCT-116 cells as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear extracts for mismatch repair assays were prepared using a similar procedure.

Cell extract (150 &#x003bc;g protein, consisting of 145 &#x003bc;g HCT-116 extract and 5 &#x003bc;g extract of HEK293T cells containing the mutated MutL&#x003b1; protein) was incubated in 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT and 1 &#x003bc;g poly [d(I*C)] in a total volume of 300 &#x003bc;l for 5 min on ice. For each experiment, two identical samples from one master mix were prepared. Both samples were added to an aliquot of streptavidine beads coupled with 200 bp homoduplex DNA substrate as detailed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). After 20 min incubation, ATP was added to one sample to a final concentration of 250 &#x003bc;M. After 5 min, the beads were collected with a magnet and the supernatant was taken off, the cup centrifuged and residual supernatant removed. The beads were re-suspended in 20 &#x003bc;l elution buffer (700 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF and 0.5 mM DTT) and incubated for 5 min. The beads were collected and the supernatant stored for analysis. A second elution step was performed with 20 &#x003bc;l elution buffer as above, only with 1000 mM NaCl. This elution was also analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and immunoblotting and verified that ATP has taken effect, since it abolishes hMutS&#x003b1; signals in this elution fraction. Although this elution has always been performed as a control, the data has been omitted in the figures. Furthermore, identical concentration of the MutL&#x003b1; heterodimer has always been checked by an immunoblot of the incubation mixture.</p></sec><sec><title>Mismatch plasmid construction</title><p>The pUC19CPDC plasmid used for construction of the mismatched substrate were kindly provided by Dr John B.

In short, pUC19CPDC (50 &#x003bc;g) was nicked at two sites with 32 bp distance with N.BstNBI (usually 30 U) for 3 h. Quantitative nicking was assured by running aliquots of the reaction on an agarose gel, and digestion was continued afterwards with additional enzyme for one more hour. The digested single-stranded oligomer was released and captured by denaturing at 85&#x000b0;C for 5 min in the presence of 50-fold excess antisense-oligomer WHCPDPuriAS (5&#x02032;-GCGGATATTAATGTGACGGTAGCGAGTCGCTC-3&#x02032;) and subsequent slow cooling to room temperature. Oligomers were removed by centrifugation through Microcon-100 columns and extensive washing with TE buffer. Gapped plasmid was ligated with a 10-fold molar excess of WHpCPD7 (5&#x02032;-<italic>p</italic>GCGGATATTAATGTGACGGTAGCGAGTCGCTC-3&#x02032;). Ligation was carried out overnight with T4 DNA ligase (50 U) at 16&#x000b0;C. Ligated product was ethanol precipitated and subsequently treated with N.AlwI (50&#x02013;100 U) until quantitatively nicked as judged by electrophoresis of small aliquots. Enzyme was heat inactivated (80&#x000b0;C 20 min) and the nicked mismatch plasmid was purified by centrifugation through Microcon-100 columns. The resulting plasmid (named pUC19CPDC-GTN) contains one AseI restriction site, a GT mismatch within an overlapping AseI/EcoRV restriction site as well as a nick in the DNA 141 bp from the mismatched site, which serves to direct mismatch repair to convert the GT mismatch to AT, thereby restoring the AseI restriction site. Digestion of this preparation with AseI yielded only linearized vector, but no detectable fragments. Digestion with AseI and EcoRV showed that &#x0223c;10% of the preparation was cleavable with EcoRV, confirming that the majority of the original pUC19CPDC was transformed to mismatched substrate. Since repair of pUC19CPDC-GTN is assessed by restoration of the second AseI restriction site, the residual EcoRV-cleavable plasmid did not interfere with the mismatch repair assay. The presence of the mismatch and the nick were additionally verified by direct sequencing of pUC19CPDC-GTN.</p></sec><sec><title>MMR assay</title><p>Mismatch repair reactions were essentially performed as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).

Plasmids were extracted from the reaction mixture by phenol extraction and purified by ethanol co-precipitation with tRNA. Subsequent digestion with AseI and RNAse A produced two smaller fragments besides the linearized vector when repair was successful. Restriction digests were separated on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and documented by UV-transillumination and Polaroid photography.

We have previously shown that the interaction of MutL&#x003b1; with MutS&#x003b1; is predominantly conferred by MLH1, since the MLH1 subunit, but not the PMS2 subunit, interacts efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). This study also showed that an MLH1 fragment containing the N-terminal domains (NTD; MLH1<sub>1&#x02013;505</sub>) was required and sufficient for interaction. We therefore selected a set of Lynch syndrome mutations identified in the NTD of MLH1: Asn64Ser, Cys77Tyr, Thr117Met, Ala128Pro and Arg265Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, we included Asp132His, a mutation which has recently been associated with low-penetrance hereditary colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). Vectors containing the mutant MLH1 cDNAs were generated and transfected into HEK293T cells either alone or co-transfected with PMS2. The MLH1 gene is transcriptionally silenced in HEK293T cells, which causes a concomitant loss of PMS2, whose stability depends on MLH1 [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, WB, lane 1].

The expression levels of PMS2 were also similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, WB), which is consistent with our previous observation that the C-terminal domains of MLH1 suffice for stabilizing PMS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Accordingly, mutations in the N-terminus of MLH1 are unlikely to affect formation of a stable MutL&#x003b1; heterodimer, providing that the mutant MLH1 is stably expressed.</p><p>We tested the mismatch repair activity of all mutant proteins by assessing mismatch repair-mediated reconstitution of a plasmid restriction site containing a GT mismatch.

In this assay, DNA beads are incubated with nuclear protein extract containing the recombinant MutL&#x003b1; protein. Elution of DNA-bound protein and subsequent western analysis allows assessing binding of proteins to the DNA substrate. Under the conditions applied, MutS&#x003b1; binds to the DNA substrate, and MLH1/MutL&#x003b1; binds to MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA to form a ternary complex, which depends on MutS&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In this assay, addition of ATP triggers a characteristic, MutS&#x003b1;-dependent increase in binding of MutL&#x003b1; indicating the formation of the MutL&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). We have shown that the experimental conditions applied do not cause non-specific DNA end-binding of the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>), which has been suggested to impair experimental data on interaction. Since binding of MLH1/MutL&#x003b1; is MutS&#x003b1;-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and we did not detect any MutS&#x003b2; [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and unpublished observations], MutS&#x003b1; is the predominant factor in the MutS&#x02013;MutL&#x003b1; complex observed under these experimental conditions.</p><p>The interaction of three Lynch syndrome mutants (MLH1<sup>N64S</sup>, MLH1<sup>T117M</sup> and MLH1<sup>R265C</sup>) and of MLH1<sup>D132H</sup> with MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA was indistinguishable from wildtype (data not shown). In contrast, the MLH1<sup>A128P</sup> mutation significantly impaired interaction with MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>): although identical protein levels of wild-type and mutant MLH1 were incubated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel, &#x02018;Loaded&#x02019;), binding of the mutant MLH1<sup>A128P</sup> to MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA was suppressed below western blot detection limit, while wild-type MLH1 interacted efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right panel, &#x02018;Eluted from DNA&#x02019;). The corresponding experiment with the mutant heterodimer MutL&#x003b1;<sup>MLH1 A128P</sup> yielded very weak signals, whose quantification showed that its interaction was decreased almost fivefold in comparison to wild-type MutL&#x003b1;. The finding that the interaction of the mutant MLH1 subunit was more suppressed than that of the mutant MutL&#x003b1; heterodimer is in agreement with our previous observation that PMS2 can very weakly confer binding to MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). However, PMS2 was unable to compensate the loss of interaction conferred by the MLH1 mutation.</p><p>Various reasons can account for the loss of a protein interaction due to the mutation of a single residue, including loss of optimal <italic>van der Waals</italic> contacts and electrostatic interactions, but also more complex phenomena like conformational changes within the interaction interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). Since the introduction of the proline may cause structural distortions, we analyzed this region of MLH1 more closely to confirm its involvement in interaction with MutS&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of additional residues important in MutL&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutS&#x003b1; interaction</title><p>Ala128 is located within the conserved N-terminal ATPase domains of MLH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For selecting further residues for testing, we generated a local sequence alignment of MLH1 and PMS proteins around MLH1 Ala128 to search for patterns of conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), since protein&#x02013;protein interaction interfaces are more conserved than non-functional protein surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>). The sequence alignment shows two highly conserved motifs of the GHKL&#x02013;ATPase (motifs G2 and G3) which frame a less conserved stretch located between the two loops L34 and L56 (see annotations below the alignment). Ala128 is located within this less conserved stretch. To add more information on candidate residues for interaction, we generated an homology model of the NTD of MLH1 and performed ProMate and ConSurf predictions. ProMate performs structure-based predictions of protein&#x02013;protein interaction sites and was derived from an extensive analysis of transient heterodimeric protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). ConSurf calculates evolutionary sequence conservation scores and projects them onto the protein structure, thereby allowing analyzing surface conservation.</p><p>We tested ProMate on the known C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) of MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Although none of the probability values ProMate calculated were high enough to pass the algorithms' significance limit, ProMate correctly assigned the highest probability values to the experimentally verified C-terminal dimer interface (Supplementary Figure B). We therefore performed the prediction for the homology model of the NTD of MLH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and in parallel for the NTD of its <italic>E.coli</italic> homologue MutL, of which crystal structures are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). For both templates, ProMate identified two surface patches which showed increased probability to engage in a protein&#x02013;protein contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, left panels; marked by circles). Again, neither of these patches was above the significance limit and therefore required additional evidence (H. Neuvirth, personal communication).</p><p>The projection of the evolutionary conservation of MLH1 or MutL proteins on the surfaces revealed that the potential interaction patch close to MLH1<sup>A128</sup> also exhibits increased conservation scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, right panels; marked by circles), while no conservation is evident for the other region predicted by ProMate.</p><p>Taken together, the bioinformatic analyses suggested that MLH1 Ala128 is located closely to a surface patch showing both increased conservation and increased probability of engaging in a protein&#x02013;protein interaction. For further mutational analysis we therefore chose residues from this patch, but also included several residues from its surroundings constituted by &#x003b2;-strands 3&#x02013;5 of MLH1. We preferentially chose residues conserved exclusively in MLH1 proteins, since PMS2 contributed only weakly to the interaction of MutL&#x003b1; with MutS&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). We furthermore preferred surface placed, charged residues, since most protein interactions include electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>). We selected 14 residues from the top edge of the extensive &#x003b2;-sheet that backs the MLH1 ATPase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>). Furthermore, we tested mutations of two highly conserved residues (MLH1<sup>K164E</sup> and MLH1<sup>R182E</sup>) that have been reported to abolish DNA binding of bacterial MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>). DNA binding by MutL proteins is essential for repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>) and has been suggested to be important for their interaction with MutS proteins, since this requires DNA substrates of sufficient length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>).</p><p>Transfection of wild-type MLH1 and all mutant constructs into HEK293T cells resulted in similar levels of expression except for MLH1<sup>Y126A</sup> (data not shown), which was excluded from further analysis.

The repair efficiency of seven other mutants was reduced on average by 50%, while five mutations achieved close to 100% repair. Mutations that reduced mismatch repair levels affected residues with higher conservation than those that left repair efficiency largely unaffected (E71, D121, K123, K134). When more than one alteration of a residue was analyzed, the more conservative alteration affected repair less (Y130F, Y157A).</p><p>We identified three residues whose alteration interfered with the complex formation of MLH1/MutL&#x003b1; with MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA: His112 (MLH1<sup>H112A</sup> and MLH1<sup>H112D</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), Arg127 (MLH1<sup>R127E</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), as well as the non-conservative alterations of Tyr130 (MLH1<sup>Y130H</sup> and MLH1<sup>Y130A</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D&#x02013;E</xref>) displayed defects in binding to MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA. Identically to MLH1 A128P, these mutations decreased the level of bound MLH1 below western blot detection limit. The corresponding mutant MutL&#x003b1; proteins again retained some weak binding (also as observed with A128P), which was presumably conferred by PMS2. All other mutants, including the conservative alteration MLH1<sup>Y130F</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) interacted with MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA identically as wildtype (data not shown).</p><p>It has previously been shown that mutations in the ATPase domain can abolish hydrolytic activity of MutL&#x003b1; without affecting its ability to interact with MutS&#x003b1; (29). However, to rule out that an alteration of the ATPase activity may have indirectly abolished interaction, we tested the ATPase activity of the interaction-deficient H112 mutants.

After separation of the crosslinking products by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, Coomassie staining revealed the formation of two high molecular weight products: one which occurred in all experiments including MutL<sup>N131C</sup> and has previously been assigned as the MutL&#x02013;MutL (L&#x02013;L) crosslink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The other product formed exclusively in the presence of MutL<sup>N131C</sup>, MutS, ATP and DNA with an apparent molecular weight corresponding to a crosslinked MutL<sup>N131C</sup>&#x02013;MutS (S&#x02013;L) complex. The presence of both MutL and MutS proteins in this band was confirmed by tryptic digest and massspectrometry (data not shown). This suggests that Asn131 of MutL is close to one of the six cysteine residues in MutS.</p><p>In addition, we tested the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagent maleimido-benzophenone (MBP) that after coupling to a cysteine residue allows photocrosslinking to suitable acceptor residues in proximity to the benzophenone moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>). Again, a new band with low electrophoretic mobility was only observed in reactions containing MutS, MutL<sup>N131C</sup>, ATP and DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The lower mobility of the photocrosslink product compared to the cysteine&#x02013;cysteine-crosslinked product may be a result of crosslinking to a residue in MutS located in the middle of the protein rather than the end, a phenomenon which we observed for a variety of single-cysteine MutL variants (unpublished observations). The presence of the <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL interaction partner MutH, which physically interacts with the NTD of MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) did not affect formation of the MutS&#x02013;MutL<sup>N131C</sup> crosslink products, suggesting that MutH does not interfere with complex formation of MutL with MutS.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, information on MLH1 mutations in human cancer diseases, bioinformatic analyses and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays served to identify four residues in human MLH1 whose mutation interfered with the interaction of MutL&#x003b1; (MLH1&#x02013;PMS2) with MutS&#x003b1;. All mutations that abolished interaction also disabled the mismatch repair activity of MutL&#x003b1;. Therefore, we provided experimental evidence that the MutL&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutS&#x003b1; interaction is required for mismatch repair.</p><p>In the present experiments, the investigated mutations could in principle have affected the MutL&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutS&#x003b1; interaction in three ways: (i) the mutation could directly abolish the interaction interface; (ii) the mutation could confer an indirect effect on interaction by affecting the ATPase activity of MLH1; (iii) the mutation could abolish interaction with another protein that mediates the MutL&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutS&#x003b1; complex, since nuclear extracts were used. However, it is most likely that the analyzed mutants affected the interaction interface directly for the following reasons: (i) the data from the mutational analysis is consistent with bioinformatic evidence indicating a conserved protein&#x02013;protein interaction site in the investigated position; (ii) the crosslinking experiments with the homologue MutL reflected a direct physical contact; (iii) the interaction-deficient mutant MutL&#x003b1;<sup>MLH1 H112D</sup> had wild-type ATPase activity; (iv) the applied method efficiently captures complexes of purified MutL&#x003b1; and MutS&#x003b1; (28), excluding a prominent involvement of a mediator protein.</p><p>Two of the identified mutations affected charged surface residues (His112 and Arg127). The positive charge of His112 is very conserved in eukaryotic MLH1 (either His, Arg or Lys) and bacterial MutL (exclusively Arg), while this position is variable in PMS proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that the positive charge in this position is vital for a functional interaction of MLH1 with MutS&#x003b1;. The other charged surface residue, Arg127, also shows very high conservation of the positive charge, but this is also true for PMS proteins, while MutL proteins have glutamine in this position. Two further mutations affected buried residues (Ala128 and Tyr130). The Ala128Pro mutation most likely disrupts the &#x003b2;-strand &#x003b2;4 and thereby distorts the &#x003b2;-sheet. In the position of Tyr130, bulky hydrophobic residues are conserved, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions of this residue contribute to the structural integrity of this protein region. Accordingly, the conservative alteration of Tyr130 to phenylalanine (MLH1<sup>Y130F</sup>) impaired neither interaction nor mismatch repair. All three mutations (Ala128Pro, Tyr130His/Ala) therefore seem incompatible with maintaining the structural integrity of the interaction interface.</p><p>All identified residues cluster in a small region of MLH1, suggesting that the major MutL&#x003b1; interaction interface for MutS&#x003b1; is (at least partly) constituted by residues from two adjacent &#x003b2;-strands (&#x003b2;3&#x02013;&#x003b2;4) on the edge of an extensive &#x003b2;-sheet that backs the ATP binding pocket of MLH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL could be site-specifically crosslinked to MutS from a residue in the corresponding area, suggesting that MutL interacts with MutS with the same site. This is corroborated by the bioinformatic evidence, which suggested a similarly placed putative protein interaction site for MutL as for MLH1.</p><p>The interaction interface is easily accessible even when the N-terminal ATPase domains of MutL&#x003b1; dimerize similarly as has been described for <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The contact of MLH1 to MutS&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA could therefore in principle be maintained by any intermediate of the ATPase cycle of MutL proteins, which involves this transient N-terminal dimerization. Since the interaction interface is located in immediate proximity to the MLH1 ATPase, interaction is very likely to modulate its activity. It will be interesting to investigate the nature of this modulation, since this may help disclose how mismatch recognition and repair are communicated from MutS to MutL and then to the downstream enzymes of mismatch repair. The presently identified mutations may facilitate such investigations, since they allow selectively disabling MutL&#x02013;MutS complex formation.</p><p>During evolution, the homodimeric bacterial MutS and MutL proteins have changed to the heterodimeric complexes that are present in eukaryotic organisms. This process involved a specialization of the dimeric subunits as is exemplified by the finding that only one subunit of the eukaryotic MutS&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimers (MSH3/6) has retained the residues required for mismatch recognition, while these residues have been lost in their MSH2 partner. Our previous work already suggested that the interaction of two different human MutL heterodimers (MutL&#x003b1;, MLH1&#x02013;PMS2, and MutL&#x003b2;, MLH1&#x02013;PMS1) with MutS&#x003b1; depends predominantly on their MLH1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). The present findings confirm that mutations in the NTD of MLH1 suffice to abolish interaction of MutL&#x003b1; with MutS&#x003b1;. This confirms the significance of MLH1 over its PMS partners in MutL&#x02013;MutS interactions and suggests that MLH1 may have specialized to a general interaction adaptor responsible for docking human MutL heterodimers to their MutS partners, while the PMS family of proteins has (mostly) lost this ability.</p><p>The present study revealed that the cancer-associated mutation MLH1<sup>A128P</sup> affects a residue located within the MutL&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutS&#x003b1; interaction interface. This mutation disabled <italic>in vitro</italic> mismatch repair by destroying the ability of MutL&#x003b1; to interact with MutS&#x003b1; (although other functions of MLH1 may also be affected by the mutation). The MLH1<sup>A128P</sup> mutation has been identified in an Italian kindred with a classical Lynch syndrome meeting the clinical Amsterdam criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>). In the affected family, several members suffered from cancer occurring at young age. The present findings are in good agreement with the severe clinical phenotype.</p><p>A second cancer-associated mutation, MLH1<sup>D132H</sup>, affects a residue located very closely to the interaction interface, but the mutation did not detectably affect DNA mismatch repair or MutS&#x003b1; interaction in our experiments. The MLH1<sup>D132H</sup> mutation is extraordinary since the cancer predisposition it confers is untypical for Lynch syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). Tumours of affected individuals rarely showed microsatellite instability (MSI), which is a genetic hallmark of deficient mismatch repair and typically observed in Lynch syndrome tumours. The mean age of cancer onset was significantly higher and the penetrance within the family appeared lower than in Lynch syndrome. Our finding that DNA mismatch repair was not detectably impaired by this mutation explains the rare occurrence of tumour MSI and the attenuated phenotype. Further studies will have to clarify if the low-penetrance cancer predisposition of this mutation is the result of a DNA mismatch repair defect that is too weak to be detectable by the applied <italic>in vitro</italic> mismatch repair assay or the mutation affects another function of MLH1.</p><p>In conclusion, our work identifies the interaction interface of MutL&#x003b1; for MutS&#x003b1; within MLH1. This interaction interface is also conserved in bacterial MutL proteins. Mutations in this interface in MLH1 suffice to abolish interaction of the MutL&#x003b1; heterodimer with MutS&#x003b1; and result in a MutL&#x003b1; heterodimer deficient for mismatch repair. One cancer-associated mutation which is located within this interaction interface abolishes interaction and repair, underlining the importance of this complex for mutation avoidance.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec>

(<bold>A</bold>) The table lists the six MLH1 missense mutations identified in hereditary human cancer syndromes which were selected for analysis. Five of these mutations have been described in patients with the Lynch cancer syndrome, while one (D132H) has recently been reported to underlie a low-penetrance colorectal cancer syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). <sup>*</sup>The Reported cases column contains the number of individual reports listed by the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.insight-group.org"/>) except for <sup>**</sup>D132H whose allele frequency has been determined in the Israelic population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) Wild-type MLH1 and the cancer-associated MLH1 mutants were co-expressed with PMS2 in HEK293T cells. Protein extracts (50 &#x003bc;g) of untransfected (lane 1) and transfected (lanes 2&#x02013;7) cells were separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and protein expression was verified by immunoblotting (MLH1<sup>trans.</sup> and PMS2<sup>trans.</sup>, WB, top panel). Endogenous MSH2 (MSH2<sup>endog.</sup>) served as loading control (WB, bottom panel). The extracts were incubated with a mismatched plasmid as detailed in Materials and Methods. The plasmid contained a restriction site blocked by a G&#x02013;T mismatch. Reconstitution of this restriction site by mismatch repair yielded two plasmid fragments (D) besides linearized vector (L) after separation of the digestion products in agarose gels. Repair activity of the MutL&#x003b1; mutants was assessed in direct comparison to wild-type MutL&#x003b1; which was expressed, processed and analyzed in parallel. Repair levels were quantified relative to wildtype; n.d., no detectable repair activity. (<bold>C</bold>) A DNA pull-down assay was performed to assess interaction of MLH1<sub>wt</sub> and MLH1<sup>A128P</sup> with MutS&#x003b1;-DNA. Both MLH1 proteins were expressed either alone (top panels) or co-expressed with wild-type PMS2 to form the heterodimer MutL&#x003b1; (bottom panels) in HEK293T cells. Equal amounts of protein extract were incubated with DNA-coupled magnetic beads as detailed in Materials and Methods. From these incubations, equal aliquots were removed, separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and checked by immunoblotting to contain identical concentrations of transfected MLH1 (and PMS2, if applicable) as shown in the left panel (&#x02018;Loaded&#x02019;). MSH2 was detected in parallel to serve as loading control. Each incubation was divided in two samples, one of which (&#x02018;+&#x02019;) was supplemented with ATP (250 &#x003bc;M final concentration). Supernatant was removed and bound proteins were eluted, separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and detected by immunoblotting (right panels, &#x02018;Eluted from DNA&#x02019;). MutS&#x003b1; (only MSH2 is shown) and MutL&#x003b1; (MLH1&#x02013;PMS2) were detected. PMS2 is visible just above the signal of MSH2.

(<bold>C</bold>) A homology model of the N-terminal domains of MLH1 (residues 1&#x02013;335) was generated (for details see Materials and Methods) and used for interaction-site prediction with ProMate (left) and projection of phylogenetic conservation with ConSurf (right) as detailed in Materials and Methods. ProMate enabled shading of the surface of the model according to the predicted probability of the residues to contribute to a transient protein&#x02013;protein interaction, with <italic>red shading</italic> representing high probability and <italic>blue shading</italic> showing low probability. The ConSurf prediction is presented with <italic>red shading</italic> for conserved residues and <italic>blue shading</italic> for variable residues.

Residues whose mutation interfered with MutL&#x003b1;&#x02013;MutS&#x003b1; interaction (presented in spheres) are clustered on the top edge of this &#x003b2;-sheet of the MLH1 subunit. (<bold>B</bold>) Surface presentation of A. Buried or surface residues whose mutation abolished interaction are coloured red and orange, respectively. The MLH1 residue homologous to MutL<sup>N131</sup> which has been crosslinked to MutS is coloured dark blue, while other investigated residues without detectable effect on interaction are coloured cyan. The region that the ProMate and ConSurf analyses suggested as interaction interface (Figure 2C) is marked by a white line.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl944f5"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summarized features of MLH1 mutations screened in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Residue</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alteration</th><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Localization<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">a</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conservation<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-2">b</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asn 64</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ser</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">c</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glu 71</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lys</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">mc</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asp 72</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lys</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">c</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">His 112</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asp, Ala</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003b2;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">c (in MLH1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Thr 117</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Met</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003b2;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bur.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">c</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lys 118</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glu</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003b2;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">mc (in MLH1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asp 121</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">His</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lys 123</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glu</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tyr 126</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ala</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003b2;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bur.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">c (in MLH1;

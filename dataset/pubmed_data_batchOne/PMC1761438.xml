Investigations of transcriptional responses to the modulation of gyrase function have identified two types of topoisomerase-mediated transcriptional responses: (i) steady-state changes elicited by a mutation in gyrase, such as the D82G mutation in GyrA, and (ii) dynamic changes elicited by the inhibition of gyrase. We hypothesize that the steady-state effects are due to the changes in biochemical properties of gyrase, whereas the dynamic effects are due to an imbalance between supercoiling and relaxation activities, which appears to be influenced by the RecA activity. Herein, we present biochemical evidence for hypothesized mechanisms. GyrA D82G gyrase exhibits a reduced supercoiling activity. The RecA protein can influence the balance between supercoiling and relaxation activities either by interfering with the activity of DNA gyrase or by facilitating the relaxation reaction. RecA has no effect on the supercoiling activity of gyrase but stimulates the relaxation activity of topoisomerase I. This stimulation is specific and requires formation of an active RecA filament. These results suggest that the functional interaction between RecA and topoisomerase I is responsible for RecA-mediated modulation of the relaxation-dependent transcriptional activity of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> chromosome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In prokaryotes, DNA is maintained in negatively supercoiled state, which is essential for various cellular processes. DNA topoisomerases are responsible for controlling the superhelicity of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Thus, topoisomerases play critical roles in many aspects of DNA transaction, as well as in the maintenance of chromosome structure. There are four topoisomerases in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Topoisomerase I (Topo I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and topoisomerase III (Topo III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) are type IA enzymes; DNA gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) and topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) are type IIA enzymes.</p><p>Type IA enzymes are monomeric proteins that can relax negative supercoils, and catenate and decatenate nicked or gapped, double-stranded circular DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). These enzymes require a single-stranded region to bind to DNA. <italic>E.coli</italic> Topo I is the prototype of type IA protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The N-terminal 582 amino acid residues correspond to the catalytic domain containing the active site Tyr at position 319. The catalytic domain is followed by a non-homologous carboxyl-terminal domain. The non-homologous carboxyl-terminal domains are involved in determining the distinct substrate specificities and catalytic properties of these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Type IIA topoisomerases alter the linking number in steps of two by breaking both strands, passing another segment of the helix through the break and then resealing the broken strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). DNA gyrase and Topo IV consist of GyrA and GyrB subunits and ParC and ParE subunits, respectively. GyrA and ParC subunits catalyze strand-breakage and reunion reactions, whereas GyrB and ParE subunits hydrolyze ATP. The active forms of gyrase and Topo IV are an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> tetramer; these topoisomerases bind double-stranded DNA. Despite the high degree of similarity between gyrase and Topo IV, these two enzymes display distinct cellular functions. Gyrase is the only topoisomerase that introduces negative supercoils into DNA, whereas Topo IV is responsible for decatenation of replicating DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p><italic>E.coli</italic> RecA has DNA-dependent ATPase activity and ATP-dependent DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). RecA proteins from various bacteria are highly conserved and homologues have been identified in eukaryotes as well. RecA catalyzes strand-exchange reactions and thus plays a central role in the homologous recombination process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In addition, RecA, when activated, causes proteolytic cleavage of the LexA repressor to trigger the induction of the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). RecA is also required for mutagenic lesion bypass synthesis during the SOS response and is involved in replication restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). RecA monomers polymerize on DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. RecA can bind to and form a nucleoprotein filament on either single- or double-stranded DNA, although nucleation on single-stranded DNA is much faster than that on double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Both assembly and disassembly of RecA filaments take place in the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In the presence of ATP, dATP or an ATP analogue, such as ATP&#x003b3;S, RecA forms an &#x02018;active&#x02019; filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The active RecA filament is a right-handed helical filament with six RecA monomers per turn and 3 nt per RecA monomer. When it is formed on double-stranded DNA, the DNA is underwound relative to the B-form helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). In contrast, RecA forms an &#x02018;inactive&#x02019; filament in the absence of cofactor or presence of ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>The ability of DNA microarrays to monitor transcriptional activity of entire genomes has allowed an assessment of transcriptional and replication states of the <italic>E.coli</italic> chromosome following inhibition of DNA gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). These studies confirmed that treating cells with norfloxacin, a fluoroquinolone inhibitor of gyrase, affects transcription of a largenumber of genes in the genome. Quinolone treatment also causes the replication fork arrest and generation of double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). A systematic analysis of transcriptional effects would not be possible, however, without accounting for a various cellular responses, such as the SOS response, DNA relaxation and replication inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). We modeled transcriptional responses to the quinolone-induced inhibition of gyrase in <italic>E.coli</italic> as a function of the downstream processes, including DNA repair, supercoiling and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). We found that relaxation by Topo I was the dominant factor behind the transcriptional response followed by the effects of DNA replication and RecA. We also found the correlation between the effect of relaxation and that of RecA.</p><p>Decrease in the extent of negative supercoiling of the chromosomal DNA is accompanied by characteristic changes in gene expression, exemplified by a compensatory upregulation of the <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and downregulation of the <italic>topA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). We observed such characteristic changes under two conditions: steady-state changes during the normal exponential growth of a strain carrying the D82G mutation in the <italic>gyrA</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) and dynamic changes following the inhibition of DNA gyrase with a quinolone drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Despite the differences between the two conditions: one representing normal growth, another&#x02014;cell killing, transcriptional states of the cells were strikingly similar. Depending on growth medium, we found that the overlap between significantly differentially expressed genes in those conditions is 15&#x02013;25%, and the probability of such an overlap occurring by chance is less than one in a million. We hypothesized that the steady-state effects were due to the changes in biochemical properties of the gyrase enzyme itself, while the dynamic effects were largely due the imbalance between supercoiling and relaxation activities in the cell. Interestingly, the imbalance between supercoiling and relaxation activities appeared to be modulated by the RecA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we conducted biochemical studies to determine the molecular basis of two types of topoisomerase-mediated genomewide transcriptional responses, as well as the effect of RecA on the balance between supercoiling and relaxation activities. We found that GyrA D82G gyrase exhibited a reduced activity to catalyze the supercoiling reaction and support DNA replication. We also found that RecA was capable of stimulating Topo I-catalyzed relaxation reaction. The stimulatory effect of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecA was specific to <italic>E.coli</italic> Topo I and required the formation of an active RecA filament. Thus, the functional interaction between RecA and Topo I is likely to be responsible for the RecA-mediated modulation of transcriptional responses in quinolone treated <italic>E.coli</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNAs and proteins</title><p>The <italic>recA</italic> gene was generated by PCR using <italic>E.coli</italic> MG1655 genomic DNA as a template and cloned into the pET-11c vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).

To examine our hypothesis that the steady-state effects are due to the changes in biochemical properties of gyrase, we determined the biochemical properties of GyrA D82G gyrase. First, the effect of the D82G mutation on the supercoiling activity of gyrase was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Based on the amounts of form I DNA produced under these conditions, the supercoiling activity of GyrA D82G gyrase was 2&#x02013;3 fold lower than that of the wild-type gyrase. In contrast, the S83W mutation, a commonly found quinolone resistance-conferring mutation at the conserved Ser in the GyrA subunit, did not affect the supercoiling activity of gyrase. In fact, the specific activity of GyrA S83W gyrase was slightly higher (2-fold or less) than that of the wild-type gyrase. We also measured the quinolone sensitivity of GyrA D82G gyrase in the supercoiling assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The D82G mutation conferred a low level of quinolone resistance to gyrase, whereas the S83W mutation conferred a high level of quinolone resistance to gyrase.

We conducted biochemical studies and provided evidence for these hypothesized mechanisms.</p><p>The D82G mutation in the GyrA subunit was selected by the screening of mutations, which increased levels of the <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic> transcripts in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). This mutation has been previously identified as a part of a double mutation in the <italic>E.coli gyrA</italic> gene that confers quinolone resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). As expected, GyrA D82G gyrase exhibited a low level of resistance to norfloxacin, a quinolone drug, in the supercoiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and DNA cleavage (data not shown) assays. This mutation does not affect the growth rate in rich medium but alters the steady-state transcriptional activity of more than 800 genes in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). We found that GyrA D82G gyrase had a reduced activity (2&#x02013;3 fold lower than the wild-type enzyme) to catalyze the supercoiling reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and support <italic>oriC</italic> DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the steady-state changes in the genomewide gene expression elicited by the D82G mutation in the GyrA subunit is due to its effect on the catalytic activity of DNA gyrase. The previous observation that small changes in the supercoiling activity of gyrase have widespread effects on the relative abundance of 88 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>) supports our conclusion.</p><p>Our investigation on transcriptional responses to the inhibition of DNA gyrase in <italic>E.coli</italic> revealed that the average kinetics of transcriptional responses triggered by the quinolone treatment was affected in a RecA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). The RecA protein could modulate the balance between supercoiling and relaxation activities either by interfering with the supercoiling activity of gyrase or by facilitating the relaxation activity of Topo I. To determine the molecular basis of the effect of RecA on the balance of supercoiling and relaxation activities in the cell, we assessed the effects of RecA on gyrase-catalyzed supercoiling reaction and Topo I-catalyzed relaxation reaction <italic>in vitro</italic>. The presence of RecA did not affect the supercoiling activity of gyrase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, no effect of RecA on either the decatenation or relaxation activity of Topo IV was detected (data not shown). Thus, RecA does not affect the catalytic activities of bacterial type IIA topoisomerases.</p><p>RecA was capable of stimulating the relaxation activity of Topo I <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The stimulation of Topo I-catalyzed relaxation reaction by RecA required formation of an active RecA filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is likely that RecA-mediated stimulation of Topo I activity accounts for the effect of a <italic>recA</italic> mutation on the balance between supercoiling and relaxation activities in <italic>E.coli</italic>. Topo I, in the presence of RecA, can relax the chromosomal DNA at its maximum rate upon the inhibition of gyrase in the wild-type strain, whereas, due to the loss of the stimulatory effect of RecA on Topo I, the relaxation of the chromosome is significantly slower in a <italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain. A strong correlation between changes in transcript levels of a group of genes in a <italic>recA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain and those in a <italic>topA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) also supports the conclusion that the functional interaction between RecA and Topo I is responsible for RecA-mediated modulation of the balance between supercoiling and relaxation activities <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>What is the mechanism of the functional interaction between <italic>E.coli</italic> RecA and <italic>E.coli</italic> Topo I? One possibility is that the formation of an active RecA filament could alter the conformation of the DNA and generate single-stranded regions to provide binding sites for Topo I. An alternative possibility is that RecA might physically interact with Topo I and recruit Topo I to the DNA. It seemed more likely that RecA could stimulate Topo I by changing the conformation of DNA and generating single-stranded regions. In this case, it was reasonable to assume that RecA could have a general stimulatory effect on the activities of various type IA topoisomerases, which require a single-stranded region to bind to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). We found, however, that the stimulatory effect of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecA was somewhat specific to <italic>E.coli</italic> Topo I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, conformational change of the DNA substrate alone may not explain the stimulation of the relaxation activity of <italic>E.coli</italic> Topo I by <italic>E.coli</italic> RecA.</p><p>The observed specificity of the effect of RecA on type IA topoisomerases supports a possible involvement of a protein&#x02013;protein interaction between <italic>E.coli</italic> RecA and <italic>E.coli</italic> Topo I in RecA-mediated stimulation of Topo I activity. So far, we failed to detect any direct interaction between purified RecA and Topo I proteins in solution (data not shown) and the RecA&#x02013;Topo I interaction was not detected in a systematic identification of protein&#x02013;protein interactions in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>).

The novel mitogen &#x0201c;lacritin&#x0201d; is apically secreted by several nongermative epithelia. We tested 17 different cell types and discovered that lacritin is preferentially mitogenic or prosecretory for those types that normally contact lacritin during its glandular outward flow. Mitogenesis is dependent on lacritin's C-terminal domain, which can form an &#x003b1;-helix with a hydrophobic face, as per VEGF's and PTHLP's respective dimerization or receptor-binding domain. Lacritin targets downstream NFATC1 and mTOR.

Renewal of nongermative epithelia is by definition much more challenging to address. Yet, nongermative epithelia comprise most adult organs of the body, including exocrine and endocrine glands, kidney, and liver (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Rizvi and Wong, 2005</xref>). Recent cell lineage studies in the adult endocrine pancreas suggested that differentiated &#x003b2;-cells are renewed by self-duplication rather than via stem cells (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dor et al., 2004</xref>). General applicability to other nongermative epithelia has not been explored. However, this observation is in keeping with early [<sup>3</sup>H]TdR incorporation studies of exocrine and endocrine pancreas, liver, trachea, kidney, and the salivary, thyroid, and adrenal glands (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Messier and Leblond, 1960</xref>). A dynamically regulated state of differentiation is suggested by successful nuclear transfer from differentiated donor cells, and by the fusibility of differentiated muscle and brain cells with bone marrow stem cells (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sacco et al., 2005</xref>). If nongermative epithelia are broadly proliferative, one implication is that mitogenic stimuli are correspondingly widely dispersed&#x02014;much like the luminal distribution of differentiative hedgehog along the intestinal villus axis.</p><p>The human mitogen lacritin is preferentially associated with nongermative epithelia. Lacritin is apically secreted by acinar cells in the adult lacrimal gland and by a subpopulation of ductal cells in salivary glands (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sanghi et al., 2001</xref>), and it has been detected by nonhistological methods in thyroid (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sanghi et al., 2001</xref>) and mammary glands (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Weigelt et al., 2003</xref>) and some ocular surface cells, but not elsewhere. Acinar lumina and long ducts transport lacritin past apical membranes of the nongermative epithelia comprising both glands. Later, lacritin is deposited onto the rapidly renewing epithelia on the surface of the eye and mouth, where it can be detected by ELISA. Thus, instead of localized release to nurture crypt stem cells, as per Wnts, lacritin is apically secreted for broad distribution. Lacritin may therefore stimulate epithelia in its downstream path. Supporting this hypothesis are in vitro studies showing recombinant lacritin to be capable of promoting lacrimal acinar cell secretion, human salivary ductal cell proliferation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization by human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sanghi et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, release of lacritin may hypothetically define a combined secretory and proliferative field that spreads through the nongermative epithelia of lacrimal and salivary glands. Because other nongermative epithelia have luminal structures, secretory/proliferative fields might be a general principle.</p><p>We sought to characterize lacritin's domain, cell target specificity, optimal dose, and signaling pathways. We determine that lacritin targets only a small subset of epithelia, and not fibroblasts or glia. It does so via a C-terminal domain, which, in parallel studies (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2006</xref>), appears to require heparanase (HPSE) to unblock a binding site in the core protein of coreceptor syndecan-1 (SDC1). Lacritin signaling to PKC&#x003b1; activates both Ca<sup>2+</sup>&#x02013;NFAT and phospholipase D (PLD)&#x02013;mTOR pathways via the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor STIM1, suggesting a novel mitogenic approach for renewal.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Lacritin is a cell-selective mitogen</title><p>Lacritin flows over nongermative glandular epithelia of acini and ducts to later become deposited on the surface of the eye or mouth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The human salivary ductal (HSG) cell response to recombinant lacritin is bell-shaped with an optimal dose of 1 or 10 nM (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200605140/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200605140/DC1</ext-link>), promoting a level of proliferation often matching the FBS-positive control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This biphasic response and dosage is equivalent to that seen for sonic hedgehog, VEGF, FGF, and PDGF in other cell systems (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2004</xref>). Few other cell types are targeted by lacritin. Lacritin is mitogenic for HCE and human embryonic kidney cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), which both display a similar bell-shaped response (unpublished data). Lacritin does not appear to be mitogenic for human epidermal (A431), cervical (HeLa), foreskin fibroblast (HS68), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), erythroleukemia (K-562), noninvasive breast carcinoma (MCF7), melanoma (SK-MEL and WM-164), Leydig (TM4), Sertoli (TM3), and mouse fibroblast (NIH3T3) cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), or for human glioma (U-1242-MG and U-251-MG) cells, even at higher doses (unpublished data). Lacritin targeting is rapid. Lacritin signaling is apparent within the first minute by differential and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of at least nine different unidentified phosphoproteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) in an equivalent dose-responsive manner (unpublished data) that exceeds the moderately high level of endogenous phosphorylation that is characteristic of these cells. [<sup>3</sup>H]TdR uptake is also rapid, and it is detectable within 2 h of lacritin addition (unpublished data). Interestingly, p42 and p44 MAPK do not appear to be activated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), thereby minimizing the possibility that lacritin-dependent mitogenesis involves transactivation of the EGF pathway, or of another common Ras&#x02013;MAPK cytokine or growth factor pathway.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>
<bold>Cell target specificity of mitogenic lacritin.</bold> (A) Lacritin released from lacrimal acinar cell secretory granules flows via ducts to the surface of the eye. In the salivary gland, lacritin is generated by ductal cells and flows into saliva. Observations are based on ELISA detection of lacritin in human tears or saliva, and immunolocalization of lacritin in human lacrimal and salivary glands (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sanghi et al., 2001</xref>).

(B) Lacritin targeting of HSG cells promotes a bell-shaped mitogenic response with maximum proliferative activity at 1 or 10 nM lacritin, similar to that of the 10% FBS&#x02013;positive control. Lacritin also targets downstream HCE and human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Cell types that were not responsive include the following: A431, HeLa, HS68, HT1080, K562, MCF7, NIH3T3, SKMEL, TM3, TM4, or WM164 cells. In other studies, lacritin promotes secretion and Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization by rat (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sanghi et al., 2001</xref>) and rabbit (unpublished data) lacrimal acinar cells.

(2003)</xref> suggested that the putative breast cancer oncogene dermcidin is a homologue of lacritin. Comparing both by near optimal alignment revealed three weakly homologous regions in the C-terminal half (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Smoot et al., 2005</xref>), two of which reside in predicted &#x003b1;-helices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Several C- and one N-terminal truncation mutants were therefore generated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Mutants lacking 5 and 10 aa from the C terminus, or 24 aa from the N terminus, were fully active. Removal of 5 or 10 more C-terminal amino acids (C-15 or C-20), respectively diminished or completely abrogated activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>, shown at 10 nM). This pattern is mirrored by loss of binding to the core protein of lacritin coreceptor SDC1 (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the 10 additional C-terminal amino acids deleted from C-10 (aa 100&#x02013; 109 of mature lacritin; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) are important for both activities. To determine whether this region is capable of &#x003b1;-helical formation, we synthesized the active region KQFIENGSEFAQKLLKKFS with several flanking amino acids and subjected it to circular dichroism. In PBS it formed a random coil, and in 10 mM dodecylphosphocholine it formed an &#x003b1;-helix (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Although plasma membrane (PM) insertion is not in keeping with lacritin's low nanomolar activity and cell specificity, hydrophobic surfaces on the same or different proteins can create an environment appropriate for &#x003b1;-helical formation (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Murre et al., 1989</xref>). By &#x0201c;helical wheel,&#x0201d; 5 of 10 residues in the active region are hydrophobic, and all group along one face (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>) as an amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix. Amphipathic &#x003b1;-helices are common in ligand&#x02013;receptor or ligand&#x02013;ligand interactions. The hydrophobic face of PTHLH's C-terminal amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix, for example, mediates binding of PTHR1 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barden et al., 1997</xref>). The same mechanism directs VEGF dimerization as a prerequisite for FLT1 and KDR receptor binding (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Siemeister et al., 1998</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>

Lacritin-targeted HCE cells rapidly mobilize intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sanghi et al., 2001</xref>), and in HSG cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of at least nine unidentified proteins follows within a minute of lacritin addition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). p42 and p44 activation were excluded (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), suggesting that lacritin mitogenic signaling was likely distinct from the Ras&#x02013;MAPK pathway common to many growth factors and cytokines. Although lacritin binds SDC1 (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2006</xref>), its demonstrated signaling properties are limited. Loading HSG cells with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo-4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) revealed that the mitogenic dose of lacritin (10 nM), but not of nonmitogenic C-25 deletion mutant, usually promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization within 30 s of addition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;C, and E</xref>). Several common inhibitors were tested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Preincubation with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) completely inhibited mobilization, suggesting an upstream requirement for active G proteins G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> or G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub>. Cells treated with positive control muscarinic agonist carbachol were unaffected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Carbachol's G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>-mediated pathway is well known to be insensitive to PTX. The aminosteroid U73122 was tested next. U73122 inhibits G protein&#x02013;mediated activation of PLC that, in turn, catalyzes the formation of IP<sub>3</sub> and DAG. 1 &#x003bc;M U73122 inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization by both lacritin and carbachol (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), suggesting that PLC-generated IP<sub>3</sub> directs Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores. To test this hypothesis, cells were incubated in 2-[<sup>3</sup>H]myo-inositol for 24 h and then stimulated. IP<sub>3</sub> generation was detected within 15 s of adding lacritin or carbachol. None was formed with C-25 (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/contents/full/jcb.200605140/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/contents/full/jcb.200605140/DC1</ext-link>). DAG activates downstream PKC. Yet, when cells were preincubated with 1 &#x003bc;M of the PKC inhibitor Go 6976, lacritin-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization was completely inhibited (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), suggesting an unusual upstream requirement for active PKC. In contrast, mobilization was unaffected in positive control carbachol-stimulated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), even at 10 &#x003bc;M Go 6976 (unpublished data). Therefore, lacritin signaling displays distinctive features.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>

<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al. (2000)</xref> demonstrated that specificities of protein kinase inhibitors are less narrow than initially thought. Although Go 6976 is the most selective of PKC inhibitors, in vitro assays reveal the capacity to inhibit elements of the MAPK (MKK1 and MAPKAP-K1b), ERK/p38 (MSK1), Rho (ROCK2), and Akt (S6K1) pathways, as well as GSK3B downstream of G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>.

PKC&#x003b1; mRNA was thus targeted for degradation by RNAi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). HSG cells were transfected with a pool of four siRNAs for PKC&#x003b1;. PKC&#x003b1; became depleted, and transfected cells failed to proliferate in response to lacritin. Serum-triggered mitogenesis was slightly reduced (&#x0201c;D7&#x02013;D10&#x0201d;) in comparison to mock and negative controls. Cells were then individually transfected with each of the four siRNAs. Both PKC&#x003b1; D7 and D10 transfectants were lacritin unresponsive, but completely serum responsive in proliferation assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Importantly, further testing of D7 revealed no lacritin-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>; bottom). We hypothesize that ligation of coreceptor SDC1 (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2006</xref>) is coupled to binding of a G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor, thereby successively activating G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> or G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub>, PKC&#x003b1;, and PLC.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>

BHQ reversibly inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPase, thereby preventing refilling and allowing depletion of intracellular ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. 10 &#x003bc;M BHQ pretreatment inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization by lacritin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>), suggesting that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores are targeted by lacritin signaling, in keeping with lacritin-dependent IP<sub>3</sub> generation (Fig. S2). Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (SOC) influx is the movement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> across the PM in response to depleted Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ambudkar, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Putney, 2005</xref>). High concentration 2-APB is an inhibitor of SOC influx. When 100 &#x003bc;M 2-APB was added to lacritin- or thapsigargin-treated cells at maximal mobilization, suppression was immediate (unpublished data). TRPC channels (including TRPC1 in HSG cells; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2000</xref>) have been proposed to be essential for SOC. In two recent comprehensive and independent siRNA screens for SOC mediators, the major hits were to STIM1 and STIM2 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Roos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Liou et al., 2005</xref>). To determine whether STIM1 or TRPC1 may play a role in lacritin-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, HSG cells were depleted of each by siRNA. Lacritin stimulation of cells in nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free media, followed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, revealed that influx was suppressed in STIM1-depleted cells (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/contents/full/jcb.200605140/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/contents/full/jcb.200605140/DC1</ext-link>). Influx in cells lacking TRPC1 appeared unaffected. Collectively, these results suggest that PKC&#x003b1; plays a central role in lacritin mitogenic signaling, and that STIM1, but not TRPC1, may be necessary for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, possibly via a SOC mechanism. This pattern was later confirmed in NFAT translocation and mitogenesis experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Lacritin stimulates translocation of PKC&#x003b1; to the perinuclear Golgi region (PNG)</title><p>PKC&#x003b1; regulation of cell proliferation is initiated by translocation of cytoplasmic PKC&#x003b1; to membranes. Interaction of membrane-associated PKC&#x003b1; with other membrane-associated effectors drives downstream signaling to mitogenesis. To appreciate how lacritin mitogenic signaling is transduced in the context of Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, we asked whether lacritin promotes PKC&#x003b1; translocation and, if so, to which membrane compartment. PKC&#x003b1; was imaged in cells 15 min after treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). 10 nM nonmitogenic C-25 had no effect, leaving PKC&#x003b1; diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, 10 nM lacritin or N-24 shifted PKC&#x003b1; primarily to the PNG, as confirmed by colocalization with the Golgi marker mannosidase II (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Cells treated with positive control PMA concentrated PKC&#x003b1; solely in the PM (unpublished data). The phosphorylation state of PKC&#x003b1; influences its translocation site. Hyperphosphorylated PKC&#x003b1; becomes associated with the PM, whereas hypophosphorylated or dephosphorylated PKC&#x003b1; is known to translocate to the PNG (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hu and Exton, 2004</xref>). To determine if the latter is true and, if so, over what time course, cells were treated with lacritin, N-24, and C-25. Cell lysates were then blotted for phospho-PKC&#x003b1; (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). 10 nM lacritin promotes PKC&#x003b1; dephosphorylation within 1 min of addition. This form is sustained for at least 15 min, but by 30 min has returned to baseline phosphorylation. Dephosphorylation triggered by increasing molar levels of lacritin or N-24 mirrored the proliferation response, with optimal dephosphorylation at 1 or 10 nM. Nonmitogenic C-25 had no effect, whereas positive control PMA promoted some phosphorylation. It was suggested that lacritin-stimulated signaling toward Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization follows a G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> or G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub>&#x02013;PKC&#x003b1;&#x02013;PLC pathway. If so, PTX and Go 6976, but not U73122 should inhibit PKC&#x003b1; translocation. We retested each and observed that lacritin-dependent PKC&#x003b1; translocation and dephosphorylation were inhibited by 100 ng/ml PTX and 1 &#x003bc;M Go 6976, but also by 1 &#x003bc;M U73122 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The weakly active analogue U73343 is often used as a negative control for U73122. Cells preincubated with 1 &#x003bc;M U73343 displayed full translocation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). This implies that an interdependent complex of PKC&#x003b1; and PLC may be intermediate between G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> or G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub> activation and PKC&#x003b1; translocation, most logically in the PM. Yet as early as 1 min, PKC&#x003b1; was dephosphorylated, and therefore likely already translocated to the PNG. An alternative possibility is that a PLC isomer is stationed in the PNG and when active serves to capture translocating PKC&#x003b1;. PLC&#x003b3;2 is concentrated in the PNG in mast cells before and after antigen stimulation (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al., 1998</xref>). Is PLC&#x003b3;2 or another PLC isomer located in the PNG of HSG cells and, if so, does it complex with PKC&#x003b1;? Cells were treated for 15 min with 10 nM lacritin, and then immunostained for PKC&#x003b1; and PLC&#x003b3;2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). PLC&#x003b3;2 displays a discrete perinuclear Golgi localization, which partially overlaps with PKC&#x003b1; (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>), suggesting that the two are in sufficient proximity to form a signaling complex. The existence of a PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02013;PKC&#x003b1; complex was, including some activated PLC&#x003b3;2, confirmed by anti-PLC&#x003b3;2 immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>

Local generation of IP<sub>3</sub> then may drive Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, followed by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via a STIM1-regulated mechanism. Could other effectors be activated from this site? Recently, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hu and Exton (2004)</xref> linked perinuclear translocation of hypophosphorylated PKC&#x003b1; to activation of PLD1 via a protein&#x02013;protein interaction. PLD1 is most concentrated in the PNG and plays a key role in cell proliferation and secretion (for review see <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Foster and Xu, 2003</xref>), which are both functions of lacritin. Therefore, we hypothesized that lacritin-stimulated translocation of hypophosphorylated PKC&#x003b1; activates perinuclear Golgi PLD to, in turn, generate phosphatidic acid by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. Endogenous PLD activity was measured. After lacritin addition, PLD displays a bell-shaped activation curve that was optimal at 10 nM lacritin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>), thus, recapitulating the same dose dependency observed for mitogenesis, PKC&#x003b1; translocation, and PKC&#x003b1; dephosphorylation. To ask whether PKC&#x003b1; was upstream of PLD in lacritin signaling, cells were transfected with D7 siRNA. Depletion of PKC&#x003b1; completely abrogated PLD activation in response to lacritin, whereas PLD activation by serum was unaffected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). By confocal microscopy, PLD1 displays a broader perinuclear, and partially nuclear, distribution that partially colocalizes with PKC&#x003b1; in lacritin-stimulated cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Both are detected in anti-PLC&#x003b3;2 immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Therefore, it appears that transiently hypophosphorylated perinuclear Golgi PKC&#x003b1; complexes with PLC&#x003b3;2 to perform at least two roles. It triggers IP<sub>3</sub> generation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, and it also activates PLD1.</p></sec><sec><title>Common upstream signals diverge</title><p>Downstream lacritin signaling toward cell cycle progression may follow at least two different pathways. First, the prominence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization raises the possibility that cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> may stimulate the phosphatase calcineurin to activate cytoplasmic NFAT. Dephosphorylated NFAT translocates into the nucleus, where it binds DNA in an obligatory cooperative interaction with other transcription factors including Fos, Jun, GATA, and C/EBP. Second, because lacritin signaling activates PLD1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>) and active PLD1 generates phosphatidic acid, it is possible that lacritin signals to the mitogenic phosphatidic acid&#x02013;mTOR&#x02013;p70 S6 kinase 1 pathway (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2003</xref>). Hypothetically, both pathways could be additively required for lacritin mitogenesis, as per parallel ERK and mTOR mitogenic signaling in response to FGF-9 (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wing et al., 2005</xref>). Alternatively, one may modulate the other, as per PI(3)K/Akt inhibition of calcineurin in muscle IGF-1 signaling (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rommel et al., 2001</xref>). The first question was whether calcineurin is activated. Dose response assays revealed that lacritin activated calcineurin in a biphasic manner (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>) within 1 min of addition and was substantially reduced at 30 min (unpublished data). 10 nM nonmitogenic C-25 had no effect, whereas N-24 was activating (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Activation was dependent on PKC&#x003b1; and STIM1, but not TRPC1, and was inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Because NFAT in lacrimal, salivary gland, or corneal epithelia has not previously been studied, we chose to examine NFATC1, which is the only NFAT isomer selectively up-regulated in the proliferative compartment of skin epithelium (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Tumbar et al., 2004</xref>). We localized NFATC1 in cells 15 min after treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). 10 nM nonmitogenic C-25 had no effect; NFATC1 was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, 10 nM lacritin or N-24 shifted NFATC1 to the nucleus. For verification and to follow the dose response and time course, cells were treated with lacritin, N-24, and C-25, and then purified nuclei blotted for NFATC1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, B and C</xref>). 10 nM lacritin promoted NFAT translocation within 1 min of addition. Translocation was sustained for 30 min. As per PKC&#x003b1;, PLD, and mitogenic responses, 1 or 10 nM lacritin was optimal. In contrast, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose response is sigmoidal (unpublished data). This suggests that a step associated with calcineurin is responsible for the sigmoidal-to-biphasic transition. To ask whether NFATC1 translocation was downstream of G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> or G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub>, PKC&#x003b1; and PLC cells were treated with each of the inhibitors. Translocation was inhibited by PTX, U73122, and Go 6976, but not by the negative control U73343 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Cells transfected with siRNA for PKC&#x003b1; or STIM1 (but not for TRPC1) were also incapable of lacritin-dependent NFATC1 translocation, as were cells in EGTA (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>). This could be quantitated at the cellular level (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/contents/full/jcb.200605140/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/contents/full/jcb.200605140/DC1</ext-link>). As noted, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated calcineurin promotes NFATC1 translocation. CsA inhibits calcineurin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Addition of 1 &#x003bc;M CsA to cells completely blocked lacritin-dependent NFATC1 translocation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>). To ask whether this pathway is mitogenic, 1 &#x003bc;M CsA was included in the proliferation assay. Other cells were depleted of NFATC1 or STIM1 by siRNA. All three approaches blocked lacritin-stimulated mitogenesis (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, C and D</xref>). PTX, U73122, and Go 6976, but not U73343, nifedipine (unpublished data), or depletion of TRPC1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 C</xref>), also blocked mitogenesis. Thus, mitogenesis via lacritin-induced NFATC1 translocation appears to be downstream of G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> or G&#x003b1;<sub>o</sub>&#x02013;PKC&#x003b1;-PLC&#x02013;Ca<sup>2+</sup>&#x02013;calcineurin. Moreover, upstream STIM1 appears to be essential as a regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx necessary for NFATC1 translocation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>

Both also suppressed COX2 expression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>). Recently phosphoactivated RSK was found to bind and stabilize an activated NFATC4&#x02013;DNA complex, thereby contributing to transcriptional activation (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). Phosphorylation of RSK is rapamycin-insensitive and downstream of p42/p44. In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, we showed that p42/p44 is not activated by lacritin.

The possibility that lacritin transactivates another growth factor pathway involving Rho-MAPK appears to be ruled out by lack of MAPK1/MAPK2 and pRSK activation.</p><p>Like the Wnt&#x02013;Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway, lacritin signaling is PTX-sensitive and involves NFAT. NFATC1 regulates prostate cancer cell expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2003</xref>), smooth muscle proliferation in response to PDGF, and lymphocytic cell cycle progression (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Caetano et al., 2002</xref>). Linkage of mTOR signaling to cell proliferation has been documented in stem cells of the cerebral cortical proliferative zone (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sinor and Lillien, 2004</xref>), CD133(+) bone marrow&#x02013;derived endothelial precursors (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Butzal et al., 2004</xref>), and, to a considerable extent, in embryonic stem cells of preimplantation embryos (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gangloff et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, each plays key roles in cell proliferation. Upstream PKC&#x003b1; signaling differs. Wnt5a promotes translocation of PKC&#x003b1; to the PM (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sheldahl et al., 1999</xref>), whereas lacritin signaling (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>) appears to stimulate the formation of a transient perinuclear Golgi complex of PKC&#x003b1;, PLD1, and PLC&#x003b3;2. This activates PLD1 of the mTOR pathway. Some PLC&#x003b3;2 activation and considerable IP<sub>3</sub> generation were detected. Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization may then be a direct spatiotemporal consequence of PKC&#x003b1; perinuclear Golgi translocation via local generation of IP<sub>3</sub> &#x02013; thereby placing PKC&#x003b1; upstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The exact mechanism is unclear. Although supported by PKC&#x003b1; knockdown, Go 6976 suppression can, for example, seem contradictory at first glance. Normally, Go 6976 opposes PKC&#x003b1; phosphorylation as a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to PKC&#x003b1;'s catalytic domain, whereas in lacritin-treated cells the opposite appears to be true. Mirroring our observation, the PKC&#x003b1; inhibitors RO and Bis-1 prevent dephosphorylation of PKC&#x003b1; and translocation to the PNG after PMA treatment of COS-7 cells (a system in which PKC&#x003b1; translocates to both PM and Golgi). <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hu and Exton (2004)</xref> accordingly proposed that RO and Bis-1 may be acting as inhibitors of dephosphorylation or inducers of phosphorylation via another protein kinase or phosphatase, as is also likely the case for Go 6976. Interestingly, Go 6976 is also capable of suppressing the activity (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al., 2000</xref>) of the mTOR effector and inhibitor S6K1 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Holz and Blenis, 2005</xref>), but this is likely inconsequential to lacritin signaling. PKC&#x003b1; is also upstream of calcineurin, and it is possible that biphasic PKC&#x003b1;-dependent regulation of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1 may drive calcineurin's biphasic response to lacritin. This would effectively transform the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sigmoidal response into the observed biphasic mitogenic response.</p><p>Lacritin also promotes COX2 expression as a downstream consequence of NFATC1 activation. Both NFAT and mTOR inhibitors appear to suppress expression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>). This raises the possibility that NFAT and mTOR mitogenic pathways might overlap before COX2 transcription in HSG cells. COX2 is also widely linked to epithelial proliferation and survival (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Slice et al., 2005</xref>), and, when dysregulated, to epithelial tumors. Mice transgenic for COX2 display sebaceous gland hyperplasia when expression is driven by the keratin 5 promoter (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Neufang et al., 2001</xref>) and enhanced mammary alveolar differentiation when controlled by the MMTV promoter (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2001</xref>). Both conditions are associated with enhanced secretory product (lipid or &#x003b2;-casein, respectively), independent of an effect on cell number. Because lacritin is both mitogenic and prosecretory, it is possible that COX2 might mediate both functions. This possibility is in keeping with new lacritin studies suggesting that the prosecretory and mitogenic dose&#x02013;response curves might overlap in HCE cells (unpublished data). On the other hand, 10 nM lacritin did not promote amylase expression (unpublished data) by HSG cells that, for mitogenic studies, were routinely plated on plastic, or in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling for only short periods on a thin basement membrane coating. Others have shown that HSG cells require several days of growth on a thicker basement membrane substratum to promote amylase production and cell polarization (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 1996</xref>). Secretory vesicles (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Royce et al., 1993</xref>) are detected together with the formation of acinar-like structures.</p><p>The discovery of STIM1 and, very recently, Orai1 as being, together, essential for SOC influx (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Peinelt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Soboloff et al., 2006</xref>) opens new areas of investigation. STIM1 undergoes ER to PM or near-PM translocation regulated by its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF hand (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Orai1 is thought to form or help form the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel. TRPC1 is considered to be a SOC candidate (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ambudkar, 2006</xref>). TRPC1 is endogenously expressed in HSG cells, and when stably overexpressed enhances SOC influx, unlike overexpression of TRPC3 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2000</xref>). Why would depletion of TRPC1 have no effect on lacritin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, NFATC1 translocation, or mitogenesis; or on SOC in the thapsigargin-treated cells of <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Roos et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Liou et al. (2005)</xref>? Possibly another TRPC compensates (i.e., TRPC3 at low levels is store operated; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez et al., 2003</xref>), although SOC was not affected by coordinated targeting of all three <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> trp genes (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Roos et al., 2005</xref>). We ruled out the possibility that siRNA depletion was not complete (Fig. S3 A). TRPC1 may turnover relatively slowly and, thus, protein levels might take longer to lower, yet recent 80 nM siRNA depletion of TRPC1 protein in IEC cells was almost and entirely complete by 24 and 48 h, respectively (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Marasa et al., 2006</xref>). Because we have not examined the effect of siSTIM1 or siTRPCI on thapsigargin-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry or NFAT activation, it is possible that the mechanism observed is relatively specific for lacritin. FBS stimulation was unaffected by both depletions. Early studies suggested that STIM1 overexpression affects cell phenotype and adhesion without diminishing viability (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Oritani and Kincade, 1996</xref>) or, contrastingly, is apoptotic (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Manji et al., 2000</xref>). We observed no apparent affect of STIM1 depletion on adhesion, and have found lacritin to be antiapoptotic (unpublished data). Future studies seeking to move lacritin from HSG cells to mouse models and primary cultures of dispersed glands (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2001</xref>) provide an opportunity to explore these interrelated observations. How does lacritin selectively target some, but not other, epithelia? New data suggests a novel mechanism in which extracellular HPSE unblocks a lacritin-binding site on the core protein of SDC1 (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). This transforms a widely expressed cell surface proteoglycan into a selective coreceptor that hypothetically presents lacritin to a lower affinity signaling receptor. siRNA depletion of HPSE abrogates lacritin-dependent, but not EGF-dependent, mitogenesis. In pull-down assays, SDC1 core protein binding maps to lacritin's mitogenic domain. Neither syndecans-2 nor -4 bind lacritin, in keeping with poor ectodomain conservation. Immunostaining for SDC1 in human lacrimal gland reveals a basolateral distribution that appears to reach to the apical surface (unpublished data). HPSE cleavage of heparan sulfate is associated with follicular stem cell migration in mouse skin (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Zcharia et al., 2005</xref>) and when added exogenously inhibits stroma-induced quiescence of bone marrow stem cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 1997</xref>). Whether lacritin can act on corneal/limbal stem cells as it flows onto the eye is not known. Lacritin's HPSE-dependent binding of SDC1 ectodomain contrasts with heparan sulfate&#x02013;binding growth factors such as FGF's, Wnts, and hedgehogs, which do not appear to discriminate among syndecans or other heparan sulfate proteoglycans. By limiting availability of HPSE, lacritin can hypothetically target fewer differentiated epithelia as it flows downstream.</p><p>Like lacritin, several other mitogens are secreted apically, including TGF&#x003b2;1 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 2004</xref>), neurotrophin (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yeaman et al., 1997</xref>), and VEGF (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hornung et al., 1998</xref>), as well as EGFs, TGFs, HGF, and FGFs, and have all been detected in lacrimal and salivary ductal secretions. Although apical membranes are not commonly considered to be receptor-rich, CD-44 (mammary gland, salivary gland, and pancreas) nucleates MMP7 and pro&#x02013;HB-EGF in an apical complex with ErbB4 are necessary for epithelial cell survival (for review see <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Laurie, 2004</xref>). The M3 muscarinic receptor is apically concentrated in exocrine pancreas (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2005</xref>), and polarized MDCK cells sort nerve growth factor receptor to the apical surface (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yeaman et al., 1997</xref>). Such outward mitogenic flow from secretory cells through ducts of nongermative epithelia could potentially regulate secretory physiology and cellular renewal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human salivary ductal cells (HSG) were expanded in DME with 10% FCS (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sanghi et al., 2001</xref>) or, for mitogenesis experiments, in MEM (Eagle's &#x003b1; modification).

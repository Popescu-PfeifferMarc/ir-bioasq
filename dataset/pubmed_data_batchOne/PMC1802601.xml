Conventional methods to equip 8-17 with fluorescent signaling property usually involve covalent attachment of two dyes at nucleotide positions that are far away from the catalytic core, such that the bulky dye structures would not affect the deoxyribozyme activity. However, the maximum fluorescent enhancement associated with these 8-17 constructs is typically &#x02264;10-fold, due to a high fluorescent background. To find an optimal balance between signal enhancement and signaling speed, we have conducted a comprehensive study on the effects of the nature of dyes (Alexa Fluor 488, 546 and 647; QSY 9 and 21) as well as their attaching positions along the substrate strand on the catalytic and signaling performance of 8-17. Our results have indicated that 8-17 is able to cleave almost every modified substrate, including those that have chromophores only 1 nt away from the cleavage site. Most importantly, almost all of these substrates are able to generate 15- to 85-fold signal enhancement within 10 min. We have also provided guidelines for selecting substrates that could offer the best signal enhancement, the fastest signaling speed, or the best balance between signal enhancement and signaling speed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Deoxyribozymes are catalytic DNA oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) derived by <italic>in vitro</italic> selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). They are not only convenient models for studying nucleic acid catalysis, but are also suited for biotechnological applications. The advantages offered by catalytic DNAs include high chemical stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), low cost of synthesis and ease of modification. One catalytic DNA that has frequently been investigated in developing biosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), chemotherapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), computational devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and RNA-manipulation tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) is a small RNA-cleaving deoxyribozyme named 8-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The versatility of 8-17 is attributed to (i) its small size of &#x0223c;30 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), (ii) its adaptability in using various divalent metal ions as co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), (iii) its ability to cleave multiple dinucleotide junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), and (iv) its flexibility in accepting sequence or chemical modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Our goal here is to expand the versatility of 8-17 in the fields of fluorescence-based biosensing and nanotechnology by establishing 8-17 based signaling platforms with large signaling magnitudes and a broad emission wavelength coverage.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Various designs of fluorogenic 8-17 deoxyribozyme. (<bold>A</bold>) Substrates internally labeled with F and Q. The top strand is the chimeric DNA/RNA substrate in which the lone RNA phosphodiester linkage is denoted as &#x02018;r&#x02019;. Substrate nucleotides are numbered with respect to &#x02018;r&#x02019; as indicated. 8-17 is made up of a 15 nt catalytic core flanked by two substrate-binding arms that form Watson&#x02013;Crick interactions (small vertical lines) with the substrate.

(<bold>C</bold>) F and Q are at either end of the substrate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl1056f1"/></fig><p>There are two general methods to report the cleavage activity of 8-17 by fluorescence signaling. One entails the tagging of substrate and deoxyribozyme at opposing termini with a fluorophore (F) and a quencher (Q), which places F adjacent to Q when the deoxyribozyme binds the substrate [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>)]. The other involves the attachment of F and Q at either end of the substrate [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>)]. In the first system, the close proximity of F and Q, when the deoxyribozyme binds the substrate, can lead to fluorescence increase upon RNA cleavage. However, a high background signal can result because a fraction of fluorophore-labeled substrates is not associated with the deoxyribozyme strands. On the contrary, the second system does not have the deoxyribozyme/substrate association problem as both F and Q are situated on the same oligonucleotide strand. Nevertheless, a separating distance of 15&#x02013;20 nt between F and Q usually renders inefficient fluorescence-quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), resulting in small signal enhancement upon catalysis. Similar strategies have also been applied to equip other RNA-cleaving nucleic acid enzymes with fluorescence-signaling properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Yet, the maximum signal enhancement that could be attained (including that of 8-17) was typically &#x02264;10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), which is not ideal for sensitive and highly quantitative detection. One way to improve the signaling magnitude of doubly labeled substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) for deoxyribozymes such as 8-17 is to move F and Q closer to the cleavage site. However, this operation may significantly compromise the catalytic performance of deoxyribozymes due to steric hindrance to the folding of their catalytic cores caused by the bulky F and Q. In an effort to find the best balance between shortening the F-Q distance and maintaining the catalytic efficiency of 8-17, we examined 36 chimeric DNA/RNA substrates that have a common sequence context but are internally labeled at various sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) with one of the three Alexa Fluor (AF)&#x02013;QSY pairs: AF488&#x02013;QSY9, AF546&#x02013;QSY9 and AF647&#x02013;QSY21 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for chemical structures of these dye moieties). We chose to use AFs because (i) the wide variety of AFs spanning the visible and infrared spectrum allows us to develop a series of different probes for future multiplexing possibility, and (ii) they exhibit excellent emission intensity and photostability when conjugated to a biomolecule such as DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Chemical structures of Alexa fluorophores, QSY quenchers and modified nucleotides.

The labeled oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing PAGE. Each DNA-2 was then <sup>32</sup>P-labeled at its 5&#x02032;-end and annealed to a relevant DNA-1 in the presence of T4 DNA ligase and a DNA template. The ligated products were isolated by denaturing PAGE and quantified by comparing their radioactivity with that of a related DNA-2 whose concentration was determined spectroscopically (see Materials and Methods for details). It is noteworthy that this quantifying method was implemented because it is unclear whether the extinction coefficients at 260 nm of F and Q would vary when they are placed close to each other. It should also be noted that the 8-17 deoxyribozyme employed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) has a catalytic core equivalent to that of E1111 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), given that there are many versions of 8-17 reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Substrate preparation.

However, for the other series, this trend no longer holds as revealed by the large differences in max <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub> (&#x00394; max <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub>) between the substrates with F at &#x02212;2 and those with F at &#x02212;3.

Similarly in the AF647&#x02013;QSY21 series, &#x00394; max <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub> of 11, 24, 18 was resulted when Q was attached at +2, +5 or +6, respectively.

The majority of substrates labeled with the other two F&#x02013;Q pairs could also achieve a high <italic>Y</italic><sub>max</sub> ranging from 73 to 98%. The only two exceptions are the substrates with QSY9 at +3 and AF546 at &#x02212;2 and &#x02212;3, as they could be cleaved only to 55 and 27%, respectively. This suggests that the combination of QSY9 at +3 and AF546 at &#x02212;2 or &#x02212;3 exerts a profound negative impact on the folding of 8-17.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> value generally increases if F or Q is located closer to the cleavage junction, albeit to a smaller extent when Q is attached at +5, +6 or +7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). One of the exceptions in this trend is when Q is attached at +3. As clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> at T3 is much higher than any other position in each substrate series. This indicates that Q at +3 severely hinders the catalytic performance of 8-17 regardless of the quencher types examined here.

Consequently, an increasing fraction of the deoxyribozyme/substrate complexes is prevented from folding into the catalytically active state (resulting in <italic>Y</italic><sub>max</sub> reduction). With the same rationale, some of these complexes might be trapped in a conformation less optimal than the native structure, and necessitate an additional time for structural rearrangement in order to carry out catalysis (thus an increase in <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>). (ii) 8-17 may organize itself into a tertiary structure that has little room to accommodate a bulky attachment at +3 and, to a lesser degree, at +2 and +4. Therefore, the incorporation of a quencher at these locations brings about the most detrimental effect on the folding of the deoxyribozyme. However, it is also possible that the dyes may affect the catalytic mechanism of 8-17 by interacting with the nucleotide residues that participate in catalysis.</p><p>In view of the respectable max <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> accompanied with nearly all the examined substrates [except the ones with Q(+3)], one could easily design a doubly labeled fluorogenic substrate for 8-17 with the F and Q positions specified according to the desired signaling performance. For the highest max <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub>, the substrate with F(&#x02212;2) and Q(+2) in each F&#x02013;Q pair should be used. However, if fast signaling kinetics is most desirable for the application of interest, the substrate of choice should be guided by the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values instead. In this regard, the substrate with the smallest <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for each F&#x02013;Q pair is AF488(&#x02212;3)&#x02013;QSY9(+5), AF546(&#x02212;3)&#x02013;QSY9(+6) and AF647(&#x02212;2)&#x02013;QSY21(+7). Please note that several substrates with the same F&#x02013;Q pair might share very similar minimal <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Hence, only the ones with higher max <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub> are highlighted here.</p><p>To provide a better guidance for selecting a substrate that offers a balance between the signal enhancement and signaling speed, we have defined an arbitrary parameter termed &#x02018;performance index' by dividing max <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub> over <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). By this data treatment, the substrate having the highest <italic>PI</italic> for each F&#x02013;Q pair is determined to be AF488(&#x02212;3)&#x02013;QSY9(+5), AF546(&#x02212;3)&#x02013;QSY9(+5) and AF647(&#x02212;2)&#x02013;QSY21(+6), respectively.</p><p>In conclusion, we have successfully obtained efficient fluorescence-signaling platforms composed of the small RNA-cleaving deoxyribozyme 8-17 and a series of cleavable substrates internally labeled with an F&#x02013;Q pair. Our results have also revealed that 8-17 can accommodate bulky dyes on most of the nucleotide positions along the substrate strand. Most importantly, the discovery that many of these substrates were able to generate 15- to 85-fold signal enhancement within 10 min will certainly attract many interests in further exploitation of 8-17 to develop better biosensors and nanodevices.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a research grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.

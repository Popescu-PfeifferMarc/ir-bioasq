for patients who have traditionally been treated in hospital. Many patients with
hereditary angioedema (HAE) experience intermittent severe attacks that affect their
quality of life and may be life-threatening. These attacks are treated with C1-inhibitor
concentrate which, for most patients, is infused at the local hospital. Home therapy
programmes for HAE are currently being established. This paper reviews the extent of use
of these programmes and summarizes the advantages and potential disadvantages of the
concept so far.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>C1-inhibitor deficiency</kwd><kwd>emergency treatment</kwd><kwd>hereditary angioedema</kwd><kwd>home therapy</kwd><kwd>quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant condition resulting from partial
deficiency of C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].
It is a rare disease, thought to affect between one in 10 000 and one in 50 000 people
worldwide [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Acquired angioedema
(AAE), which is also due to C1-INH deficiency, is phenotypically similar to HAE, although it
is associated typically with lymphoproliferative disease, or with autoantibodies to C1-INH
[<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Patients with C1-INH deficiency have reduced amounts of functional C1-INH, which at times
of physiological or psychological stress is insufficient to control local inflammatory
pathways. The complement and contact systems are activated, and excess bradykinin is
generated [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is this increased
bradykinin production that is believed to be the main factor in the development of local
oedema [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Oedema may occur at any
site, but most commonly affects the subcutaneous tissue, causing swelling of the limbs,
face, trunk or genitalia [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Oedema can
also affect the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, causing abdominal pain,
often with diarrhoea and/or vomiting, and the mucous membranes of the larynx, causing
laryngeal oedema, which may lead to death by asphyxiation [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Economic and political factors have contributed to the increased use of home therapy
programmes for patients who would have been treated previously in hospital. One group of
patients who may benefit from home therapy is those with HAE. This paper uses published data
(Medline) to assess the use of C1-INH concentrate home therapy in patients with HAE, and
includes evaluations of both the recommendations for patient selection for home therapy and
the documented benefits of self-administration of C1-INH replacement therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data have been collected from a Medline search of the English language literature to
identify papers that included information on the use of C1-INH concentrate as home therapy
in patients with HAE. The search included the years from 1985, the year that pasteurized
C1-INH concentrate replacement therapy was introduced, to August 2006. The keywords used for
the search were &#x02018;C1-inhibitor&#x02019;, &#x02018;C1-inhibitor concentrate&#x02019;,
&#x02018;C1-esterase inhibitor&#x02019;, &#x02018;C1-esterase inhibitor concentrate&#x02019;,
&#x02018;C1-INH&#x02019;, &#x02018;C1-INH concentrate&#x02019;, &#x02018;C1EI&#x02019; and
&#x02018;C1EI concentrate&#x02019;, combined with &#x02018;C1-inhibitor deficiency&#x02019;,
&#x02018;C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency&#x02019;, &#x02018;C1EI deficiency&#x02019;,
&#x02018;hereditary angio(o)edema&#x02019;, &#x02018;HAE&#x02019;, &#x02018;hereditary
angioneurotic (o)edema&#x02019; and &#x02018;HANE&#x02019;. These groups of keywords were then
put together, alone and in combination, with the search terms &#x02018;home&#x02019;,
&#x02018;self-administration&#x02019;, &#x02018;self-administered&#x02019;,
&#x02018;outpatient&#x02019; and &#x02018;home-based&#x02019;. The articles were retrieved and
analysed. Pertinent articles known to the authors but not appearing in the Medline search
results were also analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found six relevant papers: two case series [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] with two and 43 patients,

regular prophylaxis. C1-INH was self-administered or infused by a family member at home. The
results showed that where prophylactic C1-INH was given, patients experienced improved
quality of life (QoL) and reduced severity, duration and frequency of attacks. In addition,
C1-INH had an excellent safety profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Treatment of hereditary angioedema</title><p>Frequent or severe HAE attacks are disabling for the patient. Consequently, such attacks
are an indication for regular prophylaxis, usually with attenuated androgens such as
danazol that increase hepatic production of C1-INH [<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, attenuated
androgens may cause unacceptable side effects such as virilization [<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or hepatic abnormalities [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], or may be contraindicated otherwise, for
example in women who wish to become pregnant [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Fibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic
acid are alternative prophylactic agents, although the evidence base for their use is less
certain [<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Despite prophylaxis, many patients continue to experience
intermittent severe attacks that interrupt their activities of daily living and may be
life-threatening. These attacks are treated with C1-INH concentrate, which in most cases
brings about a response within 30&#x02013;90 min [<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Licensed C1-INH products are available in Germany, Austria,
Switzerland, France, Hungary, Argentina, Japan (Berinert P&#x000ae;, ZLB Behring, Marburg,
Germany) and the Netherlands (Cetor&#x000ae;, CLB, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). In other
European countries, including the United Kingdom, and in the United States, C1-INH is used
on a named-patient basis, or is completely unavailable.</p><p>C1-INH infusion is administered traditionally in hospital, usually in the emergency
department. However, this approach can lead to delays in administering treatment.
Emergency department staff may be unfamiliar with HAE and patients may not be triaged as
urgent. Delays may occur in locating C1-INH, which is not a routine stock item for most
hospitals. Such delays necessitate higher C1-INH doses to control the attack, unnecessary
hospital admissions and, occasionally, severe adverse incidents, including death
[<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Death rates from
HAE-related laryngeal oedema of 30&#x02013;40% have been reported. Although the
majority of deaths occur in undiagnosed patients, there remains an avoidable mortality in
those who are diagnosed [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Children with C1-INH deficiency are not usually considered for home therapy in the United
Kingdom, as there are no paediatric home therapy programmes. Fortunately, HAE is usually
mild in preadolescence. However, prophylactic options are limited: long-term attenuated
androgens present significant risks, including growth retardation, and are not recommended
[<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our literature search revealed that one German centre does provide
home therapy for children severely affected with HAE, suggesting that this option is
feasible for selected cases. Rusicke <italic>et al</italic>. describe how on-demand C1-INH
therapy is their first-line therapy for children, with regular prophylaxis for those who
experience very frequent attacks [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. More than 50% of their cohort of 325 patients infuse at home,
although the proportion of these who are children is not stated. The authors claim that
severe attacks are prevented, and hospital time and absence from school is reduced
(although detailed figures are not supplied).</p><p>Recently, consensus documents providing recommendations on the management of HAE have
been published by expert panels in Canada and the United Kingdom [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
Both the Canadian and UK documents recommend offering patients the option of home therapy.
In spite of a recent increase in interest in home therapy in those countries where C1-INH
is available [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], there is little
published literature on this topic and a relative lack of information available for
health-care professionals.</p></sec><sec><title>The need for home therapy in hereditary angioedema</title><p>As C1-INH can be difficult to obtain at short notice, practitioners are strongly
recommended to ensure that patients have a supply of C1-INH to keep in the refrigerator at
home [<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For the majority of patients, who have infrequent attacks, C1-INH is
taken to the local hospital for infusion. For those patients experiencing more than one
attack per month, repeated hospital admissions result in severe disruption to everyday
life, affecting the ability to work and carry out domestic duties, impairing
patients' confidence to travel too far from the local hospital and creating
anxiety. For these patients, or for patients living in remote areas where access to a
hospital may be difficult, home therapy (self-infusion or infusion by a family member) is
usually the best option and is likely to result in greatly improved QoL.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient selection for home therapy in hereditary angioedema</title><p>The available data suggest that patients included on C1-INH home infusion programmes must
fulfil certain criteria [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]: patients must have proven C1-INH deficiency
as determined by typical symptoms, low C1-INH protein or function and low C4 complement.
Genetic diagnosis is not widely available, but may be useful where diagnosis is unclear.
Oral prophylaxis must be optimized. Patients must have sufficiently frequent attacks; the
recommended frequency varies between centres, but is usually a minimum of one attack every
3 months [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, patients with
less frequent attacks may also benefit from home therapy and should be considered on an
individual basis. Patients should be motivated to comply with the home therapy programme
and be fully informed as to the risks and benefits. C1-INH should be stored at
2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C, although limited data suggest that lyophilized C1-INH concentrate may
be stable at room temperature (25&#x000b0;C) for up to 6 months [<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Twenty-four-hour access to help and advice
should be available, including the option of emergency hospital treatment [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Training programmes in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands include practical aspects
of C1-INH administration: hygiene and cannulation techniques, as well as indications for
C1-INH infusion and management of emergencies [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Attacks should be severe
enough to warrant C1-INH treatment &#x02013; usually severe abdominal pain or orofacial
oedema &#x02013; but not so severe as to require hospitalization; for example, attacks
causing symptoms of laryngeal obstruction. However, if airway obstruction is imminent,
treatment may be expedited by home administration of C1-INH concentrate while awaiting the
arrival of ambulance transport to hospital. Patients should be advised to consult a
physician if the symptoms of an attack are atypical, as the onset of an appendicitis or GI
infection may present with symptoms similar to abdominal attacks of HAE.</p></sec><sec><title>Government directives supporting home therapy</title><p>In many countries, the relationship between patient and medical professionals is
changing. Nurses and paramedics are taking on tasks that were previously the
responsibility of doctors, and many patients expect to take an active role in their own
management. Facilitated by the internet, the growth of self-help groups such as the UK
Primary Immunodeficiency Association (PiA) and HAE International (HAEI) has enabled
patients to &#x02018;network&#x02019; on a far wider scale than previously. Patients are
increasingly aware of initiatives that can improve their QoL and, as a result, many
patients are requesting the option of home therapy. Initiatives such as the UK NHS Plan
and &#x02018;Expert Patient&#x02019; programmes seek to give patients the knowledge and
confidence to take a more active role in their own management [<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Established home therapy programmes</title><p>Intravenous home therapy programmes exist for a variety of conditions, including
intravenous immunoglobulins for antibody deficiency [<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and intravenous
antibiotics for patients with a variety of underlying conditions [<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These programmes have helped establish the feasibility and
cost-effectiveness of home therapy. However, perhaps the closest parallel with C1-INH home
therapy programmes is haemophilia home therapy. Like C1-INH, clotting factors for
haemophilia can be used prophylactically or as an emergency treatment.</p><p>Home therapy has been available in haemophilia since the 1980s and is now considered
&#x02018;routine&#x02019;. Most paediatric patients are receiving home therapy by 18 months
of age, as it is impractical for them to attend hospital several times a week for
treatment or preventative therapy [<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For children at high risk of bleeding, regular prophylaxis with
clotting factors can be given; for others, prompt treatment of any bleeds or prophylaxis
of high-risk events is preferable. Current UK guidelines [<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] suggest regular prophylaxis for those who have declared
themselves phenotypically severe (by virtue of two of more haemarthroses) and, for the
others, access to coagulation factors for administration at home, a local hospital or a
haemophilia centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Benefits of home therapy</title><p>The results of our Medline search included a recent paper by Levi <italic>et
al</italic>., who reported the experiences of 31 patients with C1-INH deficiency who were
trained to self-administer C1-INH [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
Patients, who all suffered from frequent, severe angioedema attacks, self-administered
1000 units of C1-INH concentrate shortly after the onset of severe abdominal, orofacial or
laryngeal attacks. Twelve patients, who had very frequent attacks (&#x0003e; 1 every 10
days) were treated additionally with prophylactic C1-INH concentrate every 5&#x02013;7
days. Mean follow-up was 3&#x000b7;5 years (range 0&#x000b7;9&#x02013;5&#x000b7;1). All
patients were trained successfully, and reported very low levels of technical failure with
venepuncture (&#x0003c; 2%). There were no adverse events of sufficient severity to
require medical assistance.</p><p>Self-administration of regular prophylactic C1-INH concentrate resulted in a significant
reduction in attack frequency, with seven of 12 patients reporting complete freedom from
attacks. Patients self-treating attacks reported a significant reduction in time to start
of symptomatic relief, and in time to complete resolution of the attack, compared with the
five &#x02018;historical control&#x02019; attacks immediately prior to entry into the
self-administration programme. Historical control attacks did not respond significantly
differently to C1-INH concentrate compared with attacks in control patients who did not
self-administer. The authors attributed the reduction in time to onset of relief and
attack duration to the reduced attack-to-treatment time associated with
self-administration. These observations are in accordance with Bork's observational
study, which reported that abdominal attacks treated with C1-INH concentrate within 2 h of
onset showed significant reduction in time to onset of relief compared with attacks where
treatment was delayed [<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This
study did not report separate outcomes on the subgroup of 25 patients who self-infused.
However, Rusicke <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] commented on the reduced attack-to-treatment time associated with home
therapy. Reduced attack frequency was also reported by Bork <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Kreuz <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Rusicke <italic>et
al</italic>. [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in patients who
infused prophylactically.</p><p>Reports from other home therapy programmes also indicate major benefits. Immunoglobulin
home therapy is associated with greater patient independence, convenience, comfort and
economic benefit [<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A recent study showed that home therapy significantly
improved health, school/social functioning (in children) and significantly reduced
emotional distress and limitations on personal time [<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In a similar study, home therapy with immunoglobulin
significantly improved QoL [<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
Patients in both surveys preferred home- to hospital-based therapy [<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
For patients with haemophilia, home therapy is associated with reduced pain and
disability, improved QoL and reduced hospitalization and time off work or school
[<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The availability of home
therapy has also been associated with improved life expectancy [<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Two of the case series in our analysis
mentioned improved QoL for HAE patients with access to home therapy, although formal
studies are lacking [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>A major issue for patients with HAE is the delay and difficulty in accessing emergency
care. Better awareness of HAE among medical staff and better liaison with emergency
departments is important, but can be difficult when medical staff change frequently, as is
the case in most emergency departments. Patient education is important to ensure prompt
attendance at hospital at an early stage of the attack. However, travelling time is likely
to be a limiting factor. For those patients with rapid-onset attacks, or who live far from
the hospital, the resulting delay may pose a significant risk. Access to emergency
treatment can often be expedited only by self-infusion/home therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Home therapy for acquired angioedema</title><p>Interestingly, the Levi study group included three patients with AAE, whose benefit did
not differ significantly from those with HAE. C1-INH concentrate appears effective in the
management of acute attacks of AAE, even when C1-INH antibodies are present, although some
patients may require higher doses or become resistant to treatment [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Bork
and Witzke reported a patient with frequent AAE attacks who was treated with C1-INH 1000
units every 5 days [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Treatment was
initially successful, but after 10 months the patient became progressively resistant
(<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Despite reservations about its
durability, C1-INH home therapy remains an option for patients with AAE.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding and resources</title><p>C1-INH is currently considered an expensive treatment option (approximately
&#x000a3;290/&#x02022;425 for 500 units). Home therapy has the potential to increase
overall use of C1-INH by treating attacks that would previously have gone untreated,
although published data do not suggest that this is the case when compared with optimum
hospital-based treatment [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>However, untreated attacks are costly in social, pharmacoeconomic and QoL terms. HAE is a
lifelong condition, which usually becomes symptomatic in adolescence. Attacks may be
precipitated by emotional stress, minor infections or oestrogens [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].
Consequently, young adults are particularly at risk of frequent attacks and the lifetime
economic cost of disrupted education and employment is likely to be considerable.
Additionally, under-treated attacks &#x02013; where the patient presents late &#x02013; have
major direct costs, as higher doses of C1-INH are required and hospital admission is more
probable [<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Studies in antibody
therapy and haemophilia show that home therapy is the most cost-effective option for
delivering this type of care [<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Cost&#x02013;benefit
studies in HAE are required urgently.</p><p>Funding of treatments is coming under increased scrutiny in both insurance-based and
taxation-based health-care systems. C1-INH is unlicensed in several countries. In the
United States it is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, but can be
administered for compassionate use. Without FDA approval, HAE sufferers must pay the
entire cost of the therapy themselves. Licensing studies are under way for both
plasma-derived and recombinant C1-INH and for other therapies for acute attacks of HAE.
Access to C1-INH, whether hospital- or home-based, is likely to remain suboptimal until
licensed products are available. Even if licensed, the manufacturing costs of
plasma-derived C1-INH are likely to be out of reach for many middle- and low-income
countries. In the long term, recombinant C1-INH or inhibitors of the
bradykinin&#x02013;kallikrein pathway may provide a solution [<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In theory,
kallikrein- or bradykinin-pathway inhibitors also provide an option for patients with AAE
who are resistant to C1-INH.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety of C1-inhibitor concentrate</title><p>Products used for home infusion need to demonstrate a high standard of safety with
respect to immunological or allergic reactions. C1-INH is extremely well tolerated
[<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and our analysis did not
reveal any treatment-related adverse events [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, because it
is a plasma product, C1-INH raises particular concerns for patients and physicians
regarding virus transmission, particularly viral hepatitis and HIV [<xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It is a regulatory requirement in Europe
[<xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] for plasma donors to undergo a
comprehensive health screen. Each donation is then screened using serological methods for
the presence of HIV, hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV). All plasma-derived medicinal
products such as C1-INH concentrate are also recommended to undergo additional testing for
HCV using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p><p>The most widely available C1-INH concentrates undergo several additional voluntary safety
checks, including the testing of individual pools via PCR for HIV-1, hepatitis A, HBV and
parvovirus B19 [<xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], in addition to HCV. The plasma then enters the
manufacturing process, where it undergoes further virus inactivation and removal steps.
Inactivation is via pasteurization and removal via chromatography, in accordance with the
Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products' guidelines. Since its introduction in
1985, approximately 200 000 standard 500 unit doses of the most widely available
pasteurized C1-INH concentrate have been sold globally, and no apparent cases of virus
transmission have ever been identified [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Recent UK and Canadian consensus documents providing recommendations on the management of
HAE have endorsed the option of home therapy for HAE patients. This choice should
potentially be made available to all HAE patients, including those who suffer only
infrequent attacks, and children. The opportunity for patients to manage their health
enriches QoL, as the now-routine home administration of home haemophilia and immunoglobulin
replacement therapies have shown. However, C1-INH is still an expensive treatment option.
Therefore, prophylaxis should be optimized in HAE patients, especially those who have
frequent, severe or rapid onset of attacks. If prophylaxis is ineffective, such patients
should be prioritized for C1-INH home therapy.</p><p>Many patients are now requesting home therapy, as awareness of its advantages increases
through self-help networking, and this should be encouraged. C1-INH is currently not
licensed in many European countries, including the United Kingdom or the United States, and
many physicians and funding authorities are reluctant to endorse new initiatives for rare
diseases. However, given the proven efficacy and safety of C1-INH, licensing concerns can be
overcome by referring patients to specialist HAE centres, who retain overall responsibility
for clinical management and who have access to training programmes.</p><p>A review of the current situation in HAE management suggests that home therapy is indeed a
viable and effective option that should be considered highly beneficial for patients, their
families/carers and associated health-care professionals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Dr Longhurst's department has received unrestricted medical grants from Dyax, Jerini

Together, these two factors form a processive replication machinery, a replisome, which can use duplex DNA as template to synthesize long stretches of single-stranded DNA. We here address the importance of the smaller, accessory B subunit of DNA polymerase <bold>&#x003b3;</bold> and demonstrate that this subunit is absolutely required for replisome function. The duplex DNA binding activity of the B subunit is needed for coordination of POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme and TWINKLE helicase activities at the mtDNA replication fork. In the absence of proof for direct physical interactions between the components of the mitochondrial replisome, these functional interactions may explain the strict interdependence of TWINKLE and DNA polymerase &#x003b3; for mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Furthermore, mutations in TWINKLE as well as in the catalytic A and accessory B subunits of the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme, may cause autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia, a disorder associated with deletions in mitochondrial DNA. The crucial importance of the B subunit for replisome function may help to explain why mutations in these three proteins cause an identical syndrome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The molecular mechanisms by which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is replicated in mammalian cells are of fundamental biological interest. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has served as a model system for studies of mammalian mtDNA replication, but there are significant differences between yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Replication of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mtDNA is initiated from multiple sites of the &#x0223c;86&#x02009;kb genome and the mtDNA molecules frequently undergo recombination. In contrast, the smaller mammalian mtDNA (&#x0223c;16&#x02009;kb) initiates DNA replication from two specific origins of replication, oriH and oriL, and recombination is a rare or possibly even non-existent phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The replicative DNA polymerase &#x003b3; (POL&#x003b3;) has been characterized in many species. In animal cells, the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme consists of a catalytic subunit (POL&#x003b3;A) and an accessory subunit (POL&#x003b3;B). POL&#x003b3;A has a molecular weight of 140&#x02009;kDa, and harbors polymerase and 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease activities. POL&#x003b3;B is present in <italic>Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), but is notably absent in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> POL&#x003b3;B acts as a processivity factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), which increases the affinity of the polymerase for DNA and promotes tighter nucleotide binding, thereby increasing the polymerization rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The crystal structures of both mouse and human POL&#x003b3;B have revealed the protein as a dimer with high similarities to aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Molecular modeling using the POL&#x003b3;B structure and the bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase ternary complex, has shown that POL&#x003b3;B together with POL&#x003b3;A may encircle the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), thereby tethering the enzyme to the DNA substrate and increasing processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). POL&#x003b3;B also binds non-specifically to stretches of duplex DNA longer than 45&#x02009;bp, but the functional importance of this activity remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The mitochondrial DNA helicase TWINKLE displays sequence similarity to the bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein, a helicase-primase required at the phage DNA replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). TWINKLE displays distinct substrate requirements and can only unwind short stretches (&#x0003c;20&#x02009;bp) of dsDNA in the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In a related way, the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme is unable to use dsDNA as template for DNA synthesis. However, when the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme and TWINKLE are combined, they form a processive replication machinery, a replisome, which can utilize duplex DNA as template to synthesize ssDNA molecules of about 2&#x02009;kb. Addition of the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) stimulates the reaction further, generating DNA products of about 16&#x02009;kb, the size of the mammalian mtDNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). A close functional interaction between the mitochondrial replication factors is also demonstrated by the many different mutations in both TWINKLE and POL&#x003b3;A, which cause autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), a human disorder associated with deletions in mitochondrial DNA. Recently a mutation in POL&#x003b3;B was also shown to cause the same disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Here we demonstrate that POL&#x003b3;B and its dsDNA-binding activity are absolutely required for the function of the mitochondrial DNA replisome. The dsDNA-binding activity of POL&#x003b3;B is not required to stimulate the DNA synthesis rate or the processivity of the POL&#x003b3;A, but is instead needed for functional interactions between the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme and TWINKLE at the mtDNA replication fork. In the absence of proof for direct physical interactions between the components of the mtDNA replisome, this functional interaction may explain the strict interdependence of TWINKLE and the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme for DNA synthesis on a duplex DNA template.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>TWINKLE, mtSSB, POL&#x003b3;A and POL&#x003b3;B were expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), with the following modifications. The peak fractions of POL&#x003b3;A from the Hi-trap Heparin column was diluted to 100&#x02009;mM NaCl with buffer B (20&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.5&#x02009;mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 10% glycerol and 1&#x02009;mM DTT) and loaded on a 1-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B (0.1&#x02009;M NaCl). The column was washed with three column volumes of buffer B (0.1&#x02009;M NaCl) and then eluted with a linear gradient (10&#x02009;ml) of buffer B (0.1 &#x02212; 1.0&#x02009;M NaCl). POL&#x003b3;A eluted at 400&#x02009;mM NaCl and the yield from 800&#x02009;ml of culture was about 1&#x02009;mg POL&#x003b3;A protein. The peak fractions of POL&#x003b3;B eluted from the Hi-trap Heparin column was dialyzed against buffer C (50&#x02009;mM NaPO4 [pH 7.0], 0.5&#x02009;mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 10% glycerol and 1&#x02009;mM DTT) containing 0.1&#x02009;M NaCl. POL&#x003b3;B was further purified on a 1-ml Hi-Trap SP column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer C (0.1&#x02009;M NaCl). After washing the column with three column volumes of buffer C (0.1&#x02009;M NaCl), POL&#x003b3;B was eluted with a linear gradient (10&#x02009;ml) of buffer C (0.1 &#x02212; 1.0&#x02009;M NaCl) and the peak of protein eluted at 300&#x02009;mM NaCl. A 6xHis-tagged version of POL&#x003b3;B cloned into pBacPAK9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) was used for PCR-based mutagenesis, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Plasmids containing the RK, RKK, IF and VV mutations were sequenced and used to prepare <italic>Autographa California</italic> nuclear polyhedrosis virus recombinant for the proteins as described in the BacPAK manual (Clontech). The mutant versions of POL&#x003b3;B were purified following the same protocol used for the wt, with the exception that the RK and RKK mutant did not bind to the heparin and SP columns, but eluted in the flow through fractions from both these columns. The proteins were concentrated on centricon 30 (Amicon). We estimated the purity of the proteins to be at least 95% by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

We constructed the POL&#x003b3;B-IF mutant by changing two conserved hydrophobic residues (I<sub>442</sub>F<sub>448</sub> to A<sub>442</sub>D<sub>448</sub>) in a region required for interactions with POL&#x003b3;A. In the crystal structure of POL&#x003b3;B, two Na<sup>+</sup> ions are buried in the dimer interface. The role of these metal-binding sites is not known, but the regular coordination geometry suggests that <italic>in vivo</italic> this could be a binding site for a divalent cation, e.g. magnesium. To address the functional importance of the metal-binding site for POL&#x003b3;B activity, we mutated two of the three amino acids involved in metal ion coordination (V<sub>119</sub>V<sub>125</sub> to A<sub>119</sub>A<sub>125</sub>) to construct the POL&#x003b3;B-VV mutant.

Others have shown that the RK and RKK mutations abolish the dsDNA-binding activity of POL&#x003b3;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>We expressed the mutant versions of POL&#x003b3;B in insect cells and the proteins were purified to near homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). To verify the properties of our mutant POL&#x003b3;B proteins, we first investigated the dsDNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Wild-type POL&#x003b3;B, as well as the IF and VV mutants bound duplex DNA in a gel-shift assay. In contrast, the RK and RKK mutants had lost the dsDNA-binding activity and failed to interact with the radioactively labeled probe.</p><p>We also investigated the ability of the mutant POL&#x003b3;B versions to interact with POL&#x003b3;A in a gel retardation assay. POL&#x003b3;A forms a distinct complex with a primed DNA substrate. POL&#x003b3;B alone does not bind the substrate, but can super-shift a POL&#x003b3;A&#x02013;DNA complex, thereby revealing direct POL&#x003b3;A&#x02013;POL&#x003b3;B interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). All the mutants, except the IF mutant super-shifted the POL&#x003b3;A&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).

We formed the template by annealing a 35-mer oligonucleotide to a complementary 20-mer oligonucleotide, to produce a primed-template with a 15 bases single-stranded 5&#x02032;-tail. We added POL&#x003b3;A in combination with POL&#x003b3;B to the radioactively labeled substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Following 10&#x02009;min of incubation, we added a 1000-fold excess of cold primed DNA substrate to the reactions and withdrew aliquots at the times indicated. POL&#x003b3;A alone dissociates from the template immediately after addition of competing primed DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 3).

All the POL&#x003b3;B mutants, except the IF mutant (which does not interact with POL&#x003b3;A) were able to support the same rate of DNA synthesis as the wt POL&#x003b3;B protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). We also monitored effects on POL&#x003b3;A processivity (data not shown). POL&#x003b3;A in isolation displays low processivity on a single-stranded DNA template, but becomes more processive when wt POL&#x003b3;B is added to the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The RK, RKK and VV mutants stimulated the processivity of POL&#x003b3;A to the same extent as wt POL&#x003b3;B which is in agreement with previous reports that the dsDNA-binding activity is not required for this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).

This balance is affected by the dNTP concentration. We monitored the ability of POL&#x003b3;B to influence this balance in a polymerase/exonuclease assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). First, we added POL&#x003b3;A in isolation to a radioactively labeled primed DNA substrate in the presence of different dNTP concentrations. In the absence of dNTP, the exonuclease/polymerase balance shifted in favor of the exonuclease activity, but with increasing amounts of dNTP the balance changed in favor of polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lanes 2&#x02013;6). Our experiments revealed that POL&#x003b3;A alone required a nucleotide concentration of about 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;M for net polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lane 6). Interestingly, addition of POL&#x003b3;B blocked the exonuclease activity of POL&#x003b3;A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, compare lanes 2 and 7), but did not change the dNTP concentration required for net polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, compare lanes 6 and 11). This observation is in agreement with previous reports that the excision rate of the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme is slower than for POL&#x003b3;A alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We also monitored the ability of POL&#x003b3;B mutants RK and RKK to influence the exonuclease/polymerase balance. These mutants blocked the exonuclease activity of POL&#x003b3;A to the same extent as the wt POL&#x003b3;B protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lanes 12&#x02013;22). Therefore, POL&#x003b3;B inhibits the POL&#x003b3;A exonuclease activity and the POL&#x003b3;B dsDNA-binding activity is not required for this inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>POL&#x003b3;B is required for mtDNA replisome function</title><p>All our experiments so far had been performed on single-stranded DNA templates. Our assays had revealed some novel aspects of POL&#x003b3;B function, but we had not been able to identify a functional role for the dsDNA-binding activity. We decided to investigate the role of POL&#x003b3;B for DNA synthesis on a duplex DNA template. To this end, we formed a template for DNA replication by annealing a 90-nt oligonucleotide to a 70-nt ssDNA mini-circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The template contained a replication fork for loading the replication machinery, a 50-bp dsDNA region and a free 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl terminus that could act as a primer for DNA synthesis. Once initiated, leading-strand DNA synthesis coupled to continuous unwinding of the double-stranded template could in principle progress indefinitely. We have previously reported that the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme can utilize the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl terminus on this mini-circle template and initiate DNA synthesis, but that the enzyme fails to elongate through double-stranded regions and only forms a 110-nt product. To elongate through the dsDNA region, the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme requires the DNA strand unwinding activity of the TWINKLE helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In agreement with these previous studies of the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme, we found that the POL&#x003b3;A subunit in isolation could initiate DNA synthesis on the mini-circle template, but failed to elongate through double-stranded regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 2). In contrast to our previous observations with the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme, the TWINKLE helicase was unable to stimulate POL&#x003b3;A elongation through dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 3). Addition of increasing amounts of POL&#x003b3;B to the reaction restored TWINKLE-dependent stimulation of POL&#x003b3;A and allowed for rolling-circle DNA synthesis on the dsDNA template. Our experiments therefore revealed that POL&#x003b3;B is absolutely required for mtDNA replisome function. In the absence of POL&#x003b3;B, TWINKLE cannot stimulate POL&#x003b3;A dependent DNA synthesis on a duplex template. Addition of mtSSB did not overcome this absolute requirement for POL&#x003b3;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lane 1).

The RK, RKK and IF mutants did not affect the ability of POL&#x003b3;A to initiate DNA synthesis from the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl terminus, but failed to support elongation through double-stranded regions and only allowed formation of the 110-nt product. The outcome of the experiment was not affected by addition of mtSSB to the reactions (data not shown). We could conclude that both the ability of POL&#x003b3;B to interact with POL&#x003b3;A and the dsDNA-binding activity are essential for mtDNA replisome function.</p><p>The functional role of the POL&#x003b3;B dsDNA-binding activity remained unclear. One explanation could be that this activity was required to stimulate the catalytic activity of POL&#x003b3;A on a duplex DNA template. Alternatively, the POL&#x003b3;B dsDNA-binding activity may be required for functional interactions with the TWINKLE helicase at the replication fork. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we utilized an exonuclease deficient version of POL&#x003b3;A in which a single amino acid substitution had abolished the 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease activity. Similar mutations in other DNA polymerases confer a strand displacement activity that allows the polymerases to use duplex DNA as a template for DNA synthesis even in the absence of a DNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Wild type POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme lacks strand displacement activity, but the impairment of the exonuclease activity allowed the polymerase to use dsDNA as template in the absence of TWINKLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Strand displacement DNA synthesis required the presence of POL&#x003b3;B (data not shown). In contrast, the dsDNA-binding activity was not required, since POL&#x003b3;B&#x02013;RK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) and POL&#x003b3;B&#x02013;RKK (data not shown) were both able to support DNA synthesis by POL&#x003b3;A-exo<sup>&#x02212;</sup> on a duplex DNA template. We could therefore conclude that the POL&#x003b3;B dsDNA binding is not required to stimulate the catalytic activity of POL&#x003b3;A on a duplex DNA template.

The TWINKLE helicase displays high primary sequence similarity to the gene 4 helicase-primase. Furthermore the T7 DNA polymerase and POL&#x003b3;A are both classified as family A DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Studies of bacteriophage DNA replication may therefore provide essential insights into the mechanisms of mammalian mitochondrial DNA replication. The replisome of bacteriophage T7 consists of four proteins: the gene 2.5 ssDNA binding protein, the gene 4 helicase-primase, the T7 DNA polymerase and the processivity factor thioredoxin. Similar to the situation in the mitochondrial replisome, the T7 DNA polymerase/thioredoxin complex can catalyze processive DNA synthesis on ssDNA templates, but it cannot use duplex DNA as a template in the absence of the gene 4 helicase-primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The T7 replication machinery can perform coordinated leading and lagging DNA synthesis. The gene 4 helicase-primase plays an essential role for the coordinated synthesis, since it provides binding sites for the two T7 DNA polymerases present at the fork, one on the leading strand and one on the lagging strand. A deletion of the 17&#x02009;C-terminal residues of gene 4 helicase-primase results in an inability to physically interact with T7 DNA polymerase. This mutation does not affect DNA-dependent nucleotide hydrolysis, helicase and primase activities, but impairs the coupling of polymerase activity to the helicase activity. The C-terminally truncated helicase-primase is at least 10-fold less effective in stimulating DNA synthesis than the wild-type gene 4 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>The mitochondrial minimal replisome can perform leading strand DNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> on a mini-circle template, but no lagging DNA synthesis is observed. Compared to the related T7 replisome, the mitochondrial replisome must have lost some key features, which are absolutely needed for coordinated leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. In agreement with this notion, there is no primase activity present in the mitochondrial replisome and such an activity would be necessary for lagging strand DNA synthesis to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). TWINKLE lacks an essential zinc-finger motif that is required for the primase activity of the related gene 4 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Furthermore, the physical interactions necessary for coordinated leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis in the phage T7 system are missing in the mitochondrial replisome. Even if we cannot formally exclude the possibility of transient interactions between TWINKLE and the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme during ongoing DNA synthesis, we have so far not observed direct protein&#x02013;protein contacts between these two enzymes using an array of techniques, including surface plasmon resonance, gel filtration, and the yeast 2-hybrid system (data not shown). In spite of the absence of detectable protein&#x02013;protein interactions with the TWINKLE helicase, the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme cannot be replaced by the T4 or T7 DNA polymerase at the reconstituted mtDNA replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The absence of detectable interactions may suggest that the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme contributes to replisome function with specific molecular functions that are not present in the phage DNA polymerases. The ability of POL&#x003b3;B to bind dsDNA is such a unique feature that is not found in thioredoxin, the accessory subunit of the T7 DNA polymerase.</p><p>The accessory POL&#x003b3;B subunit increases both the processivity and polymerization rate of the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme on an ssDNA template. As demonstrated elsewhere and here, the dsDNA-binding activity of POL&#x003b3;B is not required for this stimulatory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). A requirement for the dsDNA-binding activity is only observed on a duplex DNA template. The observed requirement is not due to effects on the catalytic activity of the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme. To demonstrate this point, we used an exonuclease deficient POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme that is capable of strand displacement DNA synthesis in the absence of TWINKLE. This mutant requires POL&#x003b3;B for DNA synthesis, but is not affected by mutations that abolish the dsDNA-binding activity. Instead, the absolute requirement of the dsDNA-binding activity is only seen when the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme functions together with TWINKLE at the mtDNA replication fork.</p><p>On an ssDNA template the DNA synthesis rate of the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme is about 360&#x02009;nt/s, whereas the mitochondrial replisome synthesizes DNA at a rate of about 180&#x02009;nt/s on a duplex template. The slower rate observed for the replisome, may suggest that the TWINKLE helicase dictates the speed of the mtDNA replication fork and that the trailing POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme is slowed down by the TWINKLE helicase ahead. A DNA polymerase trailing behind a slower DNA helicase will ensure that the two factors stay together at the replication fork. The POL&#x003b3;B subunit may have two crucial roles in this process. First, as mentioned above there is a delicate balance between the polymerase and exonuclease mode in the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme. If the polymerase is tailgating a slow moving DNA helicase, it could be stimulated to enter the exonuclease mode. The POL&#x003b3;B subunit effectively prevents this by inhibiting the POL&#x003b3;A exonuclease activity. Second, the dsDNA-binding capacity of POL&#x003b3;B may be required to ensure that the POL&#x003b3; holoenzyme stays bound to the template behind the slow-moving TWINKLE helicase. This idea is seemingly in contrast to findings by others and us, showing that the dsDNA-binding activity of POL&#x003b3;B is not required to stabilize interactions with a primed ssDNA template. However, one must remember that these investigations of primed ssDNA template interactions were done in the presence of ddNTP in order to trap the polymerase gamma in a ternary complex. These experiments are based on the knowledge that DNA polymerases form stable complex with a primed DNA template, provided that the primer template is terminated by a ddNTP and that the next dNTP specified by the template is simultaneously present. At the actual replication fork, the polymerase may instead be idling between the polymerase and exonuclease mode behind the slow-moving TWINKLE helicase. Under these conditions, the polymerase may be much more prone to leave the template and dsDNA-binding activity could be of crucial importance. In future work, we will address this and related possibilities to further clarify the molecular function of the dsDNA-binding activity of POL&#x003b3;B.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants to M.F. from the Swedish Research Council, &#x000c5;ke Wiberg foundation, The Swedish Society of Medicine, the Emil and Wera Cornell's foundation and European Commission (fp6 EUMITOCOMBAT).

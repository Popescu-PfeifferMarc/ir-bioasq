Here, we describe a functional dissection of the roles of the three principal structural modules of the homomultimeric MCM of the hyperthermophilic archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>. Our results include the first analysis of the central AAA+ domain in isolation. This domain possesses ATPase and helicase activity, defining this as the minimal helicase domain. Reconstitution experiments show that the helicase activity of the AAA+ domain can be stimulated by addition of the isolated N-terminal half in <italic>trans</italic>. Addition of the N-terminus influences both the processivity of the helicase and the choice of substrate that can be melted by the ATPase domain. The degenerate helix-turn-helix domain at the C-terminus of MCM exerts a negative effect on the helicase activity of the complex. These results provide the first evidence for extensive regulatory inter-domain communication within the MCM complex.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The core replication machineries of Eukarya and Archaea are fundamentally related, indicative of their descent from a common ancestor. Given the relative simplicity of the archaeal machinery, it serves as a valuable model system for dissection of the shared archaeo-eukaryotic replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The archaeal MCM is a homo-multimeric protein, while the MCM complex found in all eukarya is a heterohexamer composed of one copy of each of MCM 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. MCM 2-7 display considerable sequence homology to each other, and are presumably derived by gene duplication events from a single, archaeal-like, ancestral MCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In addition to MCM 2-7, recent work has described and characterised MCM 8, a homo-multimeric complex found exclusively in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). MCM 8 plays an important role in the elongation phase of replication, while MCM 2-7 is required for both initiation and elongation phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). It is believed that MCM 2-7 serves as the replicative helicase and, in support of this, a sub-complex of MCM 4,6 and 7, but not the entire MCM 2-7 complex, possesses 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; helicase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Similarly, a number of archaeal MCMs have been demonstrated to have processive 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>).</p><p>Electron microscopy has revealed that the MCM from the archaeon <italic>M. thermautotrophicum</italic> (Mth) can adopt a number of configurations, with hexamer, double hexamer, heptamer and filamentous structures observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). In solution, Mth MCM appears to exist primarily as a double hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). In contrast, studies to date indicate that the MCMs from <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> and <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (Sso) appear to be hexameric in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Further, a hexameric form of Sso MCM has been shown to bind model DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The double hexameric nature of Mth MCM in solution has been supported by the X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal 286 amino acids of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The structure revealed a sixfold symmetric arrangement, with hexameric rings forming double hexamers via a head-to-head interaction. A zinc-binding motif in the N-terminus of each subunit was positioned at the site of interaction between hexamers, suggesting an important role for this motif in mediating double hexamerisation. Intriguingly, however, mutational analysis of this motif did not reveal any alteration to multimeric status, but did show reduced DNA binding and helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The structure of Mth MCM (2-286) revealed three domains, A, B and C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Only domain C is essential for activity of Mth MCM and forms the core fold mediating multimerisation of the N-terminal portion of Mth MCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present an analysis of the Sso MCM and reveal that the C-terminal AAA+ domain, although dimeric in solution, retains helicase activity. The isolated AAA+ domain has promiscuous helicase activity, being able to catalyse melting of a broader range of model substrates than the full-length enzyme, including pure duplex and 5&#x02032; tailed molecules. This promiscuity can be alleviated by addition of isolated N-terminal domains in <italic>trans</italic>. In addition to modulating substrate specificity, the N-terminal domains, when added in <italic>trans</italic>, enhance the processivity of the enzyme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning and mutagenesis</title><p>The amino acids to which the different constructs correspond are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C.

Our results reveal that when 25&#x02009;&#x000b5;M full-length, wild-type MCM was assayed, we could detect a complex and broad elution profile, compatible with the presence of a mixed population with species of up to double hexamer in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This is the first time that greater-than-hexameric forms of the Sso MCM have been detected; lower concentrations of this construct give rise to primarily hexameric species (data not shown). However, previous reports have used substantially lower concentrations of protein; indeed, at lower protein concentrations, we see an elution profile compatible with generation of single hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In contrast to the above, analyses of 25&#x02009;&#x000b5;M of mutant Sso MCMs lacking the A domain, the HTH or both showed more homogeneous profiles, compatible with the formation of single hexamers of these species, suggesting that the N- and C-terminal domains of the MCM are important for formation of higher-order structures.

The profiles shown for each mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B show superimposed elution profiles for two concentrations of protein. The profiles obtained indicate that, at the lower concentrations, these proteins have an elution profile consistent with monomeric species; however, at higher concentrations, we observe a reduced retention time on the gel filtration column, suggestive of either conformational alteration or formation of multimeric forms of the protein. In support of the latter, when we perform glutaraldehyde-mediated crosslinking of the isolated N-half and core domains of MCM, we observe the generation of higher-order multimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). When the same concentrations of BSA were treated identically, the majority of the BSA stayed monomeric, with only trace amounts of dimer and trimer species detectable (data not shown). Gel filtration analyses of the N-terminal half of Mth MCM revealed that it forms an extremely stable double hexamer over a broad range of concentrations, our data indicate that this property is not shared by the N-half of SsoMCM. We next tested whether mixing the isolated N and C-terminal halves of the protein could result in the generation of higher-order forms. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, addition of the AAA+ domain to an excess of the N-terminal fragment results in a shift in the elution profile of the AAA+ domain to a higher-molecular-weight form, indicative of interaction between these species. We were additionally able to detect weak interactions in affinity chromatography approaches, employing a C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged version of the C-terminal half of the protein and a non-tagged version of the N-terminal half of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). Finally, glutaraldehyde-mediated crosslinking of a sample containing both N-half and core domain proteins resulted in an increased yield of very-low-mobility complexes that barely entered the resolving gel during SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding of Sso MCM derivatives</title><p>Next, we assayed the ability of the various mutant Sso MCMs to bind DNA with the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), using a radiolabelled fork substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B.

Thus, it appears that the HTH domain plays complex context-dependent roles; in the presence of the N-terminal B and C domains, removal of the HTH results in a stimulation of ATPase activity; this, however, is not seen when these domains are present.</p></sec><sec><title>Helicase activity of the Sso MCM mutants</title><p>Wild-type Sso MCM displays 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; helicase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). We tested the ability of the various truncated Sso MCM constructs to mediate melting of a flayed duplex DNA substrate. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, over the range of concentrations tested (0.1&#x02013;1&#x02009;&#x000b5;M), wild-type MCM effects melting of a maximum of 30% of substrate. Deletion of the HTH domain causes a large stimulation of the helicase activity of MCM, as compared to wild-type. This stimulation is particularly apparent at 111&#x02009;nM protein, where the helicase activity of the mutant lacking the HTH is 15-fold higher than the wild-type protein. Removal of the A domain does not significantly alter helicase activity, and if the HTH domain is additionally removed then a significant stimulation is observed, in agreement with the results for ATPase activity described above.

As with full-length Sso MCM, the AAA+ core domain was capable of melting both Y-shaped and 3&#x02032; tailed substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). However, and in marked contrast to the behaviour of the full-length MCM, the isolated AAA+ core domain construct was able to catalyse melting of a 5&#x02032; tailed construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). We note that the absolute level of product detected with the 5&#x02032; tailed construct plateaus at approximately 25% of the level detected with 3&#x02032; tailed and Y-shaped substrates. This activity is abrogated by the introduction of a Walker A (K-A) mutation in the core domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C), allowing us to rule out trivial explanations of contaminating helicases in our MCM core domain preparation.

First, deletion of the N-terminal domains and the HTH could uncover a cryptic 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; helicase activity of the MCM. A second possibility is that the truncated construct is still acting as a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; helicase, but is able to engage with the 3&#x02032; ends of the substrate either in the context of a double-strand end or 3&#x02032; recessed end. To test this latter possibility, we examined whether the Sso MCM or AAA+ domain could mediate melting of a duplex substrate lacking single-stranded tails. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D, while the full-length protein cannot melt this substrate, the AAA+ core domain can do so efficiently; as with the 5&#x02032; tailed substrate, this activity is abrogated by the introduction of Walker A (K-A) mutation in the AAA+ core construct.</p><p>Work on Mth MCM has indicated that deletion of parts of that protein could result in filamentation of the truncated protein. It was, therefore, formally possible that the apparent helicase activity we observe could in fact be due to nucleation of filamentous polymerisation of the MCM AAA+ core domain along a single strand of DNA, thereby displacing the other strand. We believe that this is unlikely because the core domain construct is dimeric in solution and the Walker A mutant is devoid of DNA melting activity. Nevertheless, we tested whether ATP hydrolysis was required for the observed melting of duplex DNA. To do this, we incubated the core domain with either ATP, a non-hydrolysable analog, AMP-PNP, ADP or the hydrolysis transition state analog, ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub>. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E, only ATP is able to facilitate unwinding of duplex DNA by the AAA+ core domain.</p><p>Although we cannot rule out the formal possibility that the AAA+ core domain possesses a novel 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; activity in addition to 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; helicase activity, we believe that the above data indicate that the ability of the AAA+ core domain construct to unwind a 5&#x02032; tailed substrate most likely arises from the protein's ability to engage with a 3&#x02032; end in the context of a double-stranded end, then proceed in an ATP-dependent manner in the conventional 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; polarity. It may be significant that, as Sso MCM is from a hyperthermophilic organism, we perform the helicase assays at 50&#x000b0;C. This may lead to transient melting of base pairs at the DNA double-strand end, facilitating engagement by the core AAA+ domains.</p></sec><sec><title>The N-terminal processivity clamp</title><p>Finally, because our gel filtration, affinity pull down and EMSA data indicate that there is functional interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains, we tested the effect of adding back the N-half construct in <italic>trans</italic> on the helicase activity of the core AAA+ domain. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, the N-half protein stimulates the helicase activity of the AAA+ domain on a 3&#x02032; tailed substrate. Similar results were obtained with a Y-shaped substrate (data not shown). This stimulation is specific to the N-half protein, as addition of either BSA or isolated HTH had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and data not shown). It should be noted that the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B indicate that when the N-half and core domain are present in their natural <italic>cis</italic> configuration (-HTH construct), considerably higher activity is detectable, presumably reflective of the relatively weak interaction between these domains in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). No helicase activity was detected upon addition of N-half to the Walker A mutant AAA+ domain (data not shown). We and others have shown previously that the N-half contains a DNA binding site in the form of a &#x003b2;-hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We made point mutations in the isolated N-terminal domain construct, changing the conserved lysine and arginine residues at the tip of the hairpin to alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). EMSA assays confirmed that this mutant derivative had lost the ability to bind DNA (data not shown). Addition of the resultant protein showed no stimulation of helicase activity, indicating the importance of the N-terminal DNA binding site in stimulating the activity of the core domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). We next tested the effect of adding back the N-half protein to the range of substrates that could be unwound by the core domain. Significantly, addition of the N-half protein resulted in clear inhibition of the ability of the AAA+ core domains to unwind both non-tailed duplex and 5&#x02032; tailed substrates. We then tested the effect of the addition of DNA-binding-defective N-half on the ability of the core domain to melt 5&#x02032; tailed and flush duplex substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C and D). In contrast to the result obtained with 3&#x02032; tailed or Y-shaped substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B), we saw essentially identical inhibition of core-domain-mediated helicase activity with both wild-type and DNA binding defective N-half. This observation allows us to rule out the trivial explanation that the N-half is simply blocking access to the DNA substrate by the core domain by virtue of its higher DNA binding affinity. Thus, we can discriminate two mechanistically distinct consequences of interaction of the N-half with the core domain; first, a DNA-binding-independent inhibition of the ability to use 5&#x02032; tailed and flush duplex substrates and, second, a DNA-binding-dependent stimulation of 3&#x02032; tail dependent helicase activity.</p><p>In light of our data showing cooperative DNA binding of N- and C-terminal halves of MCM and the dependence of the stimulatory effect of the N-half on its ability to bind DNA, we speculated, therefore, that the addition of the N-half may facilitate productive interaction of the complex with DNA. We, therefore, wished to test the processivity of the complex. To this end, we performed helicase assays with an M13 template that had a variety of lengths of duplex DNA annealed. To quantify the ability of the MCM to remain template committed, we measured the relative ratio of long versus short strands displaced from the substrate. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D, addition of the N-half significantly enhances the relative yield of longer products, a result compatible with the N-half assisting the template commitment of the core domain. Addition of N-half protein containing point mutations in the DNA-binding &#x003b2;-hairpin did not result in a similar stimulation of processivity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our data reveal the functional modules that make up the Sso MCM and the complex net of interactions linking them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). We have defined the AAA+ module as the minimal domain required for both helicase and ATPase activities. Previous studies using the Mth MCM were unable to test this directly due to an inability to express this domain in isolation. Our gel filtration and glutaraldehyde crosslinking data indicate that the AAA+ domain is capable of forming a range of multimeric forms. The helicase activity of the isolated AAA+ domain suggests that it is capable of forming the active hexameric complex in the presence of substrate. This may be similar to the situation found in other AAA+ family members that only achieve their full oligomeric status in the presence of their target.
<fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Summary of interactions detected within the MCM complex. The dotted lines indicate that the N-half-core interactions could be occurring in <italic>cis</italic> and/or <italic>trans</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl1117f8"/></fig></p><p>The presence of the N-half, although not essential, is clearly stimulatory to the 3&#x02032; end dependent helicase activity of the AAA+ domain. This is evident either when the domains are covalently joined or mixed together as isolated fragments. Previously, the highly stable double hexameric nature of the N-terminal half of Mth MCM had implicated it as the organising centre of the complex. However, we find that the exactly analogous region of Sso MCM forms a range of lower-order multimeric forms in solution, suggesting that the stable formation of a double hexamer is not key to the role of the N-half in SsoMCM. Overall, we find evidence for four interfaces within the Sso complex: N-half to N-half, AAA+ to AAA+, HTH to HTH and N-half to AAA+, suggesting a more distributed pattern of complex formation than that seen in Mth MCM.</p><p>The isolated AAA+ domain has a Kd greater than 65&#x02009;&#x000b5;M by EMSA compared to a Kd of around 12&#x02009;&#x000b5;M for the N-half. However, a synergistic effect was seen in the presence of both domains. Relative to the isolated N-half, a fivefold increase was seen for a mix of the separate fragments and a 65-fold increase was seen for the covalently linked domains. This indicates that both sets of DNA binding sites are able to bind simultaneously, presenting an extended interface for interaction and reducing the probability of dissociation. This, combined with the ring structure of the hexamer topologically linking MCM to its track, would result in a highly stable complex. However, an independent DNA binding site from that necessary for helicase progression could conceivably have a detrimental effect, perhaps acting like a brake. The interaction between the motor domain and the N-half opens the possibility of dynamic communication of these two domains, potentially influencing the relative positioning of their DNA binding domains. In this light, it may be significant that we have recently described mutations in the N-terminal DNA-binding &#x003b2;-hairpin that prevent DNA-mediated stimulation of MCM ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This proposed interplay between N-terminal domains and the ATPase domain may be reflected in our observation of N-half-mediated repression of helicase activity on 5&#x02032;-tailed and flush duplex substrates.</p><p>The formation of a double hexamer has been suggested to be critical to the function of Mth MCM at the origin, analogous to the situation seen with the SV40 LTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Our data indicate that Sso MCM can also form higher-order complexes, presumably including this species. Its existence seems dependant on the presence of the most peripheral domains, the A domain of the N-half and the C-terminal HTH domain, neither of which are at the hexamer&#x02013;hexamer interface seen in the crystal structure of Mth MCM. The yeast <italic>bob1</italic> mutation, which deregulates initiation, results in a change of the orientation of the A domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). An EM comparison of the N-half and full-length Mth MCM also shows a large realignment of the A domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Other structural studies suggest that the A and HTH domains are close to each other in space, possibly allowing a physical interaction between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This suggests a model in which formation of the double hexamer, and thus initiation, is controlled by the position of the A domain relative to the rest of the N-half, which in turn is regulated by the HTH domain. Further evidence of the regulatory properties of the HTH domain comes from the enhancement of helicase and ATPase activity upon its deletion. Interestingly, a recent study of Mth MCM has also revealed that removal of the HTH domain stimulates the DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities of the Mth protein, suggesting that the repressive nature of the HTH may be a general feature of MCMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>These results support the idea of the AAA+ domain as a coherent module that supplies the driving force for helicase action, with other domains recruited to optimise or regulate it. This observation is presumably reflective of the evolutionary derivation of the MCM helicase. The progenitor form of the protein may have been the AAA+ domain in isolation that then associated with additional partners to enhance its intrinsic activity. During the course of evolution, gene fusion events may have occurred that &#x0201c;locked&#x0201d; these domains together. In this regard, we have recently described a bacteriophage-encoded protein that has a eukaryal primase domain fused to an MCM ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Our finding in the current work that the N-terminal domains augment the processivity of the AAA+ helicase activity is reminiscent of the function of molecules such as the bacterial &#x003b2;-clamp and archaeo-eukaryal PCNA. Indeed, this analogy has already been proposed, based on gross structural similarities between the ring shapes of sliding clamps and the Mth MCM N-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Sliding clamps enhance the processivity of DNA polymerases and additionally serve as docking sites for further accessory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). We believe that this analogy is further strengthened by our observation that the <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> GINS complex binds to the N-terminal domains of Sso MCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to James Chong for communicating work prior to publication and for informative discussions.

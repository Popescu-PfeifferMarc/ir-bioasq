The aim of the present study was to determine the optimal intensity and interval of repeated 100 Hz TENS for the treatment of chronic inflammatory hyperalgesia in a monoarthritic pain model of the rat, and to assess the changes of the spinal substance P (SP) release in response to TENS treatment. A reliable, reproducible chronic monoarthritic pain model was produced by intra-articular injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) at single ankle joint. The efficacy of 100 Hz TENS treatments with different frequencies and intensities was compared. In the acute period (within 3 weeks) of monoarthritis, twice-a-week schedule of TENS reduced the swelling of the inflamed ankle significantly. In the stable period (4&#x02013;9 weeks), however, once-a-week schedule produced a significantly better therapeutic effect on both inflammation and arthritic hyperalgesia than that of twice- or five-times-a-week schedule. Using three levels of intensity of TENS, we found that the weaker (1-1-2 mA) stimulation produced significantly better therapeutic effects. Repeated TENS produced a reduction of SP content in spinal perfusate in parallel with the progressive reduction of the arthritic pain scores. Our results suggest that (i) consecutive TENS treatments produced cumulative effect for chronic hyperalgesia, (ii) for chronic inflammatory hyperalgesia, a weaker intensity and more sparsely arranged treatment schedule may produce better therapeutic effect and (iii) a decrease in SP release may serve as one of the possible neurochemical mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of multiple TENS treatments on chronic inflammatory hyperalgesia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chronic inflammatory hyperalgesia</kwd><kwd>Freund's adjuvant</kwd><kwd>monoarthritis</kwd><kwd>substance P</kwd><kwd>transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pain is one of the most serious medical problems encountered today. Chronic pain, characterized by its long duration, slow recovery and difficulty to control in clinical practice, makes it even more serious than acute pain both physically and psychologically. It is thus an imperative and formidable task for researchers to demonstrate the mechanisms of chronic pain and find effective therapy for its treatment. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which has been developed in the past 30 years, is now being used more and more extensively for pain relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Early studies of TENS-induced analgesia mainly focused on the immediate effect induced by single treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). It has been demonstrated that frequency, intensity, electrode placement and pulse duration are the important impact factors on the TENS effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). However, clinical data indicate that repeated electrical stimulation could produce cumulative (long-term) effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The optimal parameters found from acute tests may not be applicable in cases with chronic pain. It has drawn more and more attention to find the suitable parameters for the therapeutic efficacy of multiple TENS treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). Among many factors, the less well-characterized parameter is the time interval between two consecutive sessions of TENS, which played an important role in the outcome of long-term effect in normal rats (W. Xu, PhD thesis, Department of Physiology, Beijing Medical University, Beijing, China, 1995). In the present study, we characterized the optimal interval and intensity of repeated 100 Hz TENS for the treatment of chronic hyperalgesia induced by injecting a small amount of water-in-oil type complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into single ankle joint in rats.</p><p>A great deal of evidence indicates that substance P (SP) as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator is involved in the transmission of nociceptive signals in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). It has been shown that SP release in spinal cord and peripheral tissue was increased during the development of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and that TENS or acupuncture might alter the noxious nerve stimulation-induced release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) of SP in the spinal cord, which may be frequency dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Whether spinal SP release was altered by repeated 100 Hz TENS was also characterized in the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Rats</title><p>Wistar female rats obtained from the Experimental Animal Research Center, Peking University, were used throughout the study. They arrived at a weight of 150&#x02013;200 g, were housed 4&#x02013;6 rats per cage with sawdust bedding and given food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Experiments were conducted according to the Ethical Guidelines for Investigation of Experimental Pain in Conscious Animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and were approved by the local ethics committee for animal research of Peking University.</p><p>Indices obtained in the present study were observed and measured by one of the authors (H.-X. L.) throughout the experiments to avoid interobserver differences.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of Monoarthritis</title><sec><title>Preparation of Water-in-Oil Type CFA</title><p>Two 1 ml syringes were used, one filled with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) (0.85 ml paraffin oil mixed with 0.15 ml Aracel A in 1 ml, Gibco Company), and another with equal volume of suspension of killed <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Human strain, 20 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, Chinese Inspection Institute for Biological Materials, Beijing). They were interconnected with each other through a plastic catheter of &#x0223c;6 cm long. Careful attention was paid to avoid air bubbles in the catheter and syringes. The pistons of the two syringes were pushed alternately until thick water-in-oil emulsion was formed. The preparation of the control IFA was the same as that for CFA with the exception that the suspension of killed <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was substituted with normal saline.</p></sec><sec><title>Intra-articular Injection</title><p>Intra-articular injection to the tibio&#x02013;tarsal joint was performed as described by Butler <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with 10% chlorohydrate (300 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, i.p.). Freund's adjuvant (30 &#x003bc;l) was injected into the right ankle joint through a 26<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-gauge needle inserted into the articular cavity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation</title><p>The monoarthritic rats were restrained in a specially designed holder with the hind legs and tail exposed. The hair on the lower legs was removed with saturated barium sulfide (BaS) solution and rinsed thoroughly with water. After wiping and drying the legs, two pairs of round platinum electrodes (5 mm diameter) were attached tightly on both legs, one on the normal saline wetted skin of Zusanli (ST36, the lateral side of the anterior tibial tubercle of the leg at the level between upper one-third and lower two-third of the tibia) and another on the medial side at the same level to form a circuitry. The Eight channel HANS stimulator used was manufactured by the Beijing Medical University. The parameters for TENS output were as follows: 0.2 ms pulse width, 100 Hz frequency and 30 min duration per session. The intensity of stimulation was arranged at three levels as follows: weak (1-1-2 mA), medium (1-2-3 mA) or high (2-3-4 mA), with current increasing stepwise, each step lasting for 10 min. For mock stimulation, the skin electrodes were placed on the same regions but no current was delivered. To find the optimal interval of TENS treatment, once-a-week, twice-a-week or five-times-a-week schedule was used with the medium intensity stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Indices for Behavioral Observations</title><p>Behavioral observations included body weight, circumferences of the ankle joints bilaterally, leg-withdrawal threshold and scores of arthritic flexion (both plantar and dorsal flexion) pain test. The rats were weighed before putting in the holder. The other measurements were made 30 min after the rats were restrained. These measurements were taken once-a-week before TENS treatment with the observation time allocated in the morning between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 noontime.</p><sec><title>Measurement of Ankle Circumference</title><p>The circumferences of the ankles were measured around the lower edge of lateral and medial malleolus with a flexible ruler without elasticity.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Leg-withdrawal Threshold</title><p>Randall&#x02013;Selitto response was determined with continuously increasing pressure applied on one side of the ankle joint. The value of pressure (mm Hg) was recorded at the withdrawal of the leg. The mean value of two measurements with a 30 min interval was taken as the final result of the paw withdrawal threshold. The threshold of the contralateral side was examined 15 min later.</p></sec><sec><title>Scoring of Arthritic Flexion Pain Test</title><p>The ankle joint was gently flexed to the plantar direction for 5 times with an interval of 5 s. The same manipulation was used and the force onto the ankle was monitored by the color change of the thumb fingertip induced by blockade of blood circulation. The leg-withdrawal scores were measured, respectively. It was scored zero when rats showed no quick leg-withdrawal; scored 1 when the brisk withdrawal reaction appeared. A total leg-withdrawal score was obtained between 0 and 5 for each test session. The same scoring method was employed for dorsal flexion test, which was proceeded to the extent that the toes touched the front of the leg.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>X-ray Examinations</title><p>Radiographic evaluation (40 kV, 2 ms) was performed under light anesthesia based on whole body radiographs and coned-down views of the hind limbs.</p></sec><sec><title>Radioimmunoassay of SP</title><p>Rats were anesthetized with chlorohydrate. A PE-10 catheter was inserted into the subarachnoid space through the cisterna magna with the tip reaching the level of lumbar spinal enlargement. Another piece of polyethylene tube (PE-50) was inserted 10 mm down the cisterna. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid contained bacitracin (30 mg l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), a peptidase inhibitor, was perfused at a rate of 1.0 ml per 30 min with a push&#x02013;pull pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The spinal perfusate (1.0 ml) was collected in the Eppendorf vials immersed in an ice-water bath and then heated for 10 min in boiling water bath. After cooling down to room temperature, the perfusate was centrifuged at 10&#x02009;000 g for 10 min. Supernatants were lyophilized and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The lyophilized perfusate was reconstituted in 250 &#x003bc;l H<sub>2</sub>O for the radioimmunoassay (RIA) of SP. <sup>125</sup>I-SP RIA kits were bought from the Basic Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing. The SP antiserum showed no detectable cross-reactivity with ACTH, angiotensin II and Met-enkephalin, &#x0003c;0.01% with eledoisin, &#x0003c;0.008% with eledoisin-related peptides. The non-specific binding rate was 6.18%, total binding 35.8% and IC<sub>50</sub> 112 fmol per tube. Standards (or samples) (100 &#x003bc;l), SP antiserum (1:6500, 100 &#x003bc;l) and [<sup>125</sup>I]SP (10000 dpm, 100 &#x003bc;l) were added to the polyethylene test tubes, mixed thoroughly and then incubated for 72 h at 4&#x000b0;C. For the separation of bound from free peptide, 1 ml 0.5% Dextran-T70-wrapped active carbon was added into the above assay system while mixed in an ice-water bath. The mixtures were centrifuged for 20 min at 1750 g, 4&#x000b0;C following 10 min of standstill on bench. The supernatants were counted using micro-&#x003b3;-counter.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Processing and Statistical Analyses</title><p>The results were presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM for continuous data (body weight, ankle circumference, withdrawal threshold of pressure to ankle, content of SP-ir) or as median &#x000b1; median-derived absolute deviation (MAD) for the non-parametric data (pain scores). Continuous data were processed with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan's test. For the discrete data (pain scores), Friedman ANOVA (repeated measures ANOVA on ranks) was used to analyze the change of pain scores with the time course within the group, Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis ANOVA (one-way ANOVA on ranks) followed by Dunn's test or Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test for the comparison between the groups at the same time point.

In the period from second week through ninth week, the levels of SP-ir in rats that received TENS treatments were significantly lower than that of the control group (two-way ANOVA, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>D).</p><p><italic>Weight-normalized contents of SP-ir in the spinal perfusate.</italic> In order to exclude the influence of the body weight on the contents of SP-ir, we normalized the content of SP-ir according to the regression equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>D) as follows: weight-normalized content of SP-ir = actual content + 0.2557 [body weight (g) &#x02212; 200], where 0.2557 is the regression coefficient and 200 is about the average body weight at the beginning of the experiment. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>F. In the control rat, there was an abrupt decrease in SP-ir 1 week after the injection of CFA, and then returned to and remained approximately at the level of na&#x000ef;ve rats. In the TENS group, there was a mild but significant decrease in SP-ir content, remaining there for the whole observation period of 9 weeks. Comparison between the two curves in the period from second week to ninth week after the injection of CFA showed a statistically significant difference (two-way ANOVA, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In our selection of an inflammatory pain model, we considered various options. The adjuvant-induced polyarthritis has been widely used for the study of chronic arthritic pain since its introduction in 1956 by Pearson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, the general health condition in these animals could be very bad because of the widespread immunological lesions. Thus, it brings about many biochemical, physiological and behavioral disorders besides pain.</p><p>Butler <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) developed a monoarthritic pain model with long-term joint hyperalgesia by injecting CFA via intra-articular route of administration. Following Butler <italic>et al</italic>.'s procedure using a water-in-oil type CFA, a monoarthritic model was produced in the present study, which fulfilled the following criteria: (i) clear manifestation of joint hyperalgesia, (ii) hyperalgesia was maintained at a plateau for at least 6&#x02013;9 weeks, (iii) minimal destruction of bone tissue and (iv) no severe change in general health. The general condition of the animals was quite good as shown by the steady increase in body weight. The arthritis manifested two distinct stages. There appeared acute redness and swelling of the joint within hours after the articular injection, which peaked in 24 h and subsided in the third week, whereas the joint hyperalgesia maintained for at least six more weeks. X-ray examinations and pathological study revealed no significant change in the bone density around the site of injection. Thus, it appears to be a convenient model for the study of both acute (in the first 3 weeks) and chronic (4&#x02013;9 weeks after inoculation) inflammatory hyperalgesia.</p><p>The theoretical basis of TENS was established mainly on the gate control concept developed by Melzack and Wall in 1965 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), which suggests that activation of large diameter mechanoceptive fibers will presynaptically inhibit the activity of small caliber nociceptive afferents. According to this theory, the optimal sites for placing TENS electrodes should be chosen at the same segmental region as that of the noxious input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25 B26">23&#x02013;26</xref>), and the optimal parameters for TENS should be of low intensity and high frequency for preferential excitation of the large diameter fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Indeed, this has been referred to as &#x02018;conventional TENS&#x02019; and extensively used in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In contrast to the conventional TENS, electroacupuncture (EA) has often been described as a peripheral conditioning stimulation of high intensity and low frequency, which is delivered heterosegmentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). However, Wang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) found no significant difference in producing antinociception between EA and TENS at three different levels of frequencies (2, 15 and 100 Hz). It was also found that EA and TENS exhibited a profound cross-tolerance when the same frequency was applied, indicating that a similar neurochemical mechanisms may underlie both EA and TENS analgesia. The systemic study on the specificity of acupoint in normal rats using electrophysiological methods showed that the effect of EA was determined by the intensity of EA stimulation, such that weak EA produced a segmental analgesia, while strong EA produced a generalized analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). TENS may also act through modulating descending influences from supraspinal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Multiple studies have shown that the frequency of TENS stimulation is an important factor for its efficacy on inflammatory hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34 B35 B36 B37">32&#x02013;37</xref>) and mechanisms underlying the effects of high (&#x0003e;50 Hz) and low (&#x0003c;10 Hz) frequency stimulation are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). We have compared the effects of low (2 Hz) and high (100 Hz) frequency of repeated TENS on the chronic inflammatory hyperalgesia and found that 100 Hz TENS produced better therapeutic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in the present study we use high frequency (100 Hz) TENS and placed the skin electrodes near the inflammatory region to assure a full extent analgesic effect when different intensities and intervals of TENS were used.</p><p>It has been generally accepted that the activation of large diameter (A&#x003b1;, A&#x003b2;) afferent fibers would produce a segmental antinociceptive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), whereas high intensity (noxious) stimulation would also activate small diameter (A&#x003b4;, C) fibers to produce diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In normal rats, peripheral stimulation of 1&#x02013;3 mA can produce an intensity-dependent increase in tail flick latency, i.e. the higher the intensity, the stronger the analgesic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41">39&#x02013;41</xref>). However, Zhu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) found that in rats with sciatic nerve injury or arthritis, higher intensity EA did not produce a more potent analgesic effect as compared with the low intensity stimulation. In the present study, high intensity (2-3-4 mA) stimulation produced little analgesic effect in contrast to the reduction of pain scoring in the low intensity (1-1-2 mA) group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>What then are the possible mechanisms underlying this seemingly paradoxical phenomenon? It has been revealed that a series of plastic changes occurred in animals with nerve injury or tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45 B46">43&#x02013;46</xref>). In the inflammatory rat model, there was an increase in the affinity of the opioid receptor and an increase in the excitability of the afferent nerve fibers not only in the spinal dorsal horn but also in many other regions of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). There was also an increase in the spontaneous discharge of the spino-thalamic neurons in rats with chronic sciatic nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). One may postulate that the signals induced by EA or TENS may be put through more easily when there is an increase in the excitability of the relevant nerve pathway, so that a weak stimulation is now recognized and processed as a moderate stimulation to produce a proper therapeutic effect, whereas a strong stimulation would be perceived as a suprastrong stimuli thereby exacerbate the hyperalgesia and allodynia. The activation of large diameter primary afferents from deep somatic tissues, not cutaneous tissues, is important in causing TENS analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><p>The effects of multiple TENS have drawn significant attentions to the researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Among many factors, how frequently TENS treatments need to be given for the best outcome is less studied. In the present study we made systemic observations on the therapeutic effects of three different intervals of repeated 100 Hz TENS on the acute and stable period of CFA-induced monoarthritis, and found that for the treatment of acute period of monoarthritis (Weeks 1&#x02013;3), the optimal interval is twice-a-week; while in the stable period (Weeks 4&#x02013;9), once-a-week schedule appears to produce better therapeutic effect. When TENS was administered too frequently (five-times-a-week), no therapeutic effect was observed and the swelling of the inflamed ankle may even be aggravated.</p><p>Fu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) used repeated acupuncture stimulations for the treatment of experimental gastric ulcer in rats, and found that every-other-day treatment was the most effective schedule for accelerating the healing of the ulcer. Using weak EA for the treatment of neuropathic pain in the rat it was found that once a day or once every-other-day was most effective to suppress hyperalgesia and allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Wu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) used 2/100 Hz TENS for the treatment of heroin withdrawal syndrome in drug addicts and found that in the first 2&#x02013;3 days of drug abstinence, 3&#x02013;4 treatments (30 min each) a day were needed to secure best results, which could then be reduced to 3 and then 2 treatments per day in the rest of the 2 week detoxification period. It has also been reported that permanent press auricular acupuncture retained <italic>in situ</italic> for 1 day after surgery reduces the post-operative analgesic requirement after ambulatory knee arthroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the data indicate that diseases with acute syndrome need more frequent EA or TENS treatments as compared with chronic stage which may require more sparse treatments for best therapeutic effect. Also this may help to avoid developing TENS tolerance induced by frequent (daily) treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Involvement of SP in the TENS Treatment on Inflammatory Hyperalgesia</title><p>To study the mechanisms of the therapeutic effect of TENS treatment on inflammatory hyperalgesia, we focused on the possible role played by SP in spinal cord in monoarthritic rats. SP immunoreactivity (SP-ir) in spinal perfusate was measured using RIA. Since the SP converting enzyme does not show an increased activity during the period of arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>), the decreased level of SP-ir in spinal perfusate observed in the present study could be taken as an index for the decreased rate of SP release from the central nervous system, especially from the spinal cord.</p><p>Given that the negative correlation between the content of SP-ir in the spinal perfusate and the body weight in na&#x000ef;ve rats, which has also been shown in other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>), may serve as the reason of the rundown of the SP-ir contents observed during the TENS treatments, we normalized the SP-ir content in spinal perfusate to exclude the impact of the animal growth (body weight increase) during the observation period of more than 2 months. An abrupt decrease in SP-ir in spinal perfusate was observed 1 week after CFA inoculation in the control rats without TENS, which is consistent with the findings obtained in spinal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Also, Sluka and Westlund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) reported that during the acute experimental arthritis induced by injection of kaolin and carrageenan into the knee joint there was an initial depletion of SP contents in spinal dorsal horn, presumably because of a massive release of SP from the primary afferents. This may result in a depletion of SP at the spinal dorsal horn, leading to an abrupt decrease in SP-ir in spinal perfusate mentioned above.</p><p>It is interesting to note that this abrupt decrease in SP-ir was not observed in the rats receiving TENS treatment. This can be due to (i) the amelioration of inflammatory process by TENS treatment so that the inflammation-induced increase in the central SP release was not so dramatic as in the control group without TENS treatment; (ii) the suppression of SP release from the central terminal of primary afferent by the activation of large diameter afferent fiber through gate control mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Taking the circumference of the ankle joint as an index of the ankle swelling, namely the severity of arthritis, it was obvious that no significant difference was found between the groups with and without TENS at the first week, suggesting that the inflammatory process was not significantly affected by TENS, which is obviously not in favor of the first explanation.</p><p>Starting from the second week to the ninth week, the level of SP-ir in the TENS group was significantly lower than the control group, which was in parallel with the temporal course of a significant decrease in pain scores in TENS group. This decrease was obvious in the second week in contrast to the significant improvement in joint swelling occurred only from the seventh week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>B and C). Moreover, compared with the strong analgesic effect, the anti-inflammatory effect of TENS as revealed by the reduction of joint swelling is relatively weak. The results appear in favor of the hypothesis that a low intensity transcutaneous electric stimulation (1&#x02013;2 mA) can produce a marked reduction of chronic hyperalgesia, accompanying with a suppression of the release of SP in the spinal cord. This is similar to the finding that single session TENS (50 Hz, 50 V, 5 min) shows analgesic effects by reducing the production of SP in both the dorsal root ganglion and dorsal horn of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). This may add to the emerging evidences that some of the analgesic effects of TENS and acupuncture may be mediated through the alteration of neurotransmitters release, e.g. the release of aspartate, glutamate, glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>) and serotonergic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>), as well as the receptor expression, e.g. the opioid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), alpha2A adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>) and muscarinic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC, 30330230).

Six series of experiments were performed in 13 groups. Behavioral indices were measured and then spinal perfusion was conducted at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 weeks after CFA injection. One group of na&#x000ef;ve rats served as control. 100 Hz TENS was administered once-a-week started at 24 h after the injection of CFA. The intensity of stimulation was increased from 1 mA to a maximal of 2 mA for 30 min. Behavioral measurements were performed only once for each group prior to spinal perfusion. The inflamed ankles of rats received TENS treatments had a lower level of ankle swelling (A) and lower sensitivity to flexion pain tests (B and C).

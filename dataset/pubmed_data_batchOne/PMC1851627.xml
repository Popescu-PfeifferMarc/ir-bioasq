The dipstick assay offers about 10 times higher detectability than agarose gel electrophoresis and, contrary to electrophoresis, allows confirmation of the sequence of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product by hybridization within a few minutes without the need of instrumentation. Biotinylated amplified DNA is hybridized with a dA-tailed probe and applied to the strip, which contains oligo(dT)-conjugated gold nanoparticles in dry form. Upon immersion of the strip in the appropriate buffer, the solution migrates and the hybrids are captured by immobilized streptavidin at the test zone generating a characteristic red line. The excess nanoparticles are captured by oligo(dA) strands immobilized at the control zone of the strip producing a second red line. We studied the: t(9;22)(q34;q11), t(15;17)(q22;q21), t(11;17)(q23;q21), t(5;17)(q32;q21), t(11;17)(q13;q21), t(8,21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13;q22) that generate the BCR-ABL, PML-RARa, PLZF-RARa, NPM-RARa, NuMA-RARa, AML1-ETO and CBF&#x003b2;-MYH11 fusion genes, respectively. A single K562 cell was detectable amidst 10<sup>6</sup> normal leukocytes. A dipstick test was developed for actin, as a reference gene. The dipstick assay with appropriate probes can be used for identification of the fusion transcripts involved in the translocation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chromosomal translocations have a primary role in the pathogenesis of leukemia because they affect specific genes encoding transcription factors or other cell-cycle regulators. The structural and functional characterization of these rearrangements has provided valuable insight into the mechanisms of malignant transformation of the hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Moreover, the fusion genes that are formed as a result of the translocations constitute important tumor markers whose detection and/or quantification assist in the diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring the response to treatment and detection of minimal residual disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). The chimeric proteins that are encoded by the fusion genes in the leukemic cells could in principle serve as tumor markers but there is a lack of suitable antibodies for the development of immunoassays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) are used widely for the detection of chromosomal rearrangements albeit their sensitivity is limited to 1&#x02013;5% of leukemic cells in the total cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). To date the highest detectability is achieved by methods that are based on the exponential amplification of translocation-specific nucleic acid sequences, e.g. via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Molecular studies of chromosomal rearrangements have shown that the breakpoints in various patients are spread over a large segment of genomic DNA, which is difficult to amplify by PCR on a routine basis. The resulting fusion mRNA transcripts, however, are the same in most patients and consequently RNA is preferred as a starting template for the molecular assays of chromosomal translocations (1&#x02013;6). PCR primers are designed to hybridize at opposite sides of the junction region so that exponential amplification occurs only when the fusion sequence is present in the sample.</p><p>Currently, the most widely used method for the detection of PCR products entails separation by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. Hybridization assays that are performed in microtitration wells have been proposed for the post-PCR detection of amplified products because they are easily automatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, they require specialized instrumentation and multiple pipetting, incubation and washing steps in order to capture the amplified sequence, hybridize with a specific probe, remove the excess of probe, add the appropriate substrate and read the generated signal. Alternatively, flow cytometry can be used for post-PCR detection of amplification products that are fluorescently labeled or have been subjected to an oligonucleotide ligation reaction and are captured on polystyrene beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Flow cytometry is suitable for the development of multiplex assays but requires expensive instrumentation. On the other hand, real-time PCR allows continuous monitoring of the amplified fragments during PCR by a homogeneous fluorometric hybridization assay and is used widely for quantification of the fusion transcripts. Real-time PCR, however, requires highly specialized, expensive equipment along with costly reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we report the first dry-reagent, disposable, dipstick test for the molecular screening of chromosomal translocations. The test allows visual detection and confirmation of PCR-amplified leukemia-specific transcripts by hybridization within minutes. The test is simple and does not require special instrumentation. A total of seven well-defined chromosomal rearrangements were selected. The Philadelphia translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11), which is present in &#x0003e;95% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), involves the movement of most of the ABL (Abelson murine leukemia) protooncogene from chromosome 9 to the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22, thus resulting in the BCR-ABL fusion gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The t(15;17)(q22;q21) translocation, which is the diagnostic hallmark of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), joins the PML (promyelocytic leukemia) gene on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (RARa) on 17q to produce the PML-RARa fusion gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Three other chromosomal translocations, associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), disrupt the RARa gene, namely, the t(11;17)(q23;q21) that involves the PLZF (promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger) gene, the t(5;17)(q32;q21) implicating the NPM (nucleophosmin) gene and the t(11;17)(q13;q21) that involves the gene encoding the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA). The generated fusion transcripts are PLZF-RARa, NPM-RARa and NuMA-RARa, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Also two other common translocations with a significant prognostic value for AML were detected: The t(8,21)(q22;q22), that fuses the acute myeloid leukaemia 1 (AML1) gene with the ETO (eight twenty one) gene (generating the AML1-ETO fusion gene) and the inv(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>)(p13;q22) that joins the CBF&#x003b2; (core binding factor beta) gene on 16q22 and the MYH11 (myosin smooth muscle heavy chain) gene on chromosome 16p13 to produce the CBF&#x003b2;-MYH11 fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Instrumentation</title><p>PCR amplification was performed in a thermal cycler from MJ Research (Waltham, MA).

Gold nanoparticles (40&#x02009;nm diameter) functionalized with poly(dT) strands, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), were placed on the conjugate pad and allowed to dry at room temperature.

PCR II products were biotinylated at the one end by using an upstream primer labeled with biotin at the 5&#x02032; end. The sizes of PCR II products were 200&#x02009;bp for BCR-ABL b3-a2 transcript, 124&#x02009;bp for BCR-ABL b2-a2, 366&#x02009;bp for PML-RARa, 267&#x02009;bp for PLZF-RARa, 423&#x02009;bp for NPM-RARa, 315&#x02009;bp for NuMA-RARa, 260&#x02009;bp for AML1-ETO and 271&#x02009;bp for CBF&#x003b2;-MYH11. The integrity of extracted total RNA was confirmed by RT-PCR (one round) of actin mRNA, as a reference gene. The PCR product of actin was 372 bp. A similar dry-reagent dipstick assay was also developed for the detection of actin amplification product.</p><p>A schematic illustration of the dry-reagent dipstick test is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The assay entails rapid hybridization of the amplified fragments (target DNA), in solution, with a dATP-tailed oligonucleotide probe, application to the sample loading area on the conjugate pad of the strip and immersion of the strip (via the immersion pad) in the developing solution. The developing solution migrates to the opposite end of the strip, by capillary forces, and causes rehydration of the poly(dT)-functionalized gold nanoparticles (Au NP), which are then connected to the probe via hybridization of the poly(dT) strands with the poly(dA) tail of the probe. As the solution passes through the test zone of the strip, the hybrids are captured by immobilized streptavidin, thus resulting in accumulation of Au NP which is detected visually as a characteristic red line. The red color of the Au NP is due to the plasmon resonance peak at 520&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The excess of poly(dT)-Au NP are captured by immobilized poly(dA) strands at the control zone of the strip, giving a second red line. In the absence of the translocation, no red line is observed at the test zone. A red line, however, is always formed at the control zone to confirm the proper functioning of the strip. Consequently, a sample is positive for a certain translocation when a red line is observed both in the test and the control zone. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the conjugate pad (consisting of glass fibers) and the polyethersulfone membrane of the strip containing the Au NP are also presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.

The conventional way of performing this type of hybridization assays involves pipetting the sample on a streptavidin-coated solid phase (e.g. microtitration wells), incubation, washing the solid phase, addition of an appropriately labeled detection probe, incubation, washing out the excess of labeled probe and measuring the signal of the probe that is bound to the solid phase. The strip-based assay offers the following significant advantages: (a) It eliminates the multiple pipetting and washing steps required for addition of reagents and separation of the bound from the free labeled (not hybridized) probe. Indeed, the continuous migration of the developing solution along the strip allows rapid reagent mixing, hybridization, binding to the solid phase and efficient removal of the excess of labeled probe. (b) It provides an appropriate amount of Au NP- labeled probe in dry form as an integral part of the strip, thus eliminating the need for reconstitution of reagents and dilution of the stock solution.</p><p>The detectability of the dipstick assay was assessed, for each chromosomal translocation and for actin, by preparing solutions containing various concentrations of amplified DNA. The DNA concentration of each stock solution was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining followed by densitometric analysis of the picture of the gel taken by a digital camera. The <italic>&#x003d5;</italic> &#x000d7; 174 DNA markers were used as standards for the quantification. Afterwards, serial dilutions of the stock were prepared (using 67 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 16.6 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.1 ml/l Tween-20) and 10-&#x000b5;l aliquots containing from 0 to 400 fmol target DNA were assayed by the strip.</p></sec><sec><title>BCR-ABL translocation</title><p>The results for the BCR-ABL translocation are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. As low as 0.4 fmol of the amplified target DNA can be detected by visual observation. Furthermore, the intensity of the red line in the test zone of the strip increases as the amount of target DNA increases up to 100&#x02009;fmol (10 nM). At 400&#x02009;fmol target DNA (40&#x02009;nM), the intensity becomes lower than the line intensity at 100&#x02009;fmol DNA. This is attributed to the competition between reannealing of the two strands of target DNA and probe/target hybridization. A constant amount of 1 pmol poly(dA)-tailed probe was used throughout this work. The amount of probe was estimated experimentally and is determined by the number of poly(dT) strands on the surface of Au NP that are available for hybridization. The strip-based assay was compared directly (same amount of product) with agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The electropherograms are also presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The lowest amount of amplified DNA detectable by electrophoresis was 6.4&#x02009;fmol. Thus, the strip test for BCR-ABL amplified DNA provides 16 times better detectability than electrophoresis.

We first detect transcripts b3-a2 and b2-a2 by using probes b3-a2 and b2-a2, respectively. However, because these probes share a common sequence (specific to ABL exon 2) we observed significant cross-hybridization with the two transcripts. In order to identify, unambiguously, the type of the transcript involved, we designed a probe specific for BCR exon 3 (probe b3). The PCR products of the samples that were found positive with probes b3-a2 or b2-a2, were subjected to another dipstick assay using probe b3. Samples that contain the b3-a2 transcript give a positive result with the b3 probe, whereas samples that contain the b2-a2 transcript give no signal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows typical results of the dipstick assay (probe b3) for samples containing b3-a2 or b2-a2 transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>PML-RARa and AML1-ETO</title><p>The detection of the translocation PML-RARa was based on the analysis of the cell line NB4, one patient positive for the translocation and a patient negative for the translocation.

PCR is by far the most sensitive method for diagnosis, classification of risk groups and assessment of minimal residual disease during follow up. The detection of the type of translocation by a qualitative PCR assay is sufficient for the diagnosis and correct assignment of risk group. The gold standard for screening of these translocations is cytogenetics and PCR combined with agarose gel electrophoresis. For this reason, throughout this work, we compare the proposed dipstick assay directly to agarose gel electrophoresis. However, the evaluation of minimal residual disease is more challenging. A negative PCR result (absence of the fusion transcript in the sample) usually predicts a favorable outcome. On the other hand, if the screening test is positive (i.e. residual leukemic cells are present), this is not necessarily associated with a relapse. In this case, a quantitative PCR assay for the determination of the concentration of fusion transcripts over a period of time is a more reliable indicator of the progression of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The proposed dipstick assay is not a quantitative test but rather a rapid and cost-effective visual screening test before a decision for quantification is made. Nevertheless, we have analyzed five BCR-ABL samples by real-time PCR and the dipstick assay. The strips were then scanned and the intensity of the test zone was estimated densitometrically. The real-time PCR (Light cycler) values were 3.2, 173, 224, 992 and 7400, using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) as a reference gene. The dipstick assay gave 11, 133, 459, 394, 560, respectively. These results confirm that the dipstick assay should be used only for screening purposes.</p><p>The nested PCR-dipstick method can detect 1 K562 cell whereas the single PCR-dipstick assay detects 10 K562 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). It is well established in the literature (28&#x02013;30) that the sensitivity of real-time PCR is limited to about 10 or 100 K562 cells amidst 10<sup>6</sup> normal cells. Therefore, the sensitivity of the single PCR-dipstick test is similar to that of real-time PCR. Furthermore, the combination of nested PCR with the dipstick assay (although more laborious) provides a 10-fold improvement in sensitivity. This difference in sensitivity is important for clinical purposes because recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34">31&#x02013;34</xref>) state that complete remission in CML should be defined as negativity by nested PCR for BCR-ABL due to its superior sensitivity compared to real-time PCR. In recent studies for monitoring minimal residual disease, negative real-time PCR results need to be confirmed by nested PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34">31&#x02013;34</xref>).</p><p>A comparison of the single round PCR-dipstick method with the real-time PCR (two methods of similar sensitivity) in terms of cost and practicality reveals the following: (a) The dipstick method can be performed simply by using a classical PCR instrument that constitutes standard equipment of every molecular diagnosis laboratory. On the contrary, the investment cost for a real-time PCR instrument is over 10 times higher than classical PCR. (b) The cost of the probes used in real-time PCR (e.g. Taqman and FRET probes) is at least 7 times higher than the probes used in the proposed method. (c) The dry-reagent dipstick format eliminates the solution preparation steps, it is very simple to perform and minimizes the training of qualified personnel.</p><p>We estimated that the cost of the dipstick assay is less than 2 Euros. The dipstick assay offers about 10 times higher detectability than agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining and, contrary to electrophoresis, allows confirmation of the sequence of the PCR product by hybridization within a few minutes without the need of instrumentation. The dipstick assay requires PCR products that are biotinylated at the 5&#x02032; end (during PCR) along with a poly(dA)-tailed probe specific for the junction sequence. The dry-reagent disposable strip format greatly simplifies the assay because it eliminates the multiple incubation and washing steps performed in current hybridization assays.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by a University-Industry collaboration grant (EPAN) funded by the General Secreteriat of Research and Technology (GSRT) of Greece and by Medicon Hellas S.A.

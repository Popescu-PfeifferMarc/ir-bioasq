Although that study indicated the existence of domains, phase separations in the micrometer scale have not been observed by fluorescence microscopy in BSM/Chol/POPC mixtures, though they have for some other sphingomyelins (SM). Here we examine the same BSM/Chol/POPC system by a combination of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and Monte Carlo simulations. The results clearly demonstrate that domains are formed in this system. Comparison of the FRET experimental data with the computer simulations allows the estimate of lipid-lipid interaction Gibbs energies between SM/Chol, SM/POPC, and Chol/POPC. The latter two interactions are weakly repulsive, but the interaction between SM and Chol is favorable. Furthermore, those three unlike lipid interaction parameters between the three possible lipid pairs are sufficient for the existence of a closed loop in the ternary phase diagram, without the need to involve multibody interactions. The calculations also indicate that the largest POPC domains contain several thousand lipids, corresponding to linear sizes of the order of a few hundred nanometers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The formation of domains in ternary mixtures of sphingomyelin (SM), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), and cholesterol (Chol) has received considerable attention. Phase diagrams of membranes containing these three components have been investigated experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) and theoretically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) because those lipids are the major components of the outer monolayer of mammalian membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) and are believed to be essential components of membrane rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><p>Using the terminology of liquid-liquid phase separation first introduced by Ipsen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), POPC forms a liquid-disordered (<italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>) phase, whereas SM/Chol mixtures with a molar ratio close to 1:1 form a liquid-ordered (<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub>) phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). The existence of phases or domains in ternary mixtures and the location of their boundaries in the phase diagram have been somewhat controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), but there is fairly good agreement on the broad location of a region of <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> coexistence at room temperature, as depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. The exact location, shape, and boundaries of this <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> coexistence region appear to vary with the method of observation and the precise type of SM and phosphatidylcholine (PC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Nevertheless, some form of <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> coexistence appears to be a general feature of mixtures containing equimolar amounts of SM and Chol, with variable amounts of PC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>dashed line</italic>). It seems that a significant part of the discrepancies lies in the spatial resolution of the various methods used. In particular, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) prepared from mixtures containing brain sphingomyelin (BSM) appear uniform by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) but seem to consist of different lipid domains when examined by other methods. We could not explain the kinetics of interaction of the peptide <italic>&#x003b4;</italic>-lysin with vesicles of BSM/Chol/POPC in any other way than through <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> domain coexistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). For domains to be visible by fluorescence microscopy, their size must be larger than the wavelength of the light used, in practice typically of the order of 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has indicated the existence of domains in mixtures where they are not detected by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Simplified phase diagram for a ternary mixture of BSM/Chol/POPC at &#x0223c;25&#x000b0;C, based on kinetics of peptide/membrane interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). The approximate location of the <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> coexistence region is shown in gray. Detailed diagrams have been published for a few mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Most of these diagrams show a central two-phase, <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> coexistence region, which in some systems appears more complicated because of the presence of adjacent regions containing solid phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="biophysj00100107F01_HT"></graphic></fig><p>Another point much debated in the field is whether phospholipid/Chol interactions are best described as <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> domain (or phase) coexistence or as condensed complexes of phospholipid and Chol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Here, Monte Carlo simulations of a simple lattice model of the membrane are used to help in understanding the microscopic behavior of these mixtures. If one focuses on the <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> coexistence region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), SM and POPC are both in a liquid state. Therefore, no phase transitions are involved, and each lipid can be represented by a single state. POPC is envisioned to be in the <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub> state and SM in the <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> state. The Gibbs energy of the lattice is determined solely by differences in the mutual interactions of lipid neighbors. The unlike nearest-neighbor interaction Gibbs energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), or interaction parameter for short, is defined for each pair of lipids (A, B &#x0003d; SM, POPC, or Chol, A &#x02260; B) by<disp-formula id="fd1"><label>(1)</label><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[10pt]{article}

\begin{equation*}{\omega}_{{\mathrm{AB}}}=g_{{\mathrm{AB}}}-\frac{1}{2}(g_{{\mathrm{AA}}}+g_{{\mathrm{BB}}}),\end{equation*}\end{document}</tex-math></disp-formula>where <italic>g</italic><sub>AA</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>BB</sub> are the Gibbs energies of interaction between two A or two B molecules, and <italic>g</italic><sub>AB</sub> is the Gibbs energy of interaction between one A and one B molecule. It is the parameter <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> that determines whether lipids A and B mix well or separate into domains. Therefore, the most important decision in this type of Monte Carlo simulation is the choice of unlike nearest-neighbor interaction parameters. In this system, there are three: <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>SP</sub> for SM/POPC, <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>SC</sub> for SM/Chol, and <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>CP</sub> for Chol/POPC interactions. These parameters can be estimated from experimental lipid distributions obtained using the nearest-neighbor recognition method of Regen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Briefly, a binary mixture containing lipid analogs with a thiol group is allowed to reach its equilibrium distribution under conditions where thiolate/disulfide exchange occurs. The mixture is then quenched by changing to acidic conditions, fixing the disulfide bonds between analog lipid pairs. Several types of lipid dimers are thus formed: A-B heterodimers and two types of homodimers, A-A and B-B. The distribution of heterodimers and homodimers is then analyzed and the equilibrium constant for partner exchange is calculated. These types of data have been obtained for several lipid pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). From those data, <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> for different pairs of lipids can be calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Another approach is to obtain an experimental measure of domain formation, from FRET or excimer/monomer ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), and compare it with Monte Carlo simulations, varying <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> in the simulations until a match is obtained. Similarly, the experimental data can be obtained from the heat capacity functions of pure and mixed bilayers, which are compared with those calculated from Monte Carlo simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). In has been found that for most lipid pairs <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> &#x0003d; &#x000b1;100&#x02013;300 cal/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), which is at most half the thermal energy at room temperature, <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>, where <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> is Boltzmann's constant. For reference, close to room temperature, a value of <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> &#x0003d; &#x0002b;400 cal/mol in a two-component system leads to complete phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Most unlike lipid-lipid interactions are found to be repulsive (<italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> &#x0003e; 0), meaning that lipids prefer to interact with like neighbors, but some are attractive (<italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> &#x0003c; 0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). The interaction between saturated PC and Chol is especially important. Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) studied the temperature dependence of the unlike nearest-neighbor interaction Gibbs energy between dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and Chol in the <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> phase, where the Chol content is high. This temperature dependence of <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> for DPPC/Chol corresponds to an interaction enthalpy of &#x02212;2 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). From those data, <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> &#x0003d; &#x02212;320 cal/mol is estimated at 20&#x000b0;C, in the <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> phase. For distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and Chol, using a similar temperature dependence of the interaction parameter as for DPPC/Chol in combination with high temperature measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), the interaction between DSPC and Chol is estimated to be <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> &#x0003d; &#x02212;350 cal/mol.</p><p>It is well established that in the <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> state the interaction between SM and Chol is at least as favorable as between long-chain saturated PC and Chol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Therefore, it appears reasonable that the interaction parameter between SM and Chol be close to the largest value for PC/Chol in the <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> phase, that is, <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>SC</sub> &#x0003d; &#x02212;350 cal/mol. The interaction between Chol and saturated PC in the <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub> state is close to ideal (<italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> &#x02248; 0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). However, Chol interacts less favorably with unsaturated PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>), to the point of showing a strong &#x02018;aversion&#x02019; to polyunsaturated PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). The interaction of Chol with POPC must therefore lie between these two situations. It is not clear whether <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>-<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> phase separation between Chol and POPC exists at all. Some reports favor its existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>), but others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Most likely, if it exists, it is not extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Also, increasing <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> to 330 cal/mol between gel and fluid DPPC lipids leads to a first-order phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>), setting an upper bound for the value of <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>CP</sub>. Therefore, a value of <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>CP</sub> in the range 100&#x02013;200 cal/mol appears appropriate. The results reported here were obtained with <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>CP</sub> &#x0003d; 200 cal/mol for the POPC/Chol interaction. Finally, for the interaction between POPC and SM a small value would be appropriate if the system were entirely in the <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub> state. But for mixtures in the <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> coexistence region of the phase diagram, there is always a high content of Chol, so that most of the SM is probably in the <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> state. SM and POPC exhibit a large region of gel/<italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub> phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). A value of <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>SP</sub> &#x0003d; 300 cal/mol appears reasonable, as it is intermediate between the onset of large-scale phase separation (&#x02265;330 cal/mol) and almost ideal mixing (&#x0003c;200 cal/mol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). The physical origins of these lipid-lipid interactions were discussed in a recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).</p><p>In this article, FRET between a novel donor/acceptor pair of fluorescent lipids is used to investigate the existence of domains in BSM/Chol/POPC mixtures. This is combined with Monte Carlo simulations of the lipid bilayer on a lattice to obtain a measure of the lipid-lipid interactions between these three components. The simulations indicate the presence of domains on the order of a few hundred nanometers in addition to many smaller ones. These sizes would be below the resolution of fluorescence microscopy. Further, the Monte Carlo simulations are in good agreement with the FRET experimental data if a favorable interaction parameter of &#x02212;350 cal/mol between SM and Chol is used. This is a strong interaction for a lipid pair and would be consistent with formation of SM/Chol condensed complexes. On the other hand, the simulations also reveal the formation of large domains of mainly POPC and others of mainly SM/Chol, which can be identified with the <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> phases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) in chloroform solution; SM ((2S,3R,4E)-2-acylaminooctadec-4-ene-3-hydroxy-1-phosphocholine) from porcine brain (BSM), in chloroform solution; and Chol, as powder, were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

The lipid bilayer was represented by two superimposed triangular lattices with skew-periodic boundary conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). Lattices of 100 &#x000d7; 100 sites were used in most simulations. To verify that the conclusions apply to the experimental system employed (LUV, with &#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> lipids) a few simulations were performed on a 300 &#x000d7; 300 lattice (9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> sites). Each lattice represents one of the leaflets of the bilayer and each site represents a lipid molecule, SM, POPC, or Chol. Phospholipids are considered to be in a liquid state for the compositions simulated, according to the phase diagram (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Therefore, no phase transitions are involved. POPC is envisioned to be in the <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub> state and SM in the <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> state, but this conceptual framework has no influence on the simulations. The energy of the lattice is determined solely by differences in the mutual interactions of lipid neighbors. These interactions are represented by unlike nearest-neighbor interaction Gibbs energies, or interaction parameters for short, <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub>, defined for each pair of lipids (A, B &#x0003d; SM, POPC, or Chol, A &#x02260; B) by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd1">Eq. 1</xref>. The equilibration of the lattice is achieved by site exchange using a variation on the method of Kawasaki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). Rather than exchanging only nearest neighbors, the two sites for which a switch is attempted are both picked randomly from anywhere in the lattice. This ensures a much faster equilibration of the system and has no effect on the equilibrium properties calculated. This method could not be used for realistic kinetics because diffusion in a real system occurs by exchange of lipid nearest neighbors. However, the interest here is only in equilibrium properties, and allowing for exchange of nonnearest neighbors is a much more efficient equilibration method. The reason is, if only exchange of nearest neighbors is attempted, after small domains form a large fraction of the attempted moves leads to no change because there is a high probability that two neighbors are identical. This results in a waste of calculation time. In any case, simulations that used only nearest-neighbor exchange were also performed and the results were identical to those that used nonnearest neighbor exchanges&#x02014;but the time to reach equilibrium was &#x0223c;10&#x000d7; longer.</p><p>The algorithm is as follows. A Monte Carlo cycle (mcc) is defined as a number of attempted moves equal to the lattice size (10<sup>4</sup> for a 100 &#x000d7; 100 lattice). For each attempted move, a site on the lattice is picked at random. Here and in all other cases, the random number generator <italic>ran2</italic> of Press et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>) was used. The site to exchange with the first picked site is also chosen at random. The Gibbs energies before and after the exchange are calculated and the exchange probability is defined by <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; exp(&#x02212;&#x00394;<italic>G</italic>/<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>), where <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub> is Boltzmann's constant and <italic>T</italic> is temperature, which was set to 300 K in all simulations. The acceptance of the move is based on the algorithm of Metropolis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>): if <italic>p</italic> &#x02265; 1 the move is accepted; if <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 1, a random number (<italic>Ran</italic>&#x00023;) is generated, and the move is accepted if <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>Ran</italic>&#x00023;. The simulations were run for 10<sup>5</sup> mcc, which ensured that equilibrium was reached, as confirmed by occasional longer runs. The most important average properties computed were the POPC domain size and the fluorescence energy transfer efficiency (<italic>E</italic><sub>t</sub>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the partition coefficient (<italic>K</italic><sub>p</sub>) of NBD-POPE between SM/Chol and POPC bilayers has never been determined. For NBD-dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), <italic>K</italic><sub>p</sub> &#x0003d; 5.9 in favor of POPC over SM/Chol 6:4, and <italic>K</italic><sub>p</sub> &#x0003d; 4.2 in favor of POPC/Chol 1:1 over SM/Chol 6:4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>). Based on its much lower <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>, NBD-POPE is expected to partition even more favorably into POPC over SM/Chol mixtures. However, rather than assuming a value for <italic>K</italic><sub>p</sub> in the simulations, we simply assume that the fluorescent lipid probes, MB-POPE and NBD-POPE, behave as tagged POPC molecules in their interactions with other lipids. The only difference is that they can transfer energy if an acceptor (NBD-POPE) is within the distance <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> of a donor (MB-POPE). This assumption appears entirely justified because the acyl chains of both probes are exactly the same as those of POPC. Furthermore, experimentally there was no difference in FRET in bilayers of POPC or POPS, which have the same acyl chains. Therefore, the headgroup difference appears to have little influence in this respect.</p><p>Since a lipid has a diameter of &#x0223c;8 &#x000c5;, the experimentally determined <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x0003d; 46 &#x000c5; corresponds to a circle with a radius of &#x0223c;6 lipids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

Thus, a donor is considered to transfer energy if at least one acceptor is found within a distance of 6 lipids on the lattice in the same leaflet of the bilayer. Energy transfer across the bilayer occurs over a projected distance of &#x0223c;2 lipids in the opposite leaflet. This follows from the assumption that the fluorophore moieties of the probes occupy a location approximately equal to that occupied by the choline groups and knowing that the distance between the choline headgroups in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine is &#x0223c;42 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>).

This distribution is highly asymmetric: many small domains coexist with one or two very large ones. Essentially a phase separation occurs between a SM/Chol 1:1 domain and a POPC domain.

FRET occurs between two probes, MB-POPE and NBD-POPE, the acyl chains of which are identical to those of POPC and POPS. Therefore, these probes are expected to behave much more similarly to POPC than to SM or Chol. FRET was examined in BSM/Chol/POPC mixtures with a ratio of BSM/Chol 1:1 and variable POPC content. Samples of pure POPC and pure POPS containing the probes were also examined and showed identical behavior, indicating that electrostatic effects or other headgroup interactions have a negligible influence on the observed FRET. If these effects were significant, repulsion between the two anionic probes would be expected to be larger in POPC (zwitterionic) than in POPS (anionic), which should mask the probes. In that case, a lower FRET should be observed in POPC compared to POPS. However, FRET is identical in both lipid matrices (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>When the POPC content is increased in mixtures of BSM/Chol/POPC with equimolar amounts of BSM and Chol while increasing the probe concentration in the same proportion, FRET increases, tending to a plateau (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). When the POPC content is increased, but keeping the probe concentration fixed with respect to the total lipid, the energy transfer efficiency (<italic>E</italic><sub>t</sub>) goes through a maximum at <italic>X</italic><sub>POPC</sub> &#x0223c;0.30 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This clearly indicates that domains exist in these mixtures; otherwise, if mixing were ideal, a constant value of <italic>E</italic><sub>t</sub> would be observed. Qualitatively, we interpret the occurrence of this maximum as the result of two different processes. At low <italic>X</italic><sub>POPC</sub> (&#x02264;0.20), POPC exists mainly in small domains; POPC molecules and the probes are therefore dispersed in the SM/Chol matrix, with relatively few donor/acceptor pairs in the same domains. As <italic>X</italic><sub>POPC</sub> increases, larger domains exist and more probe pairs reside in the same domains, so FRET increases. However, as <italic>X</italic><sub>POPC</sub> increases even further, because in this experiment the probe concentration is fixed relative to the total lipid, the probes are diluted out within the POPC domains and FRET decreases.</p><p>To obtain a quantitative interpretation of those results, Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two superimposed triangular lattices, which represent the lipid bilayer. The two lattices were necessary to account for energy transfer across the bilayer, which occurs because of the large F&#x000f6;rster distance of this donor/acceptor pair, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x0003d; 46 &#x000c5;. Using this experimental parameter and the thickness of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>), and no adjustable parameters, the Monte Carlo simulations reproduced well the FRET observed in pure POPC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In simulations of SM/Chol/POPC mixtures, the unlike lipid-lipid interaction Gibbs energies need to be included. The approximate values of those interaction parameters were based on experimental data as much as possible and then fine-tuned by comparing the experimentally observed FRET with its value calculated in Monte Carlo simulations. The values that yielded the overall best agreement between data and simulations were <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>SC</sub> &#x0003d; &#x02212;350 cal/mol for SM/Chol, <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>SP</sub> &#x0003d; &#x0002b;300 cal/mol for SM/POPC, and <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>CP</sub> &#x0003d; &#x0002b;200 cal/mol for Chol/POPC interaction. These parameters indicate that there is a slight repulsive interaction between Chol and POPC, but so little that it would be hard to distinguish from random mixing (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 <italic>C</italic></xref>); a stronger repulsive interaction between SM and POPC (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 <italic>B</italic></xref>); and a favorable interaction between SM and Chol (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 <italic>D</italic></xref>). This might be sufficient to explain observations that have been interpreted as the formation of condensed complexes between phospholipids and Chol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). It is, however, also consistent with the existence of <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> phase or domains. The snapshot of a Monte Carlo simulation of SM/Chol/POPC 35:35:30, shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 <italic>A</italic></xref>, makes these comments evident. On the one hand, Chol molecules (<italic>red</italic>) appear usually paired with SM molecules (<italic>white</italic>), giving the impression of a complex. On the other hand, extensive regions of SM/Chol (<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub>) coexist with large POPC domains (<italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub>).</p><p>For <italic>X</italic><sub>POPC</sub> &#x0003d; 0.30, the POPC domain distribution consists of one large domain (occasionally two), which contains &#x0223c;3/4 of the POPC lipids, and many small ones with &#x0223c;10 lipids or fewer (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>) in both 100 &#x000d7; 100 and 300 &#x000d7; 300 lattices. The largest POPC domains would have real linear dimensions of the order of a few hundred nanometers. These sizes are too small to be observed by fluorescence microscopy and indeed they have not been observed by this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). However, they are large enough to be detected by FRET. They are also large enough to have a significant effect on the interaction of peptides and peripheral proteins with membranes. Indeed, the kinetics of the interaction of the peptide <italic>&#x003b4;</italic>-lysin with vesicles of BSM/Chol/POPC are strongly dependent on the fractions of <italic>L</italic><sub>d</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). On that basis, we have proposed a phase diagram for BSM/Chol/POPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). We conjectured then that the domains must be at least larger than the peptide length (4 nm) to be detected. The conclusions reached here are consistent with that idea.</p><p>Nevertheless, if the scaling of domain size with lattice size were exact, &#x0223c;3/4 of the lipid in a GUV with a composition BSM/Chol/POPC &#x0223c;1:1:1 would form a domain that would be visible by fluorescence microscopy. Simulating a lattice with a size corresponding to a GUV is beyond our present capacity. However, a comparison of the effect of the unlike lipid-lipid interaction parameters on the domain distribution functions in 100 &#x000d7; 100 and 300 &#x000d7; 300 lattices indicates that scaling with lattice size is approximate but not exact. This is because the entropy gain from splitting a large domain into smaller ones is greater in the larger lattice. Thus, as the lattice size increases, the domain size increases as well, but not in the same proportion. Furthermore, slightly smaller parameters in the 300 &#x000d7; 300 lattice are sufficient to produce the same effect on the calculated FRET in comparison with the 100 &#x000d7; 100 lattice. This suggests that the real parameters might be slightly smaller in absolute value. In a GUV, the distribution would be even further shifted to smaller domains. To produce good agreement with experiment, the absolute values of the unlike lipid-lipid interaction Gibbs energies, <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>SP</sub>, <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>CP</sub>, and <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>SC</sub>, must add up to 850 cal/mol. Very small decreases in the absolute value of any of these three parameters, by as little as 50 cal/mol, lead to a change from phase separation to small domains (compare <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figs. 9 <italic>A</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). It is also possible that the unlike lipid-lipid interaction Gibbs energies are actually somewhat smaller in a GUV than in a LUV. This would further enhance the tendency for small domains in GUVs of this BSM/Chol/POPC mixture, in agreement with the fluorescence microscopy results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), and is perhaps one of the reasons there is some discrepancy in observations of large phase separation or not when these mixtures are investigated in different vesicle systems.</p><p>Finally, the simulations presented here shed some light on the observation that whereas binary mixtures of SM/Chol, SM/POPC, and Chol/POPC do not show macroscopic phase separation by fluorescence microscopy of GUVs, some of these ternary mixtures do, leading to a closed loop in the ternary phase diagram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>), as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Examination of <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> clearly shows that a closed loop occurs in the phase diagram. In <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 <italic>A</italic></xref>, phase separation is observed in the ternary mixture SM/Chol/POPC 35:35:30. But in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 <italic>B</italic></xref> (SM/POPC 70:30), <italic>C</italic> (Chol/POPC 70:30), and <italic>D</italic> (SM/Chol 1:1), where the pairs of components have been combined in binary mixtures containing the same amount of POPC as in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 <italic>A</italic></xref> or equimolar amounts of SM and Chol, no massive phase separation is observed. Thus, all that is required for the observation of a closed loop in the ternary phase diagram is a strong, favorable interaction between SM and Chol and two weak, unfavorable interactions between Chol and POPC and between SM and POPC. When SM and Chol are paired they maintain the same interactions with each other and with POPC as they have in the absence of pair formation. That is, when adjacent to Chol, SM does not have a different interaction with POPC than what it has in the absence of Chol. Thus, there is no need to involve multibody interactions to explain these properties of ternary mixtures of SM/Chol/POPC; three pairs of binary interactions (<italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub>) are sufficient.</p><p>McConnell and his collaborators have proposed a model that explains those experimental observations by the formation of SM-Chol condensed complexes, which have a repulsive interaction with POPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>). In this model, SM/Chol binary mixtures would not show phase separation. These ideas are compatible with the results of the Monte Carlo simulations presented here, with the parameter values used, and within the approximation of our simple model, which has only one state for SM (<italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub>). The condensed complex model uses regular solution theory and selects as key chemical components the complex and the disordered lipid (POPC). The interactions between these components&#x02014;the equilibrium constant for complex formation and the repulsion between complex and POPC&#x02014;then, together with the mixing entropy, determine the properties of the system. Perhaps the main difference between the two models is the magnitude of the (Gibbs) energies of the interactions involved. The repulsion between a SM-Chol condensed complex and POPC is similar to the average repulsion between a SM-Chol pair and POPC in our model. But the interaction between SM and Chol is only &#x02212;350 cal/mol in our model, whereas the equilibrium constant for formation of a condensed complex corresponds to a Gibbs energy of &#x02212;3 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>) at room temperature. The enthalpy of formation of a condensed complex is about &#x02212;9 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>), whereas the experimentally determined temperature dependence of <italic>&#x003c9;</italic><sub>AB</sub> for DPPC/Chol in the <italic>L</italic><sub>o</sub> phase is only &#x02212;2 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). The high values of the energies in the condensed complex model are probably, in part, a consequence of using regular solution theory, which overestimates the mixing entropy and may therefore require large energy values to compensate for it.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Alexis Oldham for performing a few of the experiments.</p><p>This work was supported in part by Cottrell College Science Award CC6246 from the Research Corporation and by Grant GM072507 from the National Institutes of Health.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal">Pokorny, A., L.

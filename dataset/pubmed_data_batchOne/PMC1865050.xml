The interaction is specific for ER&#x003b1; as ER&#x003b2; and several other nuclear receptors tested did not interact with RAP80. Interaction between RAP80 and ER&#x003b1; was supported by mammalian two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. The hinge/ligand-binding domain of ER&#x003b1; is sufficient for interaction with RAP80. RAP80 overexpression reduces ER&#x003b1; polyubiquitination, increases the level of ER&#x003b1; protein, and enhances ER&#x003b1;-mediated transactivation. Knockdown of endogenous RAP80 expression by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced ER&#x003b1; protein level and the E2-dependent induction of pS2. In this study, we also demonstrate that RAP80 contains two functional ubiquitin-interaction motifs (UIMs) that are able to bind ubiquitin and to direct monoubiquitination of RAP80. Deletion of these UIMs does not affect the ability of RAP80 to interact with ER&#x003b1;, but eliminates the effects of RAP80 on ER&#x003b1; polyubiquitination, the level of ER&#x003b1; protein, and ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcription. These data indicate that the UIMs in RAP80 are critical for the function of RAP80. Our study identifies ER&#x003b1; as a new RAP80-interacting protein and suggests that RAP80 may be an important modulator of ER&#x003b1; activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Estrogens are important for a number of physiological processes that include various reproductive functions and bone metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). The biological actions of estrogens are primarily mediated by two high-affinity nuclear receptors, estrogen receptor &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; (ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In the classical model of nuclear receptor action, ER binding of estrogen releases the receptor from inactive complexes containing heat-shock proteins and immunophilins, followed by dimerization, and binding of ER homodimers to estrogen-response elements (EREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes. Agonist binding induces a conformational change including a repositioning of helix 12 which represents the ligand-inducible activation function AF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">3&#x02013;7</xref>). This allows recruitment of co-activator complexes that cause decompactation of chromatin through their histone acetylase activity and transcriptional activation of target genes. In addition to co-activators, a large number of other proteins that interact with ER&#x003b1; and modify its transcriptional activity have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">8&#x02013;12</xref>). Moreover, various posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, sumoylation and ubiquitination, have been reported to modulate ER&#x003b1; activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16">13&#x02013;16</xref>). Polyubiquitination and degradation of ER&#x003b1; and other nuclear receptors by the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome system is important for regulating nuclear receptor levels and their transcriptional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">16&#x02013;21</xref>). Several components of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system, such as PSMC5 (SUG/TRIP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), RSP5/RPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), UBCH7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), have been reported to interact with a number of nuclear receptors, including ER&#x003b1;. Recently, sumoylation has been identified as another mechanism that regulates the transcriptional activity of ER&#x003b1; and was shown to involve UBC9, PIAS1 and PIAS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). However, our knowledge about the mechanisms by which ubiquitination and sumoylation regulate nuclear receptor level and activity is still far from complete.</p><p>We recently described the identification of a novel protein, referred to as receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) or ubiquitin interaction motif containing 1 (UIMC1) as approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). RAP80 is an acidic nuclear protein of 719 amino acids that contains two Cys-X<sub>2</sub>-Cys-X<sub>11</sub>-His-X<sub>3</sub>-Cys zinc finger-like motifs near the carboxyl terminus. RAP80 is expressed in many tissues, most abundantly in testis. RAP80 was shown to interact with the retinoid-related testis-associated receptor (RTR), also known as germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) or NR6A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29">26&#x02013;29</xref>). The objective of the current study was to determine the potential role of RAP80 in modulating the activity of other nuclear receptors. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that RAP80 interacted with ER&#x003b1;, but not with ER&#x003b2; or several other nuclear receptors. This interaction required the presence of an agonist, such as estrogen, while antagonists did not induce the interaction. RAP80 was found to contain two putative ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM<sup>RAP80</sup>) at its amino terminus. UIMs consist of a short-sequence motif of about 20 residues reported to direct (multi)monoubiquitination of proteins that contain this motif. In addition, UIMs have been shown to bind ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32 B33">30&#x02013;33</xref>). UIMs were first identified in the S5a subunit of the 19S proteasome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). UIMs have subsequently been found in a variety of proteins with roles in endocytosis, DNA repair, (de)ubiquitination, replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In this study, we show that the UIMs in RAP80 promote monoubiquitination and are able to bind ubiquitin and, therefore, are functional UIM sequences. Moreover, we demonstrate that RAP80 reduces the polyubiquitination of ER&#x003b1; and increases the level of ER&#x003b1; protein and ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcription. The UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is essential for these effects of RAP80 on ER&#x003b1;. Our study identifies RAP80 as a UIM-containing and ER&#x003b1;-interacting protein and provides evidence for a role of RAP80 as a modulator of ER&#x003b1;-dependent transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The yeast and mammalian two-hybrid vectors pGBKT7, pGBT9, pGADT7, pM, pVP16, and the retroviral vector pLXIN were purchased from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA).

To determine whether RAP80 was able to interact with other nuclear receptors, we performed yeast two-hybrid analysis using RAP80 as prey and several full-length nuclear receptors or their ligand-binding domains as bait.

The potential interactions between RAP80 and nuclear receptors were analyzed in the presence or absence of corresponding ligand.

The following agonists were used: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (100&#x02009;nM) for VDR; dihydrotestosterone (100&#x02009;nM) for AR; T0901317 (1&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) for LXR&#x003b1;; GW845 (100&#x02009;nM) for PPAR&#x003b3;; 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (100&#x02009;nM) for ER&#x003b1;(FL) and ER&#x003b1;(LBD); the RXR-panagonist SR11217 (1&#x02009;&#x000b5;M); retinoic acid (1&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) for RAR&#x003b3;. <bold>(B)</bold> Interaction of ER&#x003b1;(FL) and ER&#x003b2;(FL) with RAP80 as a function of the estradiol concentration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl1112f1"/></fig></p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, the interaction of RAP80 with full-length ER&#x003b1; was dependent on the concentration of E2. A concentration as low as 0.2 nM E2 was able to induce the interaction between RAP80 and ER&#x003b1;. The EC<sub>50</sub> was calculated to be 1.9 nM E2. RAP80 did not interact with full-length ER&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) or ER&#x003b2;(LBD) (not shown) either in the presence or absence of E2.

CHO cells were co-transfected with (UAS)<sub>5</sub>-Luc reporter, pM&#x02013;RAP80 and increasing amounts of pVP16&#x02013;ER&#x003b1; plasmid DNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, expression of GAL4(DBD)&#x02013;RAP80 alone did not enhance transcriptional activation of the (UAS)<sub>5</sub>-Luc reporter. Co-expression of GAL4(DBD)&#x02013;RAP80 with pVP16&#x02013;ER&#x003b1; only slightly increased reporter activity, while addition of E2 greatly induced this reporter activity. Co-transfection with the expression plasmid pcDNA3.1&#x02013;RAP80 totally abrogated this induction due to competition of RAP80 with GAL4(DBD)&#x02013;RAP80&#x00394;N129 for ER&#x003b1; binding. These observations support our conclusion that RAP80 interacts with ER&#x003b1; in an E2-dependent manner.

The results demonstrated that carboxyl-terminal deletions up to aa 504 had little effect on the ability of RAP80 to bind ER&#x003b1;, while RAP80&#x00394;C404 was still able to co-immunoprecipitate ER&#x003b1; but less efficiently. In contrast, RAP80&#x00394;C304 and likewise the more severe deletion mutants RAP80&#x00394;C204 and RAP80&#x00394;C122 were unable to interact with ER&#x003b1;. These observations indicate that the region of RAP80 between aa 304 and 404 is critical for the interaction with ER&#x003b1; and that the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger-like motifs are not required. Although several amino-terminal deletions of RAP80 were constructed, none of amino-truncated proteins were expressed in cells. This might be due to improper folding of these mutants and their rapid degradation by the proteasome system.

These UIMs (UIM<sup>RAP80</sup>) exhibit high homology with the consensus UIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A).

(<bold>C</bold>) HEK293 cells were transfected with wild type or mutant pLXIN&#x02013;3&#x000d7;FLAG&#x02013;RAP80&#x00394;C122 and pCMV&#x02013;HA&#x02013;Ub as indicated. Cells were treated and processed as described under A.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl1112f8"/></fig></p><p>The UIMs in RAP80 contain two lysine residues (K<sup>90</sup> and K<sup>112</sup>) that are potential ubiquitination sites. To determine whether these sites are important for the multi-ubiquitination of RAP80, the effect of point mutations in these residues on RAP80 multi-ubiquitination was examined. None of the lysine mutants, K<sup>90</sup>R, K<sup>112</sup>R, or the double mutant K<sup>90,112</sup>R, affected the degree of ubiquitination of RAP80 suggesting that K<sup>90</sup> and K<sup>112</sup> are not substrates of monoubiquitination (Figure S3). Further evidence for the role of UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> in the monoubiquitination of RAP80 came from experiments analyzing the ubiquitination of the amino terminus of RAP80. RAP80&#x00394;C122, containing the amino terminus including UIM<sup>RAP80</sup>, was ubiquitinated whereas RAP80&#x00394;C78, lacking the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup>, was not suggesting that the UIM is required for RAP80 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). In the absence of exogenous HA&#x02013;ubiquitin, the anti-FLAG antibody recognized several bands likely representing multi-ubiquitinated RAP80&#x00394;C122 conjugated with endogenous ubiquitin. No such bands were observed with RAP80&#x00394;C78.</p><p>A88 and A113 are highly conserved among UIMs of different proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), and have been reported to be important for UIM function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). We, therefore, examined the effect of the A88S, A113S and the A88,113S double mutation on the ubiquitination of RAP80&#x00394;C122. Our data showed that the single mutations diminished RAP80 multiubiquitination, while the double mutant A88,113S caused a more pronounced decrease in ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). The results are in agreement with the conclusion that UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is required for the multi-monoubiquitination of the amino terminus of RAP80.</p></sec><sec><title>The UIMs of RAP80 are critical for its effects on ER&#x003b1;</title><p>Next, we investigated the importance of the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> on the interaction of RAP80 with ER&#x003b1;. First, we examined whether deletion of UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> had any effect on the subcellular localization of RAP80. Full-length FLAG&#x02013;RAP80 or FLAG&#x02013;RAP80&#x00394;UIM1,2 was transiently expressed in HeLa cells and their subcellular localization examined by confocal microscopy. Figure S4 shows that both FLAG&#x02013;RAP80 and RAP80&#x00394;UIM1,2 were localized to the nucleus.</p><p>To determine whether the UIMs play a role in the interaction between RAP80 and ER&#x003b1;, HeLa cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1&#x02013;ER&#x003b1;&#x02013;Myc-His and pLXIN&#x02013;3&#x000d7;FLAG&#x02013;RAP80 expression plasmids encoding either full-length RAP80 or several UIM deletion mutants of RAP80. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that deletion of a single UIM or both UIMs did not abrogate the interaction between RAP80 and ER&#x003b1; (Figure S5).</p><p>To determine whether UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> was required for the observed increase in the level of ER&#x003b1; protein by RAP80, the effects of RAP80 and RAP80UIM1,2 on the level of ER&#x003b1; protein were compared. HeLa cells expressing pER&#x003b1; only contained low levels of ER&#x003b1; protein. RAP80 significantly enhanced ER&#x003b1; levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A), whereas RAP80UIM1,2 only slightly increased the level of ER&#x003b1; protein. Expression of HA&#x02013;Ub caused a further increase in the level of ER&#x003b1; protein. These data suggest that the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is required for the increase in ER&#x003b1; protein level induced by RAP80.

Since UIMs have been implicated in ubiquitin binding and in the modulation of ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), this raised the question of whether RAP80 affected ER&#x003b1; ubiquitination. To examine this, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1&#x02013;ER&#x003b1;&#x02013;Myc-His, pCMV&#x02013;HA&#x02013;ubiquitin and pLXIN&#x02013;3&#x000d7;FLAG&#x02013;RAP80 or pLXIN&#x02013;3&#x000d7;FLAG&#x02013;RAP80&#x00394;UIM1,2. Cells were treated with MG132 for 4&#x02009;h before protein extracts were prepared and protein complexes immunoprecipitated with an anti-ER&#x003b1; antibody. The protein complexes were subsequently examined by western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody to detect ER&#x003b1; ubiquitination. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), the presence of E2 enhanced polyubiquitination of ER&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). Expression of RAP80 strongly inhibited ER&#x003b1; polyubiquitination whereas RAP80&#x00394;UIM1,2 had little effect. These results suggest that the observed increase in the level of ER&#x003b1; protein induced by RAP80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) may involve reduced polyubiquitination and degradation of ER&#x003b1;. Reduced ER&#x003b1; protein levels were not observed in the experiment described in Figure 10C and may be due to the high expression of ER&#x003b1; induced by pcDNA3.1&#x02013;ER&#x003b1;&#x02013;Myc-His. RAP80 did not affect ER&#x003b1; ubiquitination in the absence of E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B) or in the presence of tamoxifen (data not shown). The latter is in agreement with the demonstration that interaction of RAP80 with ER&#x003b1; is dependent on the presence of an agonist.</p><p>We next examined whether UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> was required for the modulation of ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional activation by RAP80.

These results indicate that UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is critical for the modulation of ER&#x003b1; activity by RAP80.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we identify ER&#x003b1; as a new RAP80-interacting protein. The interaction of RAP80 with nuclear receptors is very selective since a number of receptors, including ER&#x003b2;, PPAR&#x003b3;, ROR&#x003b3; and ERR&#x003b1; were unable to interact with RAP80 either in the presence or absence of their corresponding ligand. The interaction of RAP80 with ER&#x003b1; is dependent on the presence of an ER&#x003b1; agonist, as E2 and E3, promoted this interaction whereas the antagonists ICI 182,780 and tamoxifen did not. Previous studies have shown that binding of an agonist to the ligand-binding pocket of ER&#x003b1; induces a conformational change in the receptor. This involves a repositioning of helix 12 that allows recruitment of co-activators that subsequently mediate the transcriptional activation of ER&#x003b1; target genes by ER&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Binding of an antagonist induces a conformational change that results in the recruitment of co-repressors rather than co-activators. The dependency of the interaction of RAP80 with ER&#x003b1; on agonist binding indicates that RAP80 interacts with the transcriptionally active conformation of ER&#x003b1;.</p><p>The interaction between RAP80 and ER&#x003b1; was confirmed by mammalian two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation. <italic>In vitro</italic> pull-down analysis with GST&#x02013;RAP80 protein demonstrated that RAP80 interacted with full-length ER&#x003b1;, ER&#x003b1;&#x00394;N180 (containing the DBD, hinge domain and LBD), and with ER&#x003b1;&#x00394;N248 (containing the hinge and LBD), but did not interact with ER&#x003b1;&#x00394;C248 (containing the amino terminus, including the DBD). These observations suggest that RAP80 and ER&#x003b1; physically interact with each other and indicate that the amino terminus and DBD of ER&#x003b1; are not an absolute necessity for this interaction. The requirement of the LBD of ER&#x003b1; is in agreement with our observation that the interaction is ligand dependent. Thus, ligand-induced changes could unmask binding motifs in ER&#x003b1; required for its interaction with RAP80.</p><p>To determine which domain in RAP80 is required for its interaction with ER&#x003b1;, the effect of various mutations in RAP80 on this interaction was examined. Analysis of a series of carboxyl-terminal deletions showed that the zinc finger motifs are not required for the interaction of RAP80 with ER&#x003b1;, but that the region between aa 304 and 404 is essential. A number of transcriptional mediators have been reported to interact with the LBD of agonist-bound ER&#x003b1; through a sequence containing an LXXLL consensus motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41 B42 B43">41&#x02013;43</xref>). RAP80 contains two related sequences <sup>296</sup>ILCQL and <sup>625</sup>LLSFL. However, deletion of <sup>625</sup>LLSFL or mutation of <sup>296</sup>ILCQL into <sup>296</sup>ISCQL did not affect the interaction of RAP80 with ER&#x003b1; (not shown) suggesting that the interaction of RAP80 with ER&#x003b1; involves a different sequence.</p><p>In addition to the two zinc finger motifs, we identified two putative UIMs at the amino terminus of RAP80 that exhibit high homology to the consensus UIM eeex&#x003a6;xxAxxxSxxexxxx (in which &#x003a6; is a hydrophobic residue, e is a negatively charged residue and x is any amino acid) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Several studies have shown that UIMs often mediate the monoubiquitination of proteins that contain these sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). In addition, UIMs have been reported to bind ubiquitin and as such mediate intra- or intermolecular interactions by interacting with ubiquitinated target proteins or proteins containing a ubiquitin-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Analysis of the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> demonstrated that RAP80 was able to bind polyubiquitin chains of different lengths and to varying degrees. In addition, UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> was able to promote the monoubiquitination of a chimeric EGFP&#x02013;UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> protein and the amino terminus of RAP80 while no ubiquitination was observed when the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> was deleted. In addition, point mutations in A88 and A113, alanines that are highly conserved among UIMs, greatly diminish ubiquitination of RAP80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C) in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Although the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> contains two lysines, mutations of these lysines had little effect on RAP80 ubiquitination suggesting that they are not substrates for monoubiquitination. This is in agreement with reports indicating that lysines within UIMs are generally not monoubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Based on the calculated size of ubiquitinated RAP80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A), it was concluded that several lysines may become monoubiquitinated. These observations support the conclusion that the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> domain in RAP80 is functional and able to guide monoubiquitination of RAP80 and, in addition, is able to bind ubiquitin. We propose that the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> domain mediates a signal that is critical to the function of RAP80.</p><p>Although the mechanisms of protein polyubiquitination and their role in targeting proteins to proteasomes for degradation has been intensively studied, the role of (multi)monoubiquitination is not as well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Monoubiquitination functions as a signal that affects the structure, activity or localization of the target protein, thereby regulating a broad range of cellular functions, including membrane protein trafficking, histone function, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair and replication. UIMs are required for the (multi)monoubiquitination of several proteins, such as epsin, Eps15, and Eps15R, involved in receptor endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). These proteins play a critical role in the recruitment of plasma membrane receptor proteins to clathrin-coated pits and their internalization. Deletion or mutation in these UIMs greatly impacts the internalization of membrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). A recent study provided evidence for an intramolecular interaction between monoubiquitin and the UIM in Eps15 and Hrs that prevents them to interact with ubiquitinated membrane receptors, thereby affecting their trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Since RAP80 is a nuclear protein, it is likely not involved in membrane receptor endocytosis. Monoubiquitination has been reported to be involved in the regulation of several nuclear functions. For example, monoubiquitination of histones does not target them for degradation but has a role in the regulation of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Monoubiquitination is also critical in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). For example, the subunit S5a (Rpn10) of the 19S proteosomal regulatory complex contains two UIMs that interact with the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of RAD23B (HR23B), a protein that targets several proteins to the proteasome, including the excision repair factor XPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>Monoubiquitination can also affect the localization of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). However, deletion of the UIMs in RAP80 does not affect its nuclear localization. In addition, our data show that the UIMs are not required for the interaction of RAP80 with ER&#x003b1;, but are critical to the effects of RAP80 on ER&#x003b1; function. Since several UIM-containing proteins have been reported to be involved in ubiquitination or ubiquitin metabolism, we examined whether RAP80 had any effect on the ubiquitination of ER&#x003b1;. Our results demonstrate that increased expression of RAP80 decreases the ubiquitination of ER&#x003b1;. Although the UIMs were not required for the interaction of RAP80 with ER&#x003b1;, deletion of UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> eliminates RAP80's capacity to inhibit ER&#x003b1; ubiquitination suggesting that the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is essential for the effect of RAP80 on ER&#x003b1; ubiquitination. What the functions of ubiquitination of nuclear receptors are, is still controversial and not yet completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Ubiquitination of ER&#x003b1; appears to have multiple functions and can affect ER&#x003b1; protein levels and turnover and ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional regulation at different steps in the ER&#x003b1; signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). One function of ER&#x003b1; polyubiquitination is related to targeting misfolded, unliganded ER&#x003b1; for degradation by the proteasome system. This involves binding of the Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) which, through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, ubiquitinates ER&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Another role of ER&#x003b1; ubiquitination relates to transcriptional regulation. Several studies have shown that in the presence of agonist, ER&#x003b1; is rapidly degraded by the proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This turnover of ER&#x003b1; appears to be important for efficient ER&#x003b1;-dependent transcriptional activation. Such a coupling between protein degradation and transactivation might be an integral part of nuclear receptor function. However, overexpression of proteasome 26S subunit PSMC5 (SUG1) enhances the ubiquitination of ER&#x003b1; in the presence of agonist and inhibited transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). In addition, Fan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) reported that inhibition of proteasome degradation by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 enhanced ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional activation. These studies suggest that there is a delicate balance between level of ER&#x003b1; protein and transcriptional activation.</p><p>Our results show that expression of RAP80 enhances ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional activation possibly by causing an increase in ER&#x003b1; protein levels. The latter may be related to the reduced ER&#x003b1; ubiquitination and degradation. We show that the effects of RAP80 on ER&#x003b1; were dependent on UIM<sup>RAP80</sup>, supporting our hypothesis that this domain is critical to the function of RAP80. The effects of RAP80 on ER&#x003b1; are very similar to those recently reported for MUC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). MUC1 was shown to stabilize ER&#x003b1; by inhibiting its ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The carboxyl-terminal subunit of MUC1 was shown to associate with ER&#x003b1; complexes on estrogen-responsive promoters and to stimulate ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcription. MUC1 mediates this action by directly binding to the DBD of ER&#x003b1; in an agonist-dependent manner. These different findings indicate the complex role of ubiquitination in the regulation of ER&#x003b1; function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).</p><p>In summary, in this study we identify ER&#x003b1; as a new RAP80-interacting protein and show that this interaction is dependent on ER&#x003b1; agonist binding. We demonstrate that RAP80 is a UIM-containing protein with two functional UIMs that are able to bind ubiquitin and direct monoubiquitination. These UIMs are not required for its interaction with ER&#x003b1; but appear necessary for the decrease in ER&#x003b1; polyubiquitination and the increase in ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional activation induced by RAP80. Our observations show that the UIM<sup>RAP80</sup> is critical for the function of RAP80 and suggests that RAP80 is an important modulator of ER&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data is available at NAR Online.</p>

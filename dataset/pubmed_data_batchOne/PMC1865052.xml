We have shown in this and previous studies that TCS interacts with human acidic ribosomal proteins P0, P1 and P2, which constitute the lateral stalk of eukaryotic ribosome. Deletion mutagenesis showed that TCS interacts with the C-terminal tail of P2, the sequences of which are conserved in P0, P1 and P2. The P2-binding site on TCS was mapped to the C-terminal domain by chemical shift perturbation experiments. Scanning charge-to-alanine mutagenesis has shown that K173, R174 and K177 in the C-terminal domain of TCS are involved in interacting with the P2, presumably through forming charge&#x02013;charge interactions to the conserved DDD motif at the C-terminal tail of P2. A triple-alanine variant K173A/R174A/K177A of TCS, which fails to bind P2 and ribosomal stalk <italic>in vitro</italic>, was found to be 18-fold less active in inhibiting translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, suggesting that interaction with P-proteins is required for full activity of TCS. In an analogy to the role of stalk proteins in binding elongation factors, we propose that interaction with acidic ribosomal stalk proteins help TCS to locate its RNA substrate.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Trichosanthin (TCS) is a type I ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) isolated from the root tuber of <italic>Trichosanthes kirilowii</italic>. It is used clinically to treat hydatidiform moles, trophoblastic carcinomas, ectopic pregnancies and to terminate early and mid-trimester pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). TCS, like its homolog ricin A-chain, inactivates ribosome through its RNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase activity that depurinates an invariant adenine residue, A<sup>4324</sup> (numbering according to the rat sequence), in the conserved &#x003b1;-sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) of 28S rRNA in eukaryotic ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5 B6">2&#x02013;6</xref>). Such modification prevents binding of elongation factors to the SRL, and leads to the arrest of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure of TCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) reveals that the protein consists of two domains: a large N-terminal domain (residues 1&#x02013;172) consists of six alpha-helices, a six-stranded mixed beta-sheet and a two-stranded anti-parallel sheet, and a small C-terminal domain (residues 182&#x02013;247), contains an anti-parallel beta-sheet and an alpha-helix with a bend in the middle. The two domains are connected by a loop (residues 173&#x02013;181) rich in basic residues (K173, R174 and K177). The active site of TCS is located at the cleft between the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains.</p><p>Although RIP is able to cleave naked rRNA, its <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> is 10<sup>5</sup>-fold slower than that for rRNA within an intact ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This finding strongly suggests that ribosomal proteins are involved in rendering the rRNA susceptible to inactivation by RIP. However, reports on the interaction between RIP and ribosomal proteins are scarce. In an early study, ricin A-chain was cross-linked to ribosomal proteins L9 and L10e (P0) of mammalian ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Pokeweed antiviral protein, another type I RIP, was found to interact with yeast ribosomal protein L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Based on a yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assay, we have recently shown that TCS interacts with acidic ribosomal proteins P0 and P1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In eukaryotic ribosomes, P0, P1 and P2 form a pentameric P-complex P0(P1)<sub>2</sub>(P2)<sub>2</sub>, which constitutes the ribosomal stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). P-complex docks on the ribosome through the interaction with 28S rRNA, and forms the GTPase-associated centre for binding of elongation factors during protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The P-complex determines the specificity of ribosomes for eukaryotic elongation factors. For example, swapping the prokaryotic stalk proteins (L10 &#x000b7; L7/12<sub>4</sub>) with P-complex changes the specificity of E. coli ribosomes to use eukaryotic elongation factors for translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Cryo-electron microscopy map shows that the ribosomal stalk extends outwards from the ribosome, and may play a role in fetching the elongation factors from the cytosol to the GTPase-associated centre of ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). All ribosomal stalk proteins, P0, P1 and P2, possess a conserved amino acid sequence rich in acidic residues in their C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Monoclonal antibody against this consensus sequence can block the binding of elongation factors to the P-complex and the ribosome-dependent GTPase activities in protein synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Given the sequence similarity of the C-termini of P-proteins, we hypothesize that TCS may bind P2 as well.</p><p>In this study, we first demonstrate by <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assay that TCS can bind P2. Deletion mutagenesis has shown that TCS interacts with the conserved C-terminal tail of P2, which explains why TCS can interact with all acidic ribosomal proteins. The P2-binding site on TCS was mapped by chemical shift perturbation to the C-terminal domain of TCS. Charge-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis has identified three basic residues, K173, R174 and K177, that are involved in binding P2, presumably forming salt bridges to conserved acidic residues of P2. We have found that triple-alanine substitutions at positions 173, 174 and 177, which abolished the interaction with P2 and with ribosomal stalk, resulted in a TCS variant with about 18-fold less active in inhibiting a rabbit reticulocyte protein synthesis system. Based on our results, the role of interaction with P-proteins in the ribosome-inactivating activity of TCS is discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning and site-directed mutagenesis</title><sec><title>TCS variants</title><p>E123A, K173A, R174A, D176A, K177A, E189A, K197A, E210A, R222A, D229A, R243A and K173A/R174A/K177A were created by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using mutagenic primers and were subcloned to pET3d (Novagen).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a, P2 bound to the TCS-coupled NHS-Sepharose (lane 1), while no retention of the BSA control was observed (lane 2). The binding between TCS and P2 was further confirmed by loading TCS to P2-coupled NHS-Sepharose. It was found that TCS, but not the BSA control, bound to the P2-coupled Sepharose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b, lanes 1 and 2). Non-specific binding of TCS and P2 to the Sepharose column was ruled out by loading TCS or P2 to an uncoupled NHS-Sepharose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a and b, lane 3).

To identify which charge residues in the C-terminal domain interact directly with P2, we have performed scanning charge-to-alanine mutagenesis.

TCS is an RNA <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase, the substrate of which is the &#x003b1;-sarcin/ricin-loop (SRL) of eukaryotic 28S rRNA. TCS inactivates ribosome by removing the adenine base specifically at A<sup>4324</sup>, which abolishes binding of elongation factors to the ribosome.

This finding strongly suggests that interaction between RIP and ribosomal proteins is essential to achieve full activity of RIP. Although all RIPs can inactivate eukaryotic ribosomes, some RIPs, like pokeweed antiviral protein, Mirabilis antiviral protein, and Shiga toxin, can also inactivate prokaryotic ribosomes. The kingdom specificity of ribosome substrate for some RIPs is likely due to the interaction of RIP with ribosomal proteins.</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that TCS interacts with acidic ribosomal stalk protein P2. Together with our previous finding that TCS interacts with other acidic ribosomal stalk proteins P0 and P1, TCS was shown to interact with all acidic P-proteins that constitute the lateral stalk of the large 60S ribosomal subunit. The ability of TCS to bind all P-proteins can be explained by the systematic deletion study, which has mapped the TCS-binding site to the conserved C-terminal tail of P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We have fused the last eleven residues of P2 to MBP, and found that the resulting MBP&#x02013;C11 fusion protein can interact with TCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>e).

Electrostatics calculation showed that the surface of TCS near these basic residues is strongly positively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a), and it is likely that the acidic C-terminal tail of P2 binds to this region of TCS via charge&#x02013;charge interactions.

Noteworthy, the P-protein-binding site (dark green) on eEF2 is in close proximity to the P-protein-binding site (magenta) of TCS.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm065f7"/></fig></p><p>On the other hand, electrostatic interaction is unlikely to be the only factor contributing to TCS&#x02013;P2 binding. For example, deletion of the last Asp residue at P2&#x02009;C-terminus (P2&#x00394;C1) did not affect the TCS&#x02013;P2 interaction. However, further deletion of non-polar residues (FGLF, P2&#x00394;C2&#x02013;P2&#x00394;C5) seriously compromised the TCS&#x02013;P2 binding. There is an exposed hydrophobic pocket at the C-terminal domain of TCS, which is constituted by F166, A184, L188, L215, I225 and V232 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a). It is noteworthy that residues near this hydrophobic pocket were found to have larger chemical shift changes upon addition of P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>b and c, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>a). It is likely that this hydrophobic pocket interacts with the non-polar residues at the C-terminal tail of P2.</p><p>Taken together, the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding data on TCS and P2 imply that TCS can bind to the stalk of ribosome through interacting with the conserved C-terminal tail of P-proteins. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that TCS can be cross-linked to P0 in rat ribosome, and such cross-linking was abolished in the triple-alanine variant (K173A/R174A/K177A) of TCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). Moreover, the interaction between the triple-alanine variant and ribosome was also greatly compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a). These findings suggest that the three basic residues of TCS form charge&#x02013;charge interactions with the conserved acidic residues of P-proteins in ribosomal stalk. Our observation that TCS can bind to the ribosomal stalk is consistent with a previous study which showed that ricin A-chain, a homolog of TCS, was cross-linked to P0 (L10e) of ribosome from human lung carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Ribosomal stalk, which is constituted by acidic P-proteins in eukaryotic ribosomes, was shown to play an important role in binding elongation factors. For example, EF2 binding can be blocked by anti-P-protein antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Replacement of prokaryotic stalk proteins with P-proteins changed the elongation-factor-specificity of E. coli ribosome from prokaryotic EF-G to eukaryotic EF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Recently, cryo-electron microscopy of EF2&#x02013;sordarin&#x02013;ribosome complex demonstrated that EF2 directly binds to the SRL and interacts with P-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In an 11.7-&#x000c5; cryo-electron microscopy map, residues 176&#x02013;191 in domain I of EF2 was shown to be in contact with P-proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>b).</p><p>To compare the P-protein-binding site on TCS and on EF2, we have docked TCS to the SRL substrate as described in the Materials and methods section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>c), based on the predicted models of ricin&#x02013;SRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and pokeweed antiviral protein&#x02013;SRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). As both TCS and EF2 bind to the SRL, it is anticipated that TCS will occupy the EF2-binding site on ribosome. Superimposition of TCS&#x02013;SRL and EF2&#x02013;SRL models reveals that the P-protein-binding site of TCS is close in space to that of EF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>d), which suggests that upon TCS binding to the ribosome, the P-proteins are able to physically reach the P-protein-binding sites on TCS.</p><p>Our results support the conclusion that interaction with P-protein is required for full activity of TCS. We showed that alanine substitutions at K173, R174 and K177 positions compromise P2 protein binding and reduce the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation inhibition of TCS. In particular, triple-alanine substitutions of these basic residues weaken the interactions between TCS and ribosomal stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), and resulted in &#x0223c;18-fold increases in IC<sub>50</sub> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a). As these residues are far away from the SRL-binding site of TCS, the decrease in translation inhibition is likely caused by weakening of P-protein interaction but not by direct perturbation in RNA binding.</p><p>There are several possibilities of how TCS&#x02013;P-protein interaction may play a role in ribosome-inactivating activity. First, interaction with the P-proteins may guide TCS to locate the SRL. It has been proposed that the flexible stalk proteins, which are protruding out of the ribosome, increase the association rate of elongation factors by grabbing them in the solution and fetch them to the binding site on ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Similarly, binding to the stalk proteins (P0/P1/P2) anchors TCS to a location of ribosome near the SRL substrate, and allows TCS to find its SRL substrate more efficiently. Moreover, the ability of TCS to interact with multiple copies of C-terminal tails of the stalk proteins (P0/P1/P2) may increase the association rate between TCS and ribosome. Second, interaction with P-proteins may induce conformational changes on TCS, which will increase its enzymatic activity. Alternatively, binding of TCS to the ribosome may also change the conformation of ribosome, making the SRL more susceptible to depurination by TCS. Third, binding of TCS to P-proteins may hinder the association of elongation factors to the ribosome. TCS and all RIPs, which target the SRL, occupy the elongation-factor-binding site on ribosome. Interaction with P-proteins may help TCS to compete with other elongation factors, and block the access of these factors to the SRL. For example, it has been shown that monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the C-terminal of P-proteins inhibit protein synthesis by blocking access of elongation factors to the ribosomal stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Work is underway to clarify some of these possibilities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by grants (CUHK 4145/01M and CUHK 4301/03M) from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR.

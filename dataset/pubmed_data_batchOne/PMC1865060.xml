A key question is how the enzyme is able to scan large quantities of DNA in search of aberrant uracil residues. Central to this is the mechanism by which it flips the target nucleotide out of the DNA helix and into the enzyme-active site. Both active and passive mechanisms have been proposed. Here, we report a rapid kinetic analysis using two fluorescent chromophores to temporally resolve DNA binding and base-flipping with DNA substrates of different sequences. This study demonstrates the importance of the protein&#x02013;DNA interface in the search process and indicates an active mechanism by which UNG glycosylase searches for uracil residues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) is responsible for the removal of uracil from DNA by hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond that links the base to the deoxyribose backbone, leaving an abasic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Abasic sites are themselves potentially mutagenic and are repaired by the base excision repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). UNG is a highly conserved enzyme found in many species. Detailed studies have been performed on the human (h), <italic>E. coli</italic> and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) enzymes that are highly homologous at both the amino acid and structural levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>).</p><p>All characterized UNG enzymes appear to have very similar properties: they are able to cleave uracil from both single- and double-stranded DNA, whether it is in a U&#x000b7;A base pair or any type of base mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). UNGs have an active site pocket that is highly specific for uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This prevents UNG from cleaving any normal bases from DNA, or indeed uracil from RNA. The enzyme binds uracil by flipping the target nucleotide out of the double helix and into the active site pocket via the major groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The precise mechanism of nucleotide flipping has been the subject of intense debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18">10&#x02013;18</xref>).</p><p>Nucleotide flipping has been qualitatively described in the anthropomorphic terms of &#x02018;pushing&#x02019; and &#x02018;pulling&#x02019;. Energetically, an enzyme can destabilize the stacked conformation, equivalent to a &#x02018;push&#x02019;, or stabilize the unstacked conformation, equivalent to a &#x02018;pull&#x02019;. Further, the act of destabilizing the stacked conformation implies an &#x02018;active&#x02019; engagement of the enzyme in promoting base-flipping, whereas the stabilization of the unstacked conformation may give a completely &#x02018;passive&#x02019; role for the enzyme, whereby it merely captures a base whilst it is in an extra-helical conformation. Estimates of the energetics of flipping a base are in the order of several times the thermal energy, <italic>kT</italic>, so that active participation of an enzyme in flipping a base is not an absolute requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Structural analysis of hUNG bound to DNA revealed that in flipping the target nucleotide, the enzyme also compressed the DNA backbone through phosphate interactions either side of the target uracil. This &#x02018;pinch&#x02019; could provide a direct mechanism for destabilizing the stacked base, actively promoting base-flipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). A highly conserved leucine loop also intercalates into the DNA helix, and may provide a &#x02018;push&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Rapid kinetic analyses have also concluded that UNG employs an active mechanism in flipping uracil from the DNA helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, a more recent study has suggested that UNG merely captures the base as it spontaneously flips whilst the enzyme is bound to the DNA, so that the enzyme is completely passive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Studies with other base-flipping enzymes have suggested that there may be different mechanisms employed. Many other DNA repair enzymes are known to flip DNA bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and there is strong evidence that some employ an active search mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>). DNA methyltransferases, the first enzymes identified as base-flippers, methylate either cytosine or adenine bases at defined sequences. Studies with EcoRI and M.EcoKI have demonstrated that bending of the DNA conformation is required for base flipping, in line with an active role for the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The HhaI methylase has been studied by <sup>19</sup>FNMR relaxation and data are consistent with passive flipping and trapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), although more recent studies suggest an active mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). A purely passive mechanism has been proposed for the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-glucosyltransferase enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) as the intercalating loop on these enzymes enters the DNA on the same side from which the base must be everted. Active flipping through DNA distortion is excluded on the basis of minimal contacts in a non-specific mismatch complex, where the base is extra-helical, but not bound in the enzyme-active site, although much more extensive protein&#x02013;DNA contacts exist in the specific enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). There are thus considerable differences in interpretation and there remains a lack of information regarding the dynamics of interactions at the protein&#x02013;DNA interface, which are key to understanding the biophysical basis of base flipping.</p><p>To further examine the dynamics of the protein&#x02013;DNA interface in base flipping by UNG, we have performed a rapid kinetic analysis with DNA substrates of different sequence. Previous biochemical studies have demonstrated that UNG is very dependent on the sequence context of the target uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), in fact this is a greater determinant in catalytic efficiency than base pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We have previously examined this sequence discrimination using oligonucleotide substrates where the target uracil has been placed in either an AT- or GC-rich sequence context. Both the double- and single-stranded forms of these two substrates displayed similar properties towards UNG, with the GC-rich substrates having a consistently higher <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have examined the sequence-dependent activity of UNG in greater detail, with the aim of further understanding the importance of the protein&#x02013;DNA interface in base flipping. We have used single-stranded DNA, the preferred substrate for UNG, where the energetic barrier to base eversion will be reduced. Interactions with the DNA backbone will thus be of greater significance than intercalation of the leucine loop. We have used oligonucleotides with two fluorescence chromophores to provide temporal delineation of DNA binding and base eversion, and quench flow to follow hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond. Data have been analysed using a global fitting analysis that has enabled us to define the rates of the individual steps in the reaction pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein and DNA preparation</title><p>HSV-1 UNG wild-type and the D88N/H210N mutant were purified and stored as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

It has been shown in previous studies from both this lab and others that the fluorescence of 2-AP, when adjacent to uracil, provides a signal that can be used to follow the cleavage of the uracil from the DNA by UNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>We wished to define more precisely the changes in 2-AP fluorescence intensity in relation to the different states of the DNA as substrate, product and enzyme complexes. We therefore defined the emission coefficients for the possible physical states of the fluorescent DNA. This was performed by titrating increasing concentrations of DNA, or enzyme&#x02013;DNA complexes, into a cuvette and measuring the fluorescence intensity. Plotting the fluorescence intensity against concentration produces a straight line, the gradient of which defines the emission coefficient under the conditions used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). [Note that emission coefficients are not standardized, since they are dependent upon numerous factors that affect the sensitivity of the instrument used, as well as the settings used during data collection. However, the relative emission coefficients (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) are ratios of emission coefficients and will be reproducible on other fluorospectrophotometers, provided that data are collected in an appropriate manner.]

In addition, the emission coefficients for different enzyme&#x02013;DNA complexes have been determined by titrating in fixed ratios of enzyme and DNA. Since it is not possible to analyse specific enzyme&#x02013;substrate complexes with wild-type UNG, an inactive mutant of UNG was used, where both the catalytic residues had been mutated to Asn (D88N/H210N). We have demonstrated earlier that this mutant does not support catalysis, but that it binds tightly to substrate DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and hence is ideal for investigating enzyme&#x02013;substrate interactions. Enzyme&#x02013;product complexes were analysed with both wtUNG and D88N/H210N UNG. The concentration of enzyme was always kept in excess of the concentration of DNA and experiments were performed under conditions such that the DNA would be bound; appropriate concentrations were calculated from our previously determined values of <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for these substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Inspection of the data from these titrations reveals that the free substrates 1U and 2U have different slopes from their respective products 1-AP and 2-AP, whilst the steepest slopes are observed with the specific enzyme&#x02013;DNA complexes formed by D88N/H210N UNG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and C). These experiments reveal that steep slopes are also obtained with the product oligonucleotides and that wtUNG and D88N/H210N UNG give very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and D). Examination of the 1N control oligonucleotide showed that the free and D88N/H210N UNG complexed oligonucleotide had the same emission coefficient, demonstrating that the fluorescence changes that we are observing are specific for the conformational changes associated with the target uracil, and are not due to non-specific enzyme&#x02013;DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>A summary of these experiments is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, with the calculated relative emission coefficient. The lowest fluorescent state is defined by the free uracil-containing substrate oligonucleotide. An intermediate fluorescent state is observed for the free abasic product DNA, which has a 1.37&#x02013;1.66-fold enhancement over the substrate DNA. It is this difference that accounts for the signal used in the steady-state experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The highest fluorescent state arises from the formation of the specific enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex and is the same for both enzyme&#x02013;substrate and enzyme&#x02013;product complexes, with an average fluorescence enhancement of 2.45-fold over the free substrate oligonucleotides. Although we observe a slightly lower relative emission coefficient with wtUNG and product 1U, we do not believe that this is significant, since we do not observe a similar reduction with wtUNG and the product of 2U. This analysis clearly reveals that there are three fluorescent states for the oligonucleotides that we have used in this study: free substrate (low), free product (intermediate) and an enzyme-bound specific DNA complex (high).</p><p>We observe similar values in absolute fluorescence intensity with both substrates and similar changes on going from the single-stranded substrate to an enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex and the abasic product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This indicates that there is significant quenching of 2-AP in the single-stranded substrates 1U and 2U, and that similar structural transitions occur with both substrates on reaction with UNG that reduce this quenching effect. 2-AP fluorescence intensity is sensitive to the structure of DNA and quenching is observed within an oligonucleotide due to both stacking and collisional interactions with neighbouring bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Changes in fluorescence intensity occur when the structure of DNA is altered, which can include base flipping as well as other structural perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Since the change in 2-AP fluorescence can here be correlated with structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), a reliable assignment of the high-fluorescence intermediate can be made to the eversion and binding of the neighbouring uracil by UNG. Although it may seem somewhat illogical to discuss base-flipping with single-stranded DNA substrates, the changes in fluorescence intensity that we observe demonstrate that there must be significant secondary structure in the DNA substrates. A similar structural transition will therefore be required to bind the target uracil within the enzyme-active site. However, the energetic barrier to this &#x02018;flipping&#x02019; would be expected to be considerably less with single-stranded DNA rather than double-stranded DNA.</p><p>The intermediate level fluorescence observed in the abasic product is also consistent with reduced nucleotide interactions and increased solvent exposure expected due to the presence of an abasic site next to the 2-AP. These data also imply that there will not be a significant 2-AP fluorescence signal corresponding to the chemical cleavage step in the enzyme pathway and we demonstrate below that this is indeed the case.</p></sec><sec><title>Global analysis of substrate DNA binding</title><p>The initial encounter of enzyme and DNA will be a second-order binding event to form a non-specific complex. Formation of the specific enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex characterized by the high 2-AP fluorescence state must then occur as a subsequent first-order process, as in Scheme 1 below.
<disp-formula id="M2"><label>(Scheme 1)</label><graphic xlink:href="gkm018m2"/></disp-formula>
where the enzyme (E) binds the substrate DNA (S) to form a non-specific enzyme&#x02013;substrate complex (E&#x000b7;S), that may then proceed to the specific complex (E&#x000b7;S*). Cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond results in an enzyme&#x02013;product complex (E&#x000b7;P) which, following dissociation, leads to the free enzyme, the abasic DNA product (P) and uracil (U).</p><p>The 2-AP fluorescence states described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> report on the formation of the specific enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex E&#x000b7;S*, but provides no information on the non-specific intermediate E&#x000b7;S. To deconvolute the conformational change associated with base flipping from non-specific complex formation thus requires a different signal that is sensitive only to DNA binding.</p><p>Fluorescence anisotropy monitors the extent to which plane polarzied light is depolarized due to the tumbling of a molecule in solution between excitation and emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). DNA labelled on the 5&#x02032; end with HEX has proved to be a very useful probe for investigating DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), and we have previously used it in equilibrium binding studies of UNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The use of the two chromophores, 2-AP and HEX, can thus be used to provide temporal resolution between DNA binding and base flipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The initial binding of the enzyme and DNA leads to a change in the anisotropy (&#x00394;<italic>r</italic>) and total HEX fluorescence (&#x00394;<italic>I</italic><sub>H</sub>), subsequent conformational changes that lead to base flipping and formation of the specific enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex then produce a change in 2-AP fluorescence (&#x00394;<italic>I</italic><sub>2AP</sub>). These different fluorescence signals thus report on different steps in the reaction pathway.</p><p>Previous rapid kinetic studies have demonstrated that the transition from non-specific to a specific complex, denoted by <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> in Scheme 1, is very rapid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Delineation between the first- and second-order rates is in theory possible at high concentrations where the second-order binding, monitored by HEX anisotropy, will be faster than the first-order base-flipping, monitored by 2-AP fluorescence. The former will increase linearly with concentration, while the latter will ultimately give a hyperbolic response as the E&#x000b7;S complex saturates. Fitting of such hyperbolic data may be performed with an equation derived from Scheme 1, using the square root approximation, and requires that the experiments are performed under pseudo first-order conditions, as described by Johnson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The limiting factor on such an analysis is the dead-time of stopped-flow machines which are in the 1-ms range. At even moderate concentrations, and hence rates, most of the signal becomes lost in the dead-time of the instrument, as demonstrated below.</p><p>While this approach has been applied earlier to <italic>E. coli</italic> UNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), it did not appear likely that it would be sensitive enough to deconvolute the differences in DNA-binding and -flipping events between the 1U and 2U substrates that we were examining here. Furthermore, the significant differences observed between the two substrates indicated that substrate 2U was not reaching saturation in DNA binding under accessible conditions (data not shown and below), so that pseudo first-order conditions would not be possible to fulfill.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we have employed a strategy based on a global fit of both 2-AP fluorescence and anisotropy data using numerical integration of a kinetic model. Numerical integration has the advantage that it does not require any assumptions to solve a mathematical equation. Furthermore, it does not require that experiments are performed under pseudo first-order conditions, since the conditions are inherently accounted for in the model. Under non-saturating conditions, a reversible system will reach an equilibrium position that is not at the end-point, with the important consideration being that amplitudes are critical in the subsequent data analysis.</p><p>We performed stopped-flow experiments using the catalytically deficient D88N/H210N HSV-1 UNG. Fixed concentrations of oligonucleotides 1HU and 2HU (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were mixed with increasing concentrations of enzyme. A dual detection setup enabled the simultaneous acquisition of the horizontal and vertical components of the HEX fluorescence, allowing the acquisition of time-resolved anisotropy data. The same enzyme and DNA solutions were then used to acquire 2-AP fluorescence data in a conventional fluorescence setup. The data were treated to produce anisotropy (<italic>r</italic>), total HEX fluorescence (<italic>I</italic><sub>H</sub>) and 2-AP fluorescence (<italic>I</italic><sub>2AP</sub>), each as a function of enzyme concentration and for each substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).
<fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Substrates 1HU (left column) and 2HU (right column) were mixed with increasing concentrations of D88N/H210N UNG using stopped-flow.

This enabled the simultaneous fitting of anisotropy, total HEX fluorescence and 2-AP fluorescence at different enzyme concentrations: rate constants were thus determined by the simultaneous fitting of 18&#x02009;000 data points. The model used to fit these data was based on Scheme 1, but omitting the cleavage and subsequent steps, since an inactive mutant was used (Supplementary Data).</p><p>The model produced a very good fit for the anisotropy and total HEX fluorescence, which defines the initial encounter between enzyme and substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The fit to the 2-AP fluorescence was good, but exhibited some systematic deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This is consistent with other 2-AP data that was collected under pseudo first-order conditions, which required a fit to a single exponential plus slope to produce the best fit (data not shown). This is most likely due to a slower conformational change that follows the initial transition to the high-fluorescence intermediate. This slower change is not necessarily accompanied by a change in the fluorescence state of E&#x000b7;S*, as the intensity change may be a kinetic effect due to the further accumulation of the high-fluorescence intermediate. Alternative models were tested that would account for a further equilibrium step, but these did not produce a better fit to the data. Furthermore, the lack of an independent signal to define a further intermediate led to an undesirable ambiguity in the fitted rates. It was therefore concluded that the model which relates to Scheme 1 was the simplest that could accurately account for the observed data with no ambiguity in the fitted rate constants.</p><p>A clear distinction between the 1HU and 2HU substrates emerges when the rates determined from the global analysis are examined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The initial encounter between enzyme and DNA is the same for each substrate since the second-order binding rate <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> is in both cases approaching the diffusion-controlled rate limit. The reverse rate <italic>k</italic><sub>&#x02212;1</sub> is larger with the GC-rich 2HU substrate indicating that non-specific E&#x000b7;S complex may be rather less stable, although this should not be over-interpreted since fitting is relatively insensitive to this rate. Thereafter the progression from the non-specific E&#x000b7;S complex changes dramatically between the substrates: the forward rate <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> to produce the high-fluorescence E&#x000b7;S* complex is very fast with 1HU, but more than 10-fold slower with 2HU. This demonstrates that once the non-specific E&#x000b7;S complex has been formed, UNG is able to form the activated E&#x000b7;S* complex at a much lower energetic cost with 1HU than 2HU. The poor activity demonstrated by UNG towards the 2U substrate can thus be attributed to an increased energetic cost in base flipping and formation of the activated complex. This is consistent with the increased <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for this substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

Further examination of the reaction cycle requires analysis of the chemical cleavage step. The use of quench flow allows just such an investigation. Enzyme and DNA are mixed, and following a fixed time are then chemically quenched with NaOH. This immediately inactivates the enzyme, and on heating to 90&#x000b0;C results in cleavage of abasic product DNA, whilst leaving substrate intact. Substrate and product can then be separated by denaturing PAGE and quantified by storage phosphor autoradiography.

We have investigated the complete reaction cycle of UNG by using wild-type UNG and monitoring the 2-AP stopped-flow fluorescence under a full reaction cycle with equimolar amounts of enzyme and substrates 1U or 2U. The different fluorescence states of 2-AP generated during the UNG reaction were observed, and these can be assigned to specific steps in the UNG reaction, as defined by the relative intensities of the 2-AP-containing DNA in different states and complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). An initial increase is observed that corresponds to the rapid increase in fluorescence resulting from the formation of the specific UNG&#x02013;DNA complex from the free DNA. A subsequent decrease in fluorescence is then observed, corresponding to the decrease in fluorescence that results from dissociation of the abasic DNA product after catalysis has occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The final fluorescence is higher than the starting fluorescence, corresponding to the increase in fluorescence between substrate and product DNAs (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

This study has investigated the reaction pathway of UNG with uracil residues located in different sequence contexts, and provides a new insight into the steps prior to excision of the base.</p><p>The critical step in the reaction pathway is the formation of the specific enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex, where the uracil base has been flipped into the enzyme-active site and catalysis may proceed. This is governed by the rate <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> in Scheme 1, and is highly dependent on the sequence context of the target uracil (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The reduced rate for <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> with the GC-rich substrate indicates an increased activation energy for this process.</p><p>The results reported here demonstrate that damage recognition by UNG is dependent upon the sequence context of the target uracil. The initial encounter of enzyme and DNA to form a non-specific complex is not greatly affected by the DNA sequence (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>&#x02212;1</sub>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). This binding will largely involve electrostatic forces and will not be dependent on intricate molecular recognition. Damage recognition is the process by which UNG forms the specific enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex: this requires the flipping of the uracil from the DNA into the enzyme-active site. Much debate has centred around the mechanism of base flipping and the question of whether the enzyme plays an active or passive role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18">13&#x02013;18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Structural analysis of UNG suggested a &#x02018;pinch&#x02013;push&#x02013;pull&#x02019; mechanism for base flipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), later modified by kinetic analysis to a &#x02018;pinch&#x02013;pull&#x02013;push&#x02019; mechanism. A more recent study concluded that UNG simply captures the base as it spontaneously flips whilst the enzyme is bound to the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This is unexpected since one would expect the act of binding to DNA would affect the immediate environment and energetics of the DNA. Furthermore, the authors&#x02019; data indicated a significant increase in the rate of base opening for a thymine when bound by UNG. However, the principle effect of the enzyme was to reduce the rate of base closure. This corresponds with kinetic studies that indicated the leucine loop intercalated after base-flipping, thus stabilizing the extra-helical conformation, rather than actively destabilizing (&#x02018;pushing&#x02019;) the intra-helical conformation. There is thus some consensus in the role of UNG in stabilizing the flipped base through specific interactions with the uracil and the intercalating leucine loop, but whether UNG actively destabilizes (&#x02018;pushes&#x02019;) the target base remains controversial.</p><p>The data we present here provide a new perspective in this debate. The rates <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>&#x02212;2</sub> in Scheme 1 directly correlate to base opening and closure, respectively. Both of these substrates are single stranded, so the energetic barrier to base eversion will be lower than with a double-stranded substrate. Yet we see a significant difference between the rates of base opening between the two substrates, but not for base closure. This can only be due to differences in the rate of spontaneous base eversion, as in a passive mechanism, or modulation of the protein&#x02013;nucleic acid interface due to differences in local DNA structure in an active mechanism. The former is unlikely given that the substrates are single stranded, and base stacking is stronger in single-stranded polyA DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), which is more like the AT-rich 1U substrate. We have also concluded earlier that differences between the double-stranded forms of these two substrates are unlikely to be due to differences in helical stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We therefore conclude that the large differences in the rates of base opening are due to differences in the protein&#x02013;nucleic acid interface. This is supported by previous studies that have observed large <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> effects when the target uracil is placed within the unusual DNA structure of a hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The logical conclusion therefore is that protein&#x02013;DNA interactions are critical in uracil eversion that requires active engagement of the UNG enzyme with the DNA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Conformational transitions associated with base flipping are naturally dynamic processes. To fully understand such processes therefore requires dynamic methods that can provide an insight into these transitions as they occur. This provides an alternative perspective and, in conjunction with structural techniques, is critical in obtaining a complete understanding of this important process in DNA damage recognition. We have demonstrated that these dynamic transitions are dependent upon DNA sequence. The protein&#x02013;DNA interface is thus critical in modulating the energetics of base flipping, which is dependent upon an active role of the enzyme in affecting this structural transition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data is availabe at NAR Online</p>

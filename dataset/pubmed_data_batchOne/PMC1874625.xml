We have tested the hypothesis that p53 mutants suppress p53-target gene expression, leading to enhanced cellular growth. Silencing of mutant p53 expression in several human cell lines was found to lead to the upregulation of wild-type p53-target genes such as <italic>p21, gadd45, PERP</italic> and <italic>PTEN</italic>. The expression of these genes was also suppressed in H1299-based isogenic cell lines expressing various hot-spot p53 mutants, and silencing of mutant p53, but not TAp73, abrogated the suppression. Consistently, these hot-spot p53 mutants were able to suppress a variety of p53-target gene promoters. Analysis using the proto-type <italic>p21</italic> promoter construct indicated that the p53-binding sites are dispensable for mutant p53-mediated suppression. However, treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin-A resulted in relief of mutant p53-mediated suppression, suggesting that mutant p53 may induce hypo-acetylation of target gene promoters leading to the suppressive effects. Finally, we show that stable down-regulation of mutant p53 expression resulted in reduced cellular colony growth in human cancer cells, which was found to be due to the induction of apoptosis. Together, the results demonstrate another mechanism through which p53 mutants could promote cellular growth.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>p53</italic> suppressor gene is mutated in &#x0223c;50% of all human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Mutations in p53 have been shown to abrogate its cardinal functions in promoting apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair, thereby leading to cancer development and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Activation of p53, which is a transcription factor, results in the transactivation of many target genes that regulate these biological processes. Thus, abrogation of DNA-binding function of p53 results in amelioration of p53-dependent transcription, and hence, target genes required for the efficient execution of the biological processes are not activated. The significance of the DNA-binding property of p53 in regulating many of its biological functions is highlighted by the large percentage (&#x0223c;90%) of mutations found in DNA-binding domain (DBD) of p53 in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Of these, there are several hot-spot residues such as R175, G245, R248, R249, R273 and R282 that are more prone to mutations than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). R248 and R273 are DNA-contact mutants and R175, G245, R249 and R282 are conformational mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and like most other mutations found in the DBD, all of them have compromised DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Mutated p53 is often overexpressed in tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), due to their inability to effectively activate MDM2, which negatively regulates p53 abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Whether the accumulated p53 in tumour cells have any specific functions supporting cellular growth has been intensively researched recently. There is accumulating evidence that mutant p53 may not only have lost the tumour-suppressive functions but may have also acquired additional pro-oncogenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), leading to the concept that mutant p53 may have acquired novel oncogenic &#x02018;gain-of-function&#x02019; activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In this respect, several biochemical and biological functions of mutant p53 that are independent of wild-type p53's activities were described. It was shown that mutant p53 could transactivate oncogenic targets such as <italic>c-myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), anti-apoptotic gene <italic>BAG-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), growth-promoting genes as <italic>asparagine synthetase</italic> and <italic>hTERT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and the multi-drug resistance gp180 protein (MDR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). At the same time, not much is known if mutant p53 has any negative, inhibitory role on common p53-target gene expression. In this respect, only one report by Zalcenstein <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the p53 mutant R175H could down-regulate the expression from the p53-dependent <italic>CD95(FAS/APO-1)</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). However, whether such a phenomenon is universal and affects the status of other wild-type p53-target genes is unclear.</p><p>Recent findings have also suggested that activation of mutant p53 by small molecules such as PRIMA-1 could restore sequence-specific DNA binding and the active conformation to mutant p53 proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in living cells, leading to anti-tumour effects, which was dependent on the presence of mutant p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Although PRIMA-1 reconstituted the wild-type function of mutant p53, it cannot be excluded that mutant p53 may have been involved in the suppression of p53-target gene expression, and modulation of such an activity could also be one reason for the activation of its tumour-suppressive functions. There is insufficient evidence to propose a mechanism by which mutant p53 could have acquired a &#x02018;gain-of-function&#x02019; by down-regulating the classical p53-target gene expression.</p><p>We thus asked whether mutant p53 would be able to modulate the expression of classical wild-type p53 responsive target genes. We report here that down-regulation of mutant p53 expression in several human cancer cell lines harbouring mutant p53 by siRNA-mediated silencing induced the expression of p53-dependent apoptotic and repair genes. Consistently, several p53-target genes were found to be down-regulated in isogenic cell lines stably expressing the various hot-spot p53 mutants, which also correlated with down-regulation of p53-target gene promoter activity by various mutant p53 expression in transient transfection assays. Down-regulation of target gene activity was found not to be dependent on the presence of p53-binding sites, but was markedly reduced in the presence of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin-A (TSA), suggesting that mutant p53-mediated p53-target gene suppression is at least in part due to hypo-acetylation of histones. Finally, silencing of p53 expression in human cancer cells resulted in reduction in cellular colony formation, indicating that mutant p53 expression indeed could support cellular growth. Thus, our finding suggests a novel function of mutant p53 that can contribute to cancer progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and plasmids</title><p>The p53 null H1299 human lung cancer cell line and the 13 derivate isogenic cell lines expressing vector (pCDNA) or the six hot-spot mutations (R175H, G245S, R248W, R249S, R273H and R282 W) either as an arginine or a proline polymorphic variant at codon 72 has been established in the laboratory and described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).

To this end, we utilized three human cancer cell lines, namely the HUH-7 hepatoma cell line which harbours the A220G mutation; the T47D breast cancer cell line which carries the C194T mutation and the CNE-2 nasopahryngeal carcinoma cell line that harbours the R280T mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>). <italic>p53</italic> mRNA levels were reduced upon siRNA-mediated silencing using p53-specific siRNA and not in control scrambled siRNA-transfected or untransfected cells in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A&#x02013;C). Concomitant to reduction in <italic>p53</italic> levels, the levels of <italic>gadd45, PTEN</italic> and <italic>PERP</italic> were upregulated in HUH-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The upregulation of PTEN and gadd45 was also confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). However, the expression levels of other p53-target genes such as <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>pig3</italic> were unaltered upon p53 silencing in HUH-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). This variable upregulation of p53-target genes was also noticed in the other two cell lines. p53 silencing resulted in upregulation of <italic>gadd45</italic> and to some extent of <italic>p21</italic> in T47D cells, and only marginal upregulation of <italic>p21</italic> in CNE-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The levels of <italic>pig3</italic> did not change in both cells lines whereas <italic>gadd45</italic> remained unchanged in CNE-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). This effect of increase in expression of various genes was restricted to p53-target genes as expression of unrelated genes such as <italic>TAp73</italic> and <italic>c-jun</italic> were unaltered by silencing of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). It was interesting to note that <italic>TAp73</italic> expression was naturally silenced in HUH-7 cells, and together with the absence of any change in <italic>TAp73</italic> levels in the other two cell lines, the data exclude the possibility that the increase in the expression of p53-target genes upon p53 silencing was due to relief of mutant p53-mediated suppression of p73 function.

The isogenic cell lines express approximately equal amounts of the six commonly found human cancer-derived hot-spot mutations such as R175H, G245S, R248W, R249S, R273H and R282W, in either of the polymorphic forms of the common polymorphism at codon 72, i.e. arginine or proline (R or P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).

We utilized seven p53-dependent promoters, including <italic>p21, GADD45, p53AIP-1, BAX, IGFBP3, cyclinG1</italic> and <italic>p53R2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;G). Expression of wild-type p53 in either the proline or arginine polymorphic variant resulted in massive activation of all promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;G). By contrast, expression of the six hot-spot p53 mutants in either of the polymorphic forms generally resulted in the suppression of promoter activity throughout, compared to vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;G), consistent with the findings obtained with endogenous levels of target genes. The extent of suppression was dependent on the kind of mutation and the promoters used in the experiments. It should be noted that although there were variations in the levels of suppression of target gene promoters between cells expressing either the R or P form of various p53 mutants, expression of all forms of mutants led to a decrease in target gene promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;G), indicating that the effect may be general and attributable to mutant p53. We have excluded the possibility that the differences in p53 levels are causal to the differences in promoter activity, as all mutant p53 constructs were expressed to about equal extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>I, showing representative results). Moreover, this suppressive effect was not unspecific as it was not observed with the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter, which is generally suppressed by wild-type p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Although wild-type p53 suppressed <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter activity, most mutant p53 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>H). Thus, the data indicate that various hot-spot p53 mutants have the ability to suppress the expression from p53-target gene promoters.

However, the results suggest that the suppression by mutant p53 is specific to p53-target gene promoters. Hence, we investigated if the p53-binding sites on the promoters are required for the suppression. To this end, we utilized the proto-type promoter constructs from the p21 promoter having (0-Luc) or lacking one or both of the p53- binding sites (2-Luc or 4-Luc, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Lack of one p53-binding site did not affect the ability of wild-type p53 to activate the promoter or the ability of representative p53 mutants (R248 and R273) to suppress it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, middle panel). However, although deletion of both p53-binding sites abrogated wild-type p53's ability to activate the promoter, the mutant p53 were still able to suppress this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, rightmost panel).

We therefore explored the possibility that p53 mutants exerted their suppressive effects on p53-target genes by affecting the chromatin acetylation status. To this end, we first utilized the HDAC inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), and evaluated its effect on the ability of mutant p53 (R248 and R273) to suppress the <italic>p53AIP-1</italic>and <italic>p21</italic> promoters. Treatment with TSA resulted in a massive induction of the promoter activity even in the presence of the p53 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), compared to TSA-untreated cells where there was a consistent suppression by the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). There was also a slight increase in the promoter activity of vector-transfected cells treated with TSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). However, the effect of increase in promoter activity was much more pronounced when mutant p53 was transfected, suggesting that TSA-mediated relief of suppression was at least partially dependent on the presence of mutant p53. This was further confirmed when we evaluated the effects of all six hot-spot mutants (in both the proline or arginine polymorphic variations) on the <italic>gadd45</italic> promoter. Treatment with TSA again resulted in the relief of suppression of promoter activity, though to varying extents depending on the p53 mutants used, as well as the polymorphic status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B).

It should be noted that cells expressing p53 mutants in either the proline or arginine polymorphic forms were responsive to TSA treatment, though to varying extents, suggesting that the polymorphism may not be crucial in mutant p53's ability to suppress target gene expression. Moreover, consistent with the promoter activity, different p53 mutants had varying abilities to suppress target gene expression, which upon TSA treatment, resulted in upregulation of target genes to varying extents.

Silencing of mutant p53 expression led to relief of this suppression and thus, activation of various p53-target genes. Cellular colony formation was reduced upon silencing of mutant p53 expression due to increased cell death, correlating with upregulation of p53-target gene expression. Thus, the down-regulation of p53-target genes by mutant p53 appears to be a general phenomenon, and hence, may constitute one mechanism for the gain of function of mutant p53.</p><p>It is intriguing that not much attention has been paid to this phenomenon, which is quite obvious upon closer analysis of results of promoter-reporter assays. Such assays have been traditionally used and most researchers have concluded from these that mutant p53 do not have the ability to activate the promoters of p53-target genes. However, the down-regulation has somewhat gone unnoticed by many, as it is not striking at first glance. However, careful analysis of a recently published article indicated that expression of various hot-spot p53 mutants indeed resulted in down-regulation of the <italic>p21</italic> promoter [Supplementary Data of ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>)&#x02014;Table 2]. Moreover, consistent with an earlier report that mutant p53 could suppress <italic>CD95</italic> promoter activity, the data presented here strongly argue that suppression of p53-target gene expression could be a general mechanism by which mutant p53 could support oncogenesis.</p><p>The upregulation of p53-target genes upon silencing of mutant p53 expression was not unspecific, as expression of other genes such as <italic>c-jun, TAp73</italic> and <italic>mdr-1</italic> was not affected. Furthermore, p53 mutants were found to activate <italic>mdr-1</italic> gene expression and the <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter activity as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Moreover, this phenomenon of suppression required the presence of mutant p53, as cells devoid of p53 did not show changes in the levels of target genes, and cellular colony growth was not affected upon p53 silencing in these cells, indicating that the expression of mutant p53 was essential. However, there are several variations that we observed in our studies: the extent to which the various p53-target genes were upregulated upon p53 silencing and the magnitude of target gene suppression by the proline or arginine polymorphic variants of mutant p53. For example, most of the genes analysed were upregulated in HUH-7 cells, whereas not all of them were upregulated in CNE-2 cells, thereby reflecting the cell-to-cell variation. It could be also that different p53 mutants have differential capacity to suppress target genes. Besides, although all the mutants had the ability to suppress gene expression, there were variations between the arginine and proline polymorphic forms, similar to that observed with wild-type p53 forms, which have also been shown to differentially regulate target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, we were unable to observe a general pattern if either of the polymorphic forms could better suppress target gene expression than the other. The cause of this variation, which was also apparent in experiments in which cells were treated with TSA, is not clear and warrants further investigation. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of mutant p53-mediated suppression of p53-target genes appears to be consistent in most mutant p53-containing cell lines examined.</p><p>While our work was in progress, two recent publications reported that suppression of mutant p53 expression could indeed lead to inhibition of cellular growth. Bossi <italic>et al</italic>. utilized several human cancer cell lines harbouring mutant p53 and found that silencing of mutant p53 expression led to a reduction in tumour malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The other report indicated that depletion of mutant p53 expression resulted in the activation of <italic>p21, bax</italic> and <italic>PIG3</italic> promoter activity and led to cellular cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In addition, similar suppression of p53 expression in H1299 cells stably expressing the mutant R175H p53 was also shown to decrease cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Together, these data support our findings and suggest that suppression of mutant p53 expression may be one important way to relief the mutant p53-mediated down-regulation of p53-target gene expression, and hence, could lead to inhibition of cellular growth.</p><p>It is at present unclear whether mutant p53-mediated suppression of p53-target gene expression is direct. As mutant p53 was shown to inactivate TAp73 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), the observed decrease in p53-target gene expression in cells expressing mutant p53 could be due to inactivation of p73 function. However, we have excluded this possibility as siRNA-mediated silencing of TAp73 expression and inactivation of TAp73 activity by expression of the dominant negative p73DD protein did not lead to a decrease of expression of p53-target genes, further indicating that down-regulation of p53-target gene expression is a direct consequence of mutant p53 expression and not due to p73 inactivation. Wild-type p53 has been shown to activate target genes by binding to p53-specific binding sequences found in the target gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, investigations with the prototype <italic>p21</italic> promoter indicated that both the p53-binding sites are dispensable for mutant p53-mediated suppression. It is thus not clear how mutant p53 is able to recognize target gene promoters specifically. Because all the p53 mutants used in this study have lost their sequence-specific DNA-binding ability (data not shown), the findings suggest that mutant p53 may still bind to p53-target gene promoters at different positions, independent of their DBD, or affect gene regulation by other means. Support for this hypothesis comes from several studies. First, it was shown that mutant p53 may promote gene amplification by activating topoisomerase I, leading to genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Next, Zalcenstein <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that mutant R175H p53 was able to bind to <italic>CD95</italic> promoter sequences in the region distinct from the p53-binding sites where wild-type p53 binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Consistently, Gohler <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that mutant p53 binds selectively and with high affinity to non-B DNA, which was found to be dependent on the stereo-specific configuration of the DNA, and not on DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). It is not clear at present if there is a consensus sequence or specific configuration in all the p53-target gene promoters to which mutant p53 could bind, and further investigations are required to elucidate this possibility.</p><p>Nonetheless, the mechanism of mutant p53-mediated suppression of target gene expression appears to partly depend on HDAC activity. Treatment of cells with the HDAC inhibitor TSA resulted in relief of suppression that was dependent on the presence of mutant p53. It was reported that TSA could also initiate p53-like functions by inducing a variety of p53-inducible genes in a p53-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Thus, it is possible that both mutant p53-dependent relief of down-regulation and p53-independent transactivation mechanisms may work simultaneously to activate these target genes. However, comparison of promoter activity upon TSA treatment in vector and mutant p53 expressing cells indicated that release from suppression was much stronger in presence of mutant p53, thereby excluding non-specific p53-independent effects as a major causal mechanism at work. Recent data by Blagosklonny <italic>et al</italic>. who had utilized another HDAC inhibitor, FR901228, also support our findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Treatment with FR901228 resulted in the induction of mRNA of p53-target genes, and consequent cytotoxicity, specifically in cells expressing mutant p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that mutant p53-mediated suppression was less pronounced in tumour cells lacking p300, the transcriptional co-activator protein that plays a central role in co-ordinating and integrating multiple signal-dependent events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, we were unable to observe a synergistic increase in target gene suppression by co-transfection of p300 with mutant p53 (data not shown). Thus, p300 may be required but not sufficient for mutant p53-dependent down-regulation of p53-target gene expression, which occurs at least in part by decreasing the acetylation status.</p><p>Taken together, the results presented here propose another mechanism through which mutant p53 may contribute to unregulated cellular growth and oncogenesis. Together with the recent reports demonstrating mutant p53's ability to support cellular viability, the presence of the overexpressed mutant p53 in tumour cells may be a good therapeutic target for clinical intervention. Future studies should thus be aimed at efficiently suppressing mutant p53 expression in human tumours in <italic>in vivo</italic> models to evaluate the efficacy of &#x02018;anti-mutant p53 therapy&#x02019;.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Drs Hui KM, Levrero M and El-Deiry W for providing plasmids and cell lines.

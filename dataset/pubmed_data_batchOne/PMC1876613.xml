Mice were subjected to psychologically stressful conditions by whiskers removal. Under this condition, spontaneous locomotive activity was significantly enhanced in the dark (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 versus the control mice in three different movements), and granulocytes/lymphocytes balance shifted to granulocytes. At the same time, peroxynitrite level in blood plasma increased to &#x0223c;180% from that of the control mice at 6 h after removal of the whiskers (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and was maintained even after 12 h. Both protein carbonyl formation and lipid peroxidation were significantly increased under this condition in brain, heart, liver and spleen at 6 h after removal of whiskers (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 or <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and these levels were maximized after 12 h (increased to 120&#x02013;160%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 or <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The oxidative tissue injuries observed at 12 h after the removal of the whiskers were effectively prevented by two traditional Chinese medicine formula: Shengmai San (SMS) and Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang (LGZGT), when administered for 5 days before the removal of the whiskers. Therefore, this stress model is considered useful in assessing the preventive potential of antioxidants and antioxidant-based herbal mixtures in treating the pathophysiology associated with psychological or emotional distress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antioxidant-based herbal medicine</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>peroxynitrite</kwd><kwd>psychological stress</kwd><kwd>sub-healthy condition</kwd><kwd>traditional Chinese medicine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Currently, psychological distress has attracted attention with regards to its significant negative effects in treating various diseases, especially cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). There are a variety of stress-induced hemodynamic changes that inhibit cellular immune responses and are relevant to cancer prognosis, e.g. NK cytotoxicity and T-cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The stressors can also induce myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), which associate with oxidative stress. It is thus suggested that psychological stress is associated with increased oxidant production and oxidative damage, and thus long-term exposure to psychological stressors may enhance the risk of many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In this sense, psychological stress-induced pathophysiology is similar to the so-called sub-healthy (or pre-disease) condition defined in the ancient theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The sub-healthy condition describes one condition that is not completely healthy but is also not ill, and therefore, Western medicine usually fails to give an appropriate diagnostic disease name. The prevention and repair of this specific condition is the basic strategy of TCM, and this idea should be re-evaluated for its importance in the current preventive treatment of lifestyle and age-related complex pathophysiologies associated with oxidative stress. Therefore, the oxidative stress associated with psychological and/or emotional stress might be an appropriate target for assessing the preventive potentiality of food supplements or TCM formulae that are used as alternative medicines.</p><p>Several animal stress models of various stressors such as immobilization, burn shock and cold-restraint have been developed, and all cause oxidative lipid, protein and DNA damages in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, almost all of them are accompanied by physical abuse in addition to psychological or emotional stressors.</p><p>In the present paper, we will show that the simple cut of whiskers causes psychological or emotional distress in mice leading to oxidative stress in tissues. Whiskers play a critical role as a locomotive sensor in mice, and thus, sensory input is directly connected to motor neurons controlling their locomotive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Therefore, the removal of whiskers may affect their locomotive behavior causing anxiety on hyperlocomotion, and thus, psychological or emotionally stressed condition. This model thus mimics a psychological or emotional stress as a sub-healthy condition.</p><p>Using this animal model, TCM formulae, Shengmai San (SMS) and Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang (LGZGT) were examined as models of antioxidant-based alternative medicine against complex diseases associated with oxidative stress. SMS is a TCM formula comprising three herbal components: <italic>Panax ginseng, Ophiopogon japonicus</italic> and <italic>Schisandra chinensis</italic>, and is traditionally used for treating heart diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). LGZGT, on the other hand, is composed of four herbal components, <italic>Hoelen, Cinnamomi cortex, Atractylodis rhizoma</italic> and <italic>Glycyrrhizae radix</italic>, and is often used for diseases related to edema, such as chronic bronchitis, congestive heart failure and chronic nephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Moreover, both TCM formulae were previously shown to have high potentiality for preventing cerebral oxidative stress in experimental animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123) and rhodamine 123 were obtained from Molecular Probes Inc., USA.

To examine the oxidative stress induced by psychological stress, each mouse was seized by hand and the whiskers around the nose and mouth were completely cut-off with the scissors without the use of anesthesia. Yet, for the control group, the same treatment was administered without cutting the whiskers. After the removal of whiskers, the mice were kept in a cage under free access to diet and water. The mice were sacrificed under anesthesia with pentobarbital at 6, 12 and 24 h after the removal of the whiskers (whiskers were removed at 12 p.m. for a 6 h stress exposure experiment, and at 9 p.m. for the 12 and 24 h stress exposure experiments), and blood samples were withdrawn from the abdominal vein with a heparinized syringe.

Aliquots (100 &#x003bc;l) of test samples and standards (4 &#x003bc;g as protein) were placed in 96-well plastic plates, respectively, and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The plates were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), and incubated with blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBST) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were incubated for an additional 4 h with a primary antibody (anti-DNP Mouse IgE; Sigma), washed with PBST then reacted with a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgE Rat IgG HRP conjugate; SBA) for 1 h. Peroxidase reaction was performed with the addition of TMB (Bio-Rad Lab) and stopped with the addition of 0.18 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

This idea seems quite important in the current preventive treatment of lifestyle and age-related diseases. Although this sub-healthy condition is not physiologically yet fully understood, we assumed this condition is associated with oxidative stress. This is because the pathophysiology to which TCMs are applied are usually associated with oxidative stress, and the herbal components of TCM formulas generally have a high antioxidant potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, it is well understood that stressors are the causative factor of oxidative stress and that chronic exposure to such stressors leads to serious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Therefore, stressor-mediated oxidative stress is similar to the sub-healthy condition in terms of the disease initiating stage. Of all the stresses, psychological or emotional stress-mediated oxidative stress seems to be a more reliable model of the sub-healthy condition defined by the TCM theory, since such stressors reportedly modulate immune responses in cancer patients and control the therapeutic potential of cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we developed a simple model for studying psychological or emotional stress-induced oxidative stress in mice after whiskers removal. Whiskers removal was shown to induce oxidative stress in tissues, so that protein carbonyl and TBARS formation were significantly increased as seen in other stress models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Plasma peroxynitrite levels were also significantly increased indicating plasma peroxinitrite production, which is one of the causative factors for the oxidative tissue injury in multiple organs. Since physical abuse might contribute less to this model than in other stress models, such as immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), electric shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and water-immersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), the oxidative stress observed here might be mainly due to the psychological or emotional stress induced by whiskers removal, which leads to certain distressed condition as was reflected in locomotive behavioral activity changes and plasma leucocytes profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Although the mechanisms of stress-induced oxidative damage are complex and remain unclear, for example, as to how stress causes oxidant production and oxidative damage via imbalances of hormones, neurotransmitters, oxidants and other stress mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), granulocyte activation is expected to be involved in the stress-induced oxidative injury of tissues. Under certain stress conditions including that of psychological stress, physical exercise and shear stress significantly alter immune functions, changes such as in subsets of peripheral blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). There, the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) increases a percentage of granulocytes in a shorter period than 6 h after stressor stimuli, and thus reactive oxygen species (ROS) both in the human body and the human derived cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In the present study, that a relative percent of granulocytes tended to increase while lymphocytes tended to decrease after whiskers removal, and thus G/L ratio became greater even though change in the tendency was not statistically defined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This might also be caused by GM-CSF induction through emotional stress and this leads to the overproduction of ROS to damage tissues.</p><p>Using this model, we examined the protective effects of TCM formulae on mental and emotional stress-induced oxidative stress. Currently, TCM has attracted attention as an alternative for the treatment of complex diseases that Western medicines are unable to treat. In TCM, multicomponent prescriptions are usually used for treating diseases. Therefore, complex interactions, such as additive, synergistic, restraint and antagonistic interactions are involved in the activities of the component herbs. These interactions are, however, considered essential in improving their therapeutic potentiality and in reducing the side effects of certain toxic ingredients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Thus, the underlying molecular mechanism is waiting to be clarified for routine usage of TCM. At the same time, an appropriate system needs to be developed to allow evaluation of the preventive and/or ameliorative potential of such complex formulae against sub-healthy pathological conditions.</p><p>The present study revealed that a simple whiskers removal model is applicable for this purpose. Two TCM formulae, SMS and LGZGT, markedly suppressed the stress-induced oxidative stress of the distressed mice. Previously, we showed that SMS has a stronger scavenging activity towards hydroxyl radicals rather than superoxide radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). LGZGT, on the other hand, scavenges superoxide radicals rather than hydroxyl radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In the present study, it was further revealed that both formulae inhibited peroxynitrite level increased under the whiskers removal stress as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>. Thus, the radical scavenging property might play a critical role in preventing effect of these formulae against oxidative stress. Since ginseng, one of the constituent herbs of SMS, is reported to have an anti-stress activity, such as the inhibition of enhanced lipid peroxidation in mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), it might also have played a major role in the protective action of SMS against the stressor studied here.</p><p>The modulation of physiological antioxidant systems by TCM is thought to be a more probable mechanism for the preventative ability of SMS on stressor-mediated oxidative stress, since we previously reported that SMS prevented the loss of GPX activity in the brain after ischemia reperfusion in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) in addition to its strong radical scavenging activity. This is also supported by our recent observation that SMS enhanced GPX activity expression in cultured myoblasts both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (paper in preparation). Similar modulation effects of SMS on antioxidant defense enzymes have been reported elsewhere, for example, hepatic glutathione (GSH) content increase in SMS-administered rats following CCl<sub>4</sub> intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and <italic>P. ginseng</italic>, one of the component herbs of SMS, enhanced SOD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) and activated the Cu/Zn-SOD gene at a transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). It is thus suggested that TCM formulae modulate the antioxidant potential of mice either by acting as an antioxidant and/or free radical scavenger, or by modulating physiological antioxidant defense mechanisms. Further investigations are underway to clarify the precise effect of TCM on the modulation of antioxidant defense mechanisms or other multiple pathways that modulate stress-mediated oxidative stress as a model of sub-healthy condition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported in part by a grant from the promotion and mutual aid corporation for private schools in Japan and also AOB in Japan.

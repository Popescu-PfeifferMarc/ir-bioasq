Assessment of joint cartilage degeneration and anti-inflammatory effects has also been examined in diverse animal models of arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies support existence of a synergistic relationship of these two agents associated with upregulation of matrix proteoglycan synthesis and downregulation of metalloprotease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) suggesting a &#x02018;chondroprotective&#x02019; effect. For the most part, these studies have only examined responses of articular chondrocytes but conceptually OA is considered a disorder of the entire articulating joint including the ligament and tendon accessory joint structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Ligaments and tendons are dense fibrous connective tissues providing mechanical stability to joints during movement. The cellular fibroblastic-like cells are surrounded by an organized fibrous extracellular matrix composed primarily of type I collagen, elastin, non-collagenous proteins (NCP), and small amounts of keratan and CS. Aging-related alterations or trauma to tendons and ligaments play a role in altering joint dynamics and predispose the joint to early onset of osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Tendon/ligament failure by traumatic rupture, overuse and/or inflammatory processes is ranked as the 15th most common musculoskeletal condition and 30&#x02013;50% of all sports injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Moreover, the annual incidence of acute rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament has been estimated to be one in 3000 in the American population, with &#x0223c;95&#x02009;000 new cases per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Current therapies for the treatment of ligament/tendon injuries emphasize non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) to minimize inflammation and subsequent damage to tissue integrity. However, caution has been recommended against excessive use of some NSAIDs since these agents have an inhibitory effect on proteoglycan synthesis and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and in animal models do not provide any biochemical benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). A number of growth promoting factors including platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta and basic fibroblast growth factor have demonstrated significant stimulation of matrix synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> but have not proved successful <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). There is currently no efficacious therapy for enhancing the rate and/or ability of these tissues to heal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Nutraceutical supplements including creatine, ephedra, etc., have been associated with side effects and lack rigorous quality assurance to warrant their use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Clinical trials using nutraceutical preparations for healing and minimizing inflammatory processes in dense connective tissues have not been performed. The significant advantage of such therapy for sports-related injuries is the possibility of enhancing natural repair processes and/or minimizing NSAIDs use.</p><p>The rationale for exploring whether the combination of glcN + CS has a beneficial effect on collagen synthesis in ligaments and tendons is based on previous studies suggesting that they act as biological response modifiers upregulating metabolic activity of chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Since the cells of ligament/tendon tissue have a similar origin as articular chondrocytes, exhibit similar aging-related changes in metabolism and mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), are less responsive to repair stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and are capable of maintaining normal remodeling processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), it was of interest to examine whether they respond in similar fashion as articular chondrocytes. Moreover, the majority of published studies with these agents have been on articular cartilage examining proteoglycan synthesis and degradation and anti-inflammatory activity. Little is known of their effect on collagen synthesis, a major component of cartilage as well as dense connective tissue. To this end, we took advantage of the availability of a commercial preparation, Cosamin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>DS (CDS; Nutramax Laboratories Inc., Edgewood, MD), a mixture of glucosamine HCl (FCHG49<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 99% purity), CS (TRH122<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 98% purity) and manganese ascorbate in the ratio 5:4:1 for which numerous clinical and <italic>in vitro</italic> data are available. The material was used as a combination rather than testing of individual components since previous data indicates that both agents exert an upregulation of synthetic activity of chondrocytes, but the combination of agents has greater efficacy clinically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) as well as acting synergistically on articular cartilage <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Articular cartilage was obtained from the articulating surfaces of metacarpal joints of 3- to 5-year-old Holstein cows. Ligament tissue was resected from between the 3rd and 4th metacarpal bones and a large segment of the extensor tendon was excised from an area adjacent to the metacarpal joint. All three minced tissues were digested with Type I (tendon and ligament) or Type II (cartilage) bacterial collagenase (Sigma/Aldrich Chemical Co., St Louis, MO) at 220 units ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The cell population was expanded by culturing in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks containing DMEM/F-12 + 10% fetal calf serum, 50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ascorbic acid 2-sulfate and antibiotics. In some studies, the epitenon was dissected from the tendon and cultured separately. After a single passage, sufficient cells were obtained for seeding into multiplate wells. All cultures were brought to a metabolic steady-state by culturing for an additional 5 days in DMEM/F-12 + 10% FCS. Twenty-four hours prior to testing, cell cultures were acclimated to DMEM/F-12 with 1% fetal calf serum, 50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ascorbic acid and 5 mM glucose. All subsequent studies were done with media containing physiological levels of glucose (5 mM) and varying doses of CDS. Two methods were utilized to monitor neosynthesis of collagen and NCP.</p><sec><title>Method 1: Incorporation of Tritiated Proline (pro) into Collagenase-Sensitive Material</title><p>Cells cultured in 24-well plates at a high density of 200&#x02009;000 cells per well were exposed at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h to CDS at doses of 1, 10, 50 and 100 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 5 &#x003bc;Ci ml<sup>&#x02212;1 3</sup>H-proline (specific activity 97 Ci mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). There were eight replicates/treatments in a total media volume of 0.5 ml. IGF-1 at 50 ng ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was used as a positive control. Cultures were terminated by freeze-thawing and sonication to rupture cells. Soluble collagen and NCP synthesis were assayed following the addition of 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to precipitate all proteins contained in the combined cell layer and media (final TCA concentration 5%). The plates were centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. in microplate carriers for 15 min and the supernatant removed. TCA (5% containing 1 mM proline) precipitation was repeated until the supernate was free of unincorporated radiolabel. Residual TCA was removed by a final rinse of ethanol:ethyl ether (1:1) and the culture plates air dried.</p><p>Assay of collagenase-sensitive material was done according to the method of Diegelmann <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) Briefly, collagen in the TCA precipitated air-dried plates was digested by adding an incubation cocktail containing 25 &#x003bc;g purified collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) in 200 &#x003bc;l of 0.05 M Tris (pH 7.6) containing 0.005 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The plates were incubated for 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was removed after centrifugation and the collagenase digestion repeated a second time. Radioactivity in the pooled supernates (total collagen fraction) was counted in multiplate wells after addition of 300 &#x003bc;l of scintillant (Hewlett Packard) to 100 &#x003bc;l of sample. The residue (NCP) was dissolved by heating at 50&#x000b0;C in 1 N NaOH for 15 min and similar aliquots were counted as described above. The data are expressed as CPM &#x000b1; SEM associated with collagenase-sensitive material and NCP.

The supernate from the collagenase digestion (total collagen fraction) was made up to 6 N HCl with concentrated acid and hydrolyzed at 120&#x000b0;C under vacuum for 24 h. After evaporation of the HCl, the amino acid residue was dansylated by adding 100 &#x003bc;l of 500 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 100 &#x003bc;l of 20 mM Dns-Cl in acetone to 100 &#x003bc;l of hydrolyzed sample.

The addition of 1% fetal calf serum was considered to be the minimal amount necessary for maintenance and adherence of the cells in culture.</p><p>Epitenon cells are considered to be the collagen-producing cells involved in healing of tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), but <italic>in vivo</italic> ligaments are considered to be functionally and metabolically the more active tissue compared to tendons or chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Our data confirms these findings insofar as ligament cells incorporated almost twice the radioactivity into collagenase-sensitive material than tenocytes or chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This was also seen in calculation of the specific activity of hyp (+132% in ligament versus +27% in tenocytes). Interestingly, when comparing the ratio of radiolabeled proline in collagen versus radiolabeled proline in NCP, a 3-fold increase was seen with IGF-1 in chondrocytes and tenocytes but not ligament cells. Moreover, the ratio in cells exposure to CDS did not significantly differ from controls. This suggests that the response of chondrocytes and tenocytes to CDS may differ mechanistically from that of IGF-1.</p><p>Few publications have been devoted to the effect of glcN or CS on collagen synthesis. Bassleer <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) found that CS had no effect on human cartilage collagen synthesis and Anderson <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) failed to detect an effect of glucosamine on canine chondrocyte collagen synthesis. However, the data of Jimenez <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and O'Grady <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) indicate increased gene expression for collagen synthesis with both agents as well as with a combination of agents. The disparity in results may be a reflection of the doses used, the culture system, i.e. cells clusters versus explants or may indicate that the increase in mRNA levels is not reflected in the actual assayable final product.</p><p>The inhibitory effect of high levels of CS on glycosaminoglycan synthesis by chondrocytes has been observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Although our preparation consisted of a mixture of glcN and CS, the inhibition of collagen synthesis observed at doses higher than 50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (20 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> CS) suggest that the effect is due to the CS component. An explanation for the inverse dose&#x02013;response of connective tissue cells to CS was not investigated in this study nor has any explanation been forthcoming by other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). It may be a reasonable conjecture that the response resembles a typical non-monotonic dose&#x02013;response (i.e. a non-linear curve where the slope of the dose&#x02013;response reverses sign somewhere along the curve).</p><p>There are several complementary and alternative therapies related to connective tissue metabolism and repair. For example, a recent review by Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) describes the use of botanicals in osteoarthritis. Bromelain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and bee venom acupuncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) have also been proposed for a similar application. The addition of glucosamine and CS to the list of alternative therapies provides an additional tool to alternative non-invasive treatment.</p><p>The clinical significance of these data relates to documentation that patients with meniscus and ligament injuries of the knee have a high incidence of developing degenerative radiological changes within a 10&#x02013;20 year period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Since collagen is the major component of these tissues, our hypothesis is that upregulation of its synthesis by a combination of glcN and CS may accelerate tissue repair and diminish the probability of OA development. However, it is too premature to extrapolate our <italic>in vitro</italic> data to <italic>in vivo</italic> circumstances by stating that these agents accelerate ligament and tendon healing. However, under conditions of trauma/stress where collagen degradation is occurring the combination of glcN and CS may circumvent and/or accelerate repair processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). It should also be noted that these results pertain to <italic>in vitro</italic> direct effects of the agents on connective tissue cell metabolism. Clinical efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> relates to symptomatic relief by virtue of their anti-inflammatory action and therefore does not necessarily equate to the observed metabolic responses.

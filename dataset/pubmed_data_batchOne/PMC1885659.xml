The operator DNA sequence to which C.AhdI binds consists of two adjacent binding sites, O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>R</sub>. Binding of C.AhdI to O<sub>L</sub> and to O<sub>L</sub>&#x02009;<bold>+</bold>&#x02009;O<sub>R</sub> has been investigated by circular permutation DNA-bending assays and by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. CD indicates considerable distortion to the DNA when bound by C.AhdI. Binding to one or two sites to form dimeric and tetrameric complexes increases the CD signal at 278&#x02009;nm by 40 and 80% respectively, showing identical local distortion at both sites. In contrast, DNA-bending assays gave similar bend angles for both dimeric and tetrameric complexes (47 and 38&#x000b0;, respectively). The relative orientation of C.AhdI dimers in the tetrameric complex and the structural role of the conserved Py-A-T sequences found at the centre of C-protein-binding sites are discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Restriction&#x02013;modification (R&#x02013;M) systems encode a DNA methyltransferase and an endonuclease. The methyltransferase (MTase) methylates specific bases within the DNA recognition sequence; the restriction endonuclease (ENase) cleaves DNA that is unmethylated at these sites, whilst host DNA is methylated and avoids restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). This defence mechanism prevents incorporation of foreign DNA into the host and thus acts as a primitive form of &#x02018;immune system&#x02019;.</p><p>To avoid the possibility of ENase activity occurring prior to methylation of the host DNA, the system must be temporally regulated and ENase expression delayed until such time as the MTase has modified all potential host target sites. It is found that many R&#x02013;M systems contain an additional gene coding for a small protein (the controller, or C, protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">2&#x02013;12</xref>) that regulates ENase expression (and may also, in some cases, modulate expression of the MTase).</p><p>The C-proteins bind to a control sequence upstream of the C-gene, which, in turn, is located upstream of the ENase (R) gene, such that the C and R genes are transcribed as one operon. High levels of transcription from the PvuII C/R promoter require C-protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and C-dependent transcriptional regulation has been reported for other R&#x02013;M systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In addition, a weak C-independent promoter has been reported in PvuII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), which would allow subsequent transcription from the C-dependent promoter. In AhdI, both C-dependent and C-independent transcription have also been demonstrated (K. Severinov, personal communication).</p><p>The high-resolution structure of C.AhdI from the R&#x02013;M system of <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> was the first to be reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The structure reveals a largely alpha-helical dimeric protein, including a helix-turn-helix motif responsible for DNA sequence recognition. Efficient binding to DNA requires dimerization of C.AhdI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, since the interaction between the two subunits of the dimer is weak (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;M), expression of C.AhdI (and thus R.AhdI) from this promoter cannot be established until sufficiently high concentrations of C.AhdI have accumulated (via expression from the weak C-independent promoter) to favour protein dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). C.AhdI dimers then bind to the C/R operator and activate transcription from the strong C-dependent promoter, leading to an exponential increase in C-protein (and thus the endonuclease) by positive feedback. It is clear that a mechanism for switching off transcription is also required in any such positive feedback system.</p><p>We have previously shown that the controller protein C.AhdI binds cooperatively to a sequence about 30&#x02009;bp upstream of its own gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This sequence contains a quasi-symmetrical repeating sequence resembling that found upstream of many C-genes in a variety of type II R&#x02013;M systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). EMSA and analytical ultracentrifugation studies have shown that C.AhdI forms dimeric and tetrameric complexes on the promoter, and the binding constants for these interactions have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). It was proposed that the binding of C.AhdI dimers at the distal site (O<sub>L</sub>) upstream of the C-gene activates transcription of the C and R genes, through interaction with the &#x003c3;-70 subunit of RNA polymerase bound at the adjacent &#x02212;35 site, whereas subsequent binding of the C-protein to the proximal (O<sub>R</sub>) site (overlapping the &#x02212;35 site) to form tetramers represses transcription from this operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Binding of C.AhdI to the proximal site may provide the required mechanism for subsequently switching off transcription of its own gene, and thus also down-regulating R.AhdI, to avoid overproduction of the endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>There is no experimentally derived structure available for the C.AhdI&#x02013;promoter complex, although models have been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The 15-bp spacing between the two binding sites would suggest that the dimers may be bound to opposite faces of the DNA helix. However, both bending and twisting of DNA can be important features in protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Any large conformational changes (bending or twisting) induced in the DNA would significantly affect the relative orientation of dimers and thus their intermolecular contacts in the DNA&#x02013;protein complex.</p><p>Here, we report the results of DNA-bending assays and circular dichroism (CD) experiments to identify possible changes in the conformation of the DNA upon formation of dimeric and tetrameric nucleoprotein complexes. Since binding to both operator sites in the native promoter is highly cooperative, it is difficult to find experimental conditions where only a single dimer is bound to the DNA. Consequently, as well as the natural sequence containing both binding sites (35WT), for each experiment we have also used a mutated version of the natural 35&#x02009;bp operator in which one operator sequence (O<sub>R</sub>) is changed to a non-specific sequence, since this DNA sequence (35L) does not readily form tetrameric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of C.AhdI</title><p>C.AhdI was expressed and purified according to the methods previously described by Streeter <italic>et al</italic>.

C.AhdI was then precipitated by addition of 30% w/v (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, resuspended, dialysed and purified on a heparin column. C.AhdI was then further purified by isoelectric precipitation, followed by cation exchange chromatography using an SP Sepharose column and size exclusion chromatography. Where required, the protein was concentrated by an additional SP Sepharose step using a salt step gradient. Purity at each step was determined by Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. The concentration of the protein was determined by UV absorption at 276&#x02009;nm, using the theoretical extinction coefficient of 2900&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of DNA samples</title><p>DNA-binding studies required the use of pure DNA duplexes of accurately measured concentration.

Successful insertion of the binding sites was verified by EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII digestion of the resulting plasmids, where insertion of the binding site increases the fragment size from 242 to 277&#x02009;bp. DNA sequencing subsequently confirmed the successful insertion of the fragments and identified their orientation.

The instrument was calibrated for ellipticity units (in millidegrees) and wavelength (in nm) using camphor sulphonic acid at 290.5&#x02009;nm and the xenon fine structure in the region 460&#x02013;490&#x02009;nm, respectively. Due to the solvent conditions (40&#x02009;mM Na citrate pH5.6, 100&#x02009;mM NaCl, 1&#x02009;mM EDTA), the wavelength scans were limited to 360&#x02013;230&#x02009;nm in all cases with the slits set to 2&#x02009;nm on the monochromator.

In addition, each sample was scanned four times and the resultant data was signal averaged. Smoothing was not required for this data set as the signal to noise was excellent.

An aliquot of 1&#x02009;ml of DNA was pipetted into a Hellma 119.004F-QS strain-free cuvette for both 35WT and 35L experiments. Aliquots of protein (50&#x02009;&#x003bc;M C.AhdI) were then added and CD spectra (360&#x02013;230&#x02009;nm) recorded on each addition and corrected for dilution.

A number of vectors have been constructed to allow determination of the degree of protein-induced DNA bending from EMSA experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The bending vector, pBend5, contains a 242&#x02009;bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment that consists of duplicated restriction sites, separated by single XbaI, HpaI and SalI sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). A DNA-binding sequence can be cloned into the middle of this fragment, with one series of restriction sites on either side. Digestion of the resulting plasmid with any of these restriction enzymes results in fragments of equal size, but with the DNA-binding site situated at different positions, either in the middle of the fragment or towards its ends. If the DNA is bent when the protein binds, the fragment with the binding site located near the end should be the least retarded.</p><p>In order to investigate binding of a C.AhdI dimer and a C.AhdI tetramer to the left (O<sub>L</sub>) and complete (O<sub>L</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;O<sub>R</sub>) operators, respectively, a bending assay was performed using two DNA-binding sequences: the 35L sequence consisting of the native O<sub>L</sub> sequence but with the O<sub>R</sub> sequence mutated and the native 35WT sequence, in which both O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>R</sub> are intact. We have previously shown that 35L binds a single dimer of C.AhdI, whereas 35WT binds two C.AhdI dimers in a highly cooperative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Thus DNA bending by dimeric and tetrameric complexes can be compared.</p><p>Gel retardation analysis of the fragments containing the complete C.AhdI operator sequence reveals clear retardation of the fragment containing 35WT positioned in the centre, the extent of retardation decreasing symmetrically as the binding site is positioned nearer the ends of the fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The mobilities of each of the DNA fragments in the absence of protein were similar, indicating that there is no intrinsic bending of the DNA prior to protein&#x02013;DNA complex formation.

As with 35WT, 35L also demonstrated minimum mobility when in the middle of the EcoRV-digested fragment. However, the mobility of the bands was not entirely symmetrical for the two apparently equivalent fragments. The equivalent MluI and BamHI fragments in which the left operator is located at opposing ends of the DNA fragment had different mobilities, with the BamHI fragment being more retarded than that of MluI. This is caused by the displacement of O<sub>L</sub> from the centre of the 35L insertion. Thus, the centre of the protein-binding site is some 17&#x02009;bp closer to the end of the MluI fragment than in the BamHI fragment, resulting in a greater mobility in the former case.

Upon addition of C.AhdI to 35WT, an almost linear increase in &#x00394;&#x003b5; was observed up to a 4:1 protein to DNA molar ratio, indicating strong stoichiometric binding to both DNA-binding sites. The &#x00394;&#x003b5; observed for C.AhdI binding to 35L increases in a similar fashion up to a 2:1 protein to DNA ratio, and thereafter increases at a much lower rate, consistent with strong binding of the first dimer and very weak binding of the second dimer. The pronounced increase in the CD signal for binding C.AhdI dimers and tetramers (40 and 80%, respectively) clearly indicates a significant deformation to the DNA structure at each of the two adjacent DNA-binding sites.

The free DNA shows a classical melting curve with a <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 65.2&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). It is notable that for the 2:1 and 4:1 nucleoprotein complexes, the large enhancement of the CD signal remains throughout the temperature range until the DNA melts. Thus the C.AhdI dimeric and tetrameric complexes are highly thermostable; moreover, the structural changes induced in the DNA are retained until the DNA denatures. Normalization of the data to represent the fractional denaturation of the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B) shows that the melting curves are almost identical. Detailed inspection of the curves shows that there is a small increase in the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> from 65.2 to 66.5&#x000b0;C for the tetrameric complex and a somewhat higher <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 68.5&#x000b0;C for the dimeric complex. The slightly lower thermal stability of the tetrameric complex, compared to the dimeric complex, could reflect the higher intrinsic binding affinity at the O<sub>L</sub> site, combined with a decrease in the cooperativity (and thus a reduction in the effective affinity for the second site) at higher temperatures.

Specifically, binding of a C.AhdI dimer to the O<sub>L</sub> site induces a 40% increase in the CD signal of the peak at 278&#x02009;nm and binding of two such dimers to the intact operator site induces an 80% increase in the CD signal, when compared to the CD spectra of the free DNA. The structural changes observed for the binding of consecutive C.AhdI dimers to the operator sequence are additive, in contrast to the situation observed in bending assays. This reflects the fact that CD is reporting on local structure rather than the global structure responsible for electrophoretic mobility.</p><p>Hillen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) carried out a systematic study of the CD spectra of DNA fragments of various sequences in the range 12&#x02013;360&#x02009;bp and, although the detailed spectra differ in detail, all had values of &#x00394;&#x003b5; of around 2.5 (cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) per nucleotide, typical of B-form DNA. A-form DNA (for example, when induced by non-aqueous solvents) typically shows much higher values of &#x00394;&#x003b5;.</p><p>The CD spectrum of DNA can also change significantly when bound by proteins that distort the DNA structure locally. The magnitude of the positive CD peak most often increases when DNA&#x02013;protein complexes are formed, for example as seen for <italic>gal</italic> repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and <italic>lac</italic> repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>); however, in some instances e.g. <italic>cro</italic> repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), the CD signal decreases on forming the DNA&#x02013;protein complex. The observed increase in &#x00394;&#x003b5; in the C.AhdI tetrameric complex (from 2.9 to 5.2&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per nucleotide) is amongst the largest observed, comparable but even larger than the increase in CD when two TET repressor dimers bind to the <italic>tet</italic> operator sequence (from 2.9 to 4.8&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>)). It is interesting to note that the bend angle (48&#x000b0;) introduced into DNA when a TET repressor dimer binds to its operator sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) is almost identical to the bend angle (47&#x000b0;) when a C.AhdI dimer binds DNA, correlating with a similar increase in CD signal at 276&#x02009;nm.</p><p>The optimal DNA length required for dimer and tetramer binding was previously measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to be &#x0223c;21 and &#x0223c;35&#x02009;bp, respectively, indicating significant (&#x0223c;7&#x02009;bp) overlap between the two C.AhdI dimers in the tetramer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). It was therefore proposed that the two dimers must occupy different faces of the DNA helix. This would be consistent with the observed spacing of 15&#x02009;bp between the centres of the two binding sites, if standard B-form DNA was assumed. However, formation of DNA&#x02013;protein complexes frequently distort the DNA and indeed, this is the case for C.AhdI as judged by the results of circular dichroism.</p><p>Using mobility shift assays, we have shown that binding of a C.AhdI dimer to O<sub>L</sub> causes the DNA to bend by &#x0223c;47&#x000b0;, while binding of two dimers to the complete operator sequence containing both O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>R</sub> induces a bend of &#x0223c;38&#x000b0;. Assuming the local bend at each site is equal, one can relate the overall bend angle to the rotational phasing of the two dimers in the tetrameric complex. If the two C.AhdI dimers bound on the same face of the DNA (&#x003d5;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0), the bend angle for the tetramer complex would be double that for the dimer complex. However, we find that the bending is not additive; rather, formation of the tetramer leads to a lower overall bend angle than that caused by binding of one dimer, supporting the hypothesis that the two dimers occupy different faces of the DNA. Clearly, however, the bend angles do not cancel out to zero (as might be expected if the proteins were bound on opposite faces of the DNA helix, i.e. &#x003d5;&#x02009;=&#x02009;180&#x000b0;).</p><p>It is possible to estimate the twist angle (&#x003d5;) between the planes of adjacent bending centres trigonometrically from the overall bend angles observed for dimeric and tetrameric complexes. For two identical bends (&#x003b1;) introduced into a linear structure, where the planes defining each bend deviate from co-planarity by an angle &#x003d5;, giving an overall bend angle &#x003b3;, it can be shown (Dr D. Whitley, personal communication) that cos &#x003b3;&#x02009;=&#x02009;sqrt(1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;<italic>s</italic><sup>2</sup>) cos (&#x003b1;&#x02009;+&#x02009;&#x003b4;), where <italic>s</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;(sin &#x003b1;&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;sin &#x003d5;), &#x003b4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;tan<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (tan &#x003b1;&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;cos &#x003d5;). This analysis assumes that the distance separating the two bends is small compared with the overall length, as is the case here. From this we derive a twist angle, &#x003d5;&#x02009;=&#x02009;125&#x000b0; corresponding to 11.1&#x02009;bp per turn over the 15&#x02009;bp separating the two centres (or the equally valid mirror image solution, &#x003d5;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;125&#x000b0;&#x02009;=&#x02009;235&#x000b0;, corresponding to 9.1&#x02009;bp per turn). This can be compared with theoretical values of &#x003d5;&#x02009;=&#x02009;180&#x000b0; for 10&#x02009;bp per turn, or 155&#x000b0; for 10.5&#x02009;bp per turn. Thus our data indicate that in addition to DNA bending, there is significant twisting of the DNA, but we cannot distinguish between the two possibilities of underwinding or overwinding.</p><p>Dickerson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) has performed a systematic study of DNA bending by proteins, and found that such bending is almost always due to the roll angle at adjacent Py-Pu steps, notably at CA and TA dinucleotides. It is of interest to note that the trinucleotide spacer at the centre of both C.AhdI-binding sites (CAT and TAT, respectively) is strongly conserved over a wide range of known and predicted C-protein-binding sites from different bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). This suggests a structural role since these sequences are asymmetrical and unlikely to make sequence-specific interactions with the C-protein dimer. It may also be relevant that the most commonly found nucleotide following the T of the trinucleotide spacer is A (i.e. the first base in the consensus recognition sequence AGTC). The conservation of Py-A-T sequences in the trinucleotide spacer could therefore reflect a requirement for protein-induced DNA bending at these sites.</p><p>Finally, the results presented should be of more general significance in cases where two or more proteins bend adjacent sequences of DNA. We show that the overall bend angle observed is unlikely to be simply the sum of the individual bend angles, but will be highly dependent on the rotational phasing of the binding sites and thus the twist angle of the intervening base pairs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank D.Whitley for his help in deriving the trigonometrical formula for combining bending angles.

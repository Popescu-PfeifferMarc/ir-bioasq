In an effort to determine the minimal region of 7SK needed to interact with HEXIM1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we found that an oligo comprised of nucleotides 10&#x02013;48 sufficed. A bid to further narrow down the minimal region of 7SK led to a surprising finding that HEXIM1 binds to double-stranded RNA in a sequence-independent manner. Both dsRNA and 7SK (10&#x02013;48), but not dsDNA, competed efficiently with full-length 7SK for HEXIM1 binding <italic>in vitro</italic>. Upon binding dsRNA, a large conformational change was observed in HEXIM1 that allowed the recruitment and inhibition of P-TEFb. Both subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence demonstrated that, while most HEXIM1 is found in the nucleus, a significant fraction is found in the cytoplasm. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both nuclear and cytoplasmic HEXIM1 is associated with RNA. Interestingly, the one microRNA examined (mir-16) was found in HEXIM1 immunoprecipitates, while the small nuclear RNAs, U6 and U2, were not. Our study illuminates novel properties of HEXIM1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and suggests that HEXIM1 may be involved in other nuclear and cytoplasmic processes besides controlling P-TEFb.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>P-TEFb plays a key role in RNA polymerase II elongation control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). It is comprised of one of two isoforms of Cdk9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and one of three cyclins, T1, T2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) or K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) in humans. One of the major targets of the kinase activity of P-TEFb is the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and this phosphorylation of the CTD by P-TEFb occurs during transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). P-TEFb also phosphorylates the negative transcription elongation factor DSIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), turning it into a positive elongation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). P-TEFb controls gene expression by regulating the fraction of RNA polymerase II molecules that generate full-length mRNAs. In addition to its normal cellular role, P-TEFb has been shown to be recruited by viral transactivator Tat to the nascent viral transcript, TAR, near the promoter to enhance viral transcription, which is required for efficient HIV-1 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15 B16">12&#x02013;16</xref>).</p><p>P-TEFb is uniquely regulated by the reversible association of a small nuclear RNA, 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and one of two HEXIM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22">19&#x02013;22</xref>). Glycerol gradient analyses of cell lysates indicate that two forms of P-TEFb exist in the cell. An active form of P-TEFb, free of HEXIM and 7SK, interacts with a variety of cellular factors, including NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and Brd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), to regulate gene transcription. A larger, inactive form contains 7SK and HEXIM proteins that together sequester active P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). When cells are treated with P-TEFb inhibitors, such as DRB, or other agents that block transcription, P-TEFb is quickly released from the large form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This form of P-TEFb regulation is physiologically significant, because it has been shown that all signals that trigger cardiac hypertrophy converge at the critical step of activating P-TEFb through the dissociation of 7SK and HEXIM. This activation causes increased cellular transcription and an increase in the size of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30 B31">28&#x02013;31</xref>). Factors that release P-TEFb from the 7SK&#x02022;HEXIM1&#x02022;P-TEFb complex are currently unknown.</p><p>Several studies have uncovered some of the important interactions in the 7SK&#x02022;HEXIM1&#x02022;P-TEFb complex. Functional domains of HEXIM1 have been identified. The N-terminal region of HEXIM1 (amino acids 1&#x02013;120) is found to be self-inhibitory, preventing HEXIM1 from interacting with P-TEFb in the absence of 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The region centered upon KHRR (amino acids 152&#x02013;155) is involved in the binding of 7SK, and nearby sequences comprise nuclear localization signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). An adjacent region centered upon PYNT (amino acids 202&#x02013;205) is involved in interaction with P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), and a small region centered upon Y271 is involved in inhibition of P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The C-terminal region of HEXIM1 (amino acids 281&#x02013;359) mediates the dimerization of HEXIM1 via a leucine zipper motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In addition, the regions involved in interactions have been narrowed down to amino acids 1&#x02013;254 of 726 of cyclin T1, all of Cdk9 and nucleotide 1&#x02013;172 of 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the T-loop of Cdk9 has been implicated in the activation of P-TEFb and is required for the formation of the 7SK&#x02022;HEXIM1&#x02022;P-TEFb complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>In attempts to narrow down the minimal sequence of 7SK that is needed to form the 7SK&#x02022;HEXIM1&#x02022;P-TEFb complex <italic>in vitro</italic>, we serendipitously discovered that HEXIM1 is a potent dsRNA-binding protein. Further analysis revealed that dsRNA induces a conformational change in HEXIM1, so that it can interact with P-TEFb. In addition, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies demonstrated that endogenous HEXIM1 can be found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and most HEXIM1 in cells is associated with a variety of RNAs. Interestingly, at least one microRNA was found to be associated with HEXIM1. These findings provide a mechanistic insight into the inhibition of P-TEFb by HEXIM1 and RNA, suggest a possible mechanism on how cells balance active and inactive forms of P-TEFb and indicate that HEXIM1 may play other roles besides inhibiting P-TEFb <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>EMSA</title><p>Here, 12&#x02009;&#x000b5;l reactions were carried out in 25&#x02009;mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 15% glycerol, 60&#x02009;mM KCl, 0.1&#x02009;mM EDTA, 5&#x02009;mM DTT, 0.01% NP-40 and included 200&#x02009;ng recombinant HEXIM1, recombinant P-TEFb and various RNA or DNA oligos as indicated.

Because HIV Tat protein and HEXIM1 have a nearly identical RNA-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), we looked for regions of 7SK that might mimic the Tat-binding site (TAR) in the HIV 5&#x02032; UTR. Tat binds a bulged region of TAR RNA containing the sequence AUCUG. Considering that AUCUG should appear randomly only once in every 1024&#x02009;nt, we were surprised to find that 7SK (330&#x02009;nt) contained three AUCUG motifs in the first 70&#x02009;nt. The first two reside in nucleotides 10&#x02013;48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). In addition, mFold analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) suggested that the structure of the first AUCUG in the context of nucleotides 10&#x02013;48 resembled that predicted to occur in TAR (data not shown). These observations prompted us to test if 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31 B32 B33 B34 B35 B36 B37 B38 B39 B40 B41 B42 B43 B44">10&#x02013;48</xref>) was able to bind HEXIM1 using a modified electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In this assay, recombinant HEXIM1 was examined on a native gel and visualized by silver staining. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, wild-type HEXIM1 (WT) migrated as a discrete band as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) for a dimer of HEXIM1. When increasing amounts of the 7SK oligo were added, HEXIM1 shifted up the gel to a new discrete position. The shift was complete when 10&#x02009;pmol of the oligo were added. Moreover, no further significant shift occurred in the presence of excess oligo up to 100&#x02009;pmol. Because the reactions contained 5&#x02009;pmol of HEXIM1 and a little more than 50% of the HEXIM1 was shifted by 3&#x02009;pmol of the 7SK oligo, it is likely that, similar to what was found earlier with 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), a one-to-one complex of RNA to HEXIM1 dimer formed. As a control, HEXIM1 containing a substitution of ILAA for KHRR (amino acids 152&#x02013;155) that does not bind to 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) was analyzed. Addition of the 7SK oligo did not result in any specific shift of the mutant HEXIM1. These results indicate that the 39-nt oligo binds to HEXIM1 and that this binding requires the same region of HEXIM1 needed for binding to 7SK.

These oligos contain either individual AUCUG regions or other regions of 7SK as negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). The ability of these oligos to bind HEXIM1 was analyzed in EMSA (raw data not shown). To our surprise, none of these oligos changed the mobility of HEXIM1, except for one of the negative controls, 7SK (303&#x02013;319), which does not have the AUCUG sequence. It showed only a weak interaction. mFold analyses of these five oligos revealed that there was a correlation not with the presence of AUCUG, but rather the stability of potential double-stranded stem structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). This observation prompted us to ask if HEXIM1 actually binds to a double-stranded structure. First, we tested a set of siRNA oligos used to knock down cellular genes. They had double-stranded regions of either 19 or 25&#x02009;bp with two deoxynucleotide overhangs at one or both 3&#x02032; ends and did not share any sequence similarities with each other or 7SK. Remarkably, all of them were able to shift HEXIM1 as well as the 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31 B32 B33 B34 B35 B36 B37 B38 B39 B40 B41 B42 B43 B44">10&#x02013;48</xref>) oligo (data not shown). Again, all of them failed to shift the ILAA HEXIM1 mutant, a 7SK-binding-deficient HEXIM1 mutant (data not shown). These data suggested that HEXIM1 could associate with dsRNA, regardless of its sequence.</p><p>To eliminate the possibility that HEXIM1 required the deoxynucleotide overhangs present in those siRNA constructs, two 25-base single-stranded DNA oligos, D1 and D2, and two single-stranded RNA oligos, R1 and R2, were designed. D1 has the same sequence as R1 and is complementary to D2. Thus, we could form one dsDNA (D1/D2), one dsRNA (R1/R2) and two DNA/RNA hybrids (D1/R2 and D2/R1). When single-stranded oligos (D1, D2, R1 and R2) were used, none of them were able to shift HEXIM1 mobility significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). R1 was able to partially shift HEXIM1&#x02009;at the highest concentration because it could form a semi-stable double-stranded structure (data not shown). In sharp contrast, when double-stranded oligos were used, all of them were able to shift HEXIM1. The only difference detected in this assay was that the dsDNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 complex migrated differently from the dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 and DNA/RNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The difference in mobility between dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 and dsDNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 will be addressed later.

WT and ILAA HEXIM1 (2&#x02009;pmol) were incubated with increasing amounts of either R2 (ssRNA) or R1/R2 (dsRNA). HEXIM1 was visualized by silver staining. As expected, dsRNA lowered the mobility of WT HEXIM1 but not that of the ILAA RNA-binding mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, top panel). Note that the HEXIM1 shift was less dramatic than that seen earlier because the native gel was stopped very early to keep the small RNAs from running off the gel. ssRNA failed to slow the mobility of either WT or ILAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, top panel). Autoradiography of the region of the gel containing the HEXIM1 proteins demonstrated that only dsRNA was associated with HEXIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, middle panel).

Previously, we reported that the 7SK&#x02022;HEXIM1 complex is relatively stable because <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 7SK in a pre-formed 7SK&#x02022;HEXIM1 complex could not be competed off by the addition of cold 7SK even at 100-fold excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Because of this, an experiment was designed to look at competition for HEXIM1 binding under two conditions. DNA and RNA were mixed together before HEXIM1 was added to look at competition during binding, or DNA or RNA were added separately to allow prebinding to HEXIM1 before the other was added. When the binding reaction contained 0.5&#x02009;pmol of dsRNA and increasing amounts of dsDNA were added to HEXIM1&#x02009;at the same time, only dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, dsDNA During). To examine the stability of the dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 complex, we preformed this complex and then added increasing amount of dsDNA. Even a 10-fold excess of dsDNA was unable to affect the dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, dsDNA After). This protocol was repeated using a constant amount of dsDNA and increasing amounts of dsRNA. Again, dsRNA was able to efficiently compete with dsDNA binding to HEXIM1, even if the dsDNA complex was preformed before dsRNA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Taking into consideration the concentration of the various nucleic acids used, dsRNA, 7SK (10&#x02013;48) and 7SK had roughly equal affinity for HEXIM1, while dsDNA had &#x0223c;1% of that affinity.</p></sec><sec><title>dsRNA binding induces changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of HEXIM1</title><p>The shift to lower mobility upon binding of 25-bp dsRNA (16&#x02009;kDa) to HEXIM1 (80&#x02009;kDa dimer) was somewhat unexpected, especially considering that the overall negative charge of the dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 complex was increased significantly, which would tend to increase its mobility. We reasoned that the binding of dsRNA might induce a conformational change in HEXIM1, leading to a decrease in mobility due to its more expanded shape. In an attempt to obtain further evidence for a conformational change in HEXIM1 induced by dsRNA, intrinsic fluorescence from tryptophan residues was measured. Using 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M HEXIM1 in a buffer identical to that used in the EMSA, the optimal excitation wavelength was found to be 276, nm and this provided a strong peak in emission at 350.7&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). An equimolar amount of dsDNA or dsRNA in the same buffer had negligible emission (data not shown). When 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M of dsDNA was added to the HEXIM1 solution, a 10% reduction in the emission signal was detected, and the peak in emission remained at essentially the same wavelength (350.8&#x02009;nm). In contrast, the addition of 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M dsRNA decreased the emission signal to 50%, and shifted the peak in emission to 352.0&#x02009;nm. Differences in the normalized spectra confirmed that dsRNA, but not DNA, caused a shift in the &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> as evidenced by the inversion in sign of the difference at around 350&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). We do not know why RNA additionally caused a peak at 299&#x02009;nm in the difference spectrum, but DNA did not cause any change. Both the large decrease in intrinsic fluorescence, the observed changes in the difference spectrum and a shift of the emission peak are consistent with an RNA-induced change in conformation, in which one or more of the four tryptophan residues moves from a relatively hydrophobic to a more hydrophilic environment.

P-TEFb containing full-length Cdk9 and truncated cyclin T1 with amino acids 1&#x02013;290 was expressed in a baculovirus system and purified. The final product had no detectable contaminants even when examined on an overloaded, silver-stained SDS gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). When HEXIM1 and P-TEFb were mixed together and examined by EMSA, there was no detectable intermediate band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), indicating HEXIM1 does not directly interact with P-TEFb. This is in agreement with previous findings that HEXIM1 does not interact with P-TEFb without 7SK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). However, when dsRNA was added, free P-TEFb disappeared, while a new band formed above the dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 band, demonstrating that P-TEFb was recruited to form a dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1&#x02022;P-TEFb complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Similar results were obtained with P-TEFb containing full-length cyclin T1 (data not shown). A kinase assay was then used to examine the effect of dsRNA on P-TEFb activity. As expected, HEXIM1, 7SK, dsRNA and dsDNA by themselves did not alter the kinase activity of P-TEFb. Both the 7SK&#x02022;HEXIM1 and dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 complexes dramatically inhibited the kinase activity of P-TEFb, which is unchanged in the presence of the dsDNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). This is in agreement with earlier results showing that both 7SK and dsRNA but not dsDNA can induce a conformational change in HEXIM1, resulting in the recruitment of P-TEFb.

HeLa cells were lysed in the presence of a non-ionic detergent, and the lysate analyzed by glycerol gradient sedimentation. In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), most endogenous HEXIM1 sedimented in fractions free of P-TEFb and 7SK (fractions 2&#x02013;6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), and only a small fraction of total HEXIM1 co-migrated with P-TEFb and 7SK (fractions 8&#x02013;11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A).

While most HEXIM1 in fraction 2 migrated like the recombinant HEXIM1, almost all HEXIM1 proteins in the rest of the fractions examined had reduced mobility, indicating that there were other components associated with HEXIM1. Remarkably, when individual fractions were treated with RNase A first and then examined in the same way, all HEXIM1 signals were compressed into a single band that migrated like recombinant HEXIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B).

This raised the possibility that HEXIM1&#x02022;RNA complexes observed above might be an artifact of nuclear HEXIM1 interacting with cytoplasmic RNAs. To examine this possibility, cells were lysed by homogenization in the absence of detergent, followed by differential centrifugation to separate nuclei from the cytoplasm. The nuclei were then extracted in the presence of a non-ionic detergent. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, most if not all Cdk9 was retained in the nucleus, demonstrating successful separation of the cytoplasm from the nucleus. Surprisingly, a considerable amount of HEXIM1 was present in the cytoplasmic fraction. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic HEXIM1 proteins were then examined by native gel electrophoresis. While a small fraction of nuclear HEXIM1 migrated the same as recombinant HEXIM1, most nuclear HEXIM1 had reduced mobility compared to free HEXIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Also, most, if not all, cytoplasmic HEXIM1 had reduced mobility compared to recombinant HEXIM1. Again, RNase A treatment compressed virtually all HEXIM1 signals to a discrete band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Consistent with the biochemical fractionation result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), immunofluorescence staining with affinity-purified anti-HEXIM1 antibodies demonstrated that most HEXIM1 was localized in the nucleus, while a portion of HEXIM1 was detectable in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C).

Although it might be expected that pre-mir-16-1 RNA (89&#x02009;nt) would bind to HEXIM1 based on its content of double-stranded regions, it was not detected in this study.

Although dsDNA could interact with HEXIM1, dsRNA exhibited at least 100-fold higher affinity. We also provided evidence that dsRNA, but not dsDNA, binding induced a large conformational change in HEXIM1, which allows it to recruit P-TEFb. Significantly, P-TEFb kinase activity was inhibited in this complex. Furthermore, we showed that endogenous HEXIM1 localized in both cytoplasm and the nucleus, and the majority of HEXIM1 in both locations was generally associated with RNA.</p><p>Several previous studies have analyzed the potential secondary structure of 7SK and the regions that support association with HEXIM1. In an extensive analysis of 7SK sequences required for association of HEXIM1 and P-TEFb in HeLa cells, Egloff <italic>et al</italic>. found that many mutations within the first 100&#x02009;nt of 7SK resulted in the loss of HEXIM1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Their mutations were based on a structure proposed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) that mapped chemical and nuclease sensitivities of 7SK RNA and 7SK RNPs pulled out of cells. In that study, most of the results supported the proposed structure, but several sites of moderate modification (for example, U28, U30 and U66) were inexplicably found embedded in stems, not loops, as predicted from the known function of the modification reagents used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). If mFold is used to predict the secondary structure of the first 100&#x02009;nt of 7SK, two different structures are predicted that have similar thermodynamic stability (Supplementary Figure 1). One (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> = &#x02212;40.06&#x02009;kcal/mole) is very similar to that proposed by Wasserman and Steitz, and the other (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> = &#x02212;40.37&#x02009;kcal/mole) is completely different. In the slightly more stable second structure, U28, U30 and U66 are present in two prominent loops instead of stems. The complete chemical and nuclease sensitivity data would be accommodated, if the isolated 7SK RNP contained a mixture of the two structures. The structure predicted for 7SK 10&#x02013;48 used in our study is present in the alternative structure predicted for the entire 1&#x02013;100&#x02009;nt of 7SK (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> with Supplementary Figure 1). Our results clearly demonstrate that HEXIM1 can bind to 7SK 10&#x02013;48 or other short dsRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, determination of what 7SK structure is present when HEXIM1 and P-TEFb are associated <italic>in vivo</italic> will require chemical modification analysis of the RNA in 7SK RNPs pulled down with antibodies to HEXIM1 or P-TEFb.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated that dsRNA can functionally replace 7SK <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that most HEXIM1 is associated with RNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>, yet in cells, 7SK is the only identified RNA that allows formation of a complex with both HEXIM1 and P-TEFb. A small stem and loop near the 3&#x02032; end of 7SK has been shown to be essential for P-TEFb association <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, our results indicate that that region of 7SK is not needed <italic>in vitro</italic> and, in fact, that no region of 7SK is needed for the dsRNA-dependent conformational change that results in recruitment and inhibition of P-TEFb. Because the two studies measured HEXIM1 and P-TEFb binding under very different conditions, the results are not contradictory. However, they suggest an interesting possibility. There could be a modification in HEXIM1, for example in its P-TEFb interaction domain, which prevents it from interacting with P-TEFb even when bound with RNAs. This modification would not be present on the recombinant HEXIM1 utilized for the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments here, but could be present on the endogenous HEXIM1. A factor associated with the 3&#x02032; end of 7SK, but not other RNAs, could be responsible for removing this negative modification from HEXIM1, thereby allowing only 7SK&#x02022;HEXIM1 but not other RNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 complexes to recruit P-TEFb.</p><p>The finding that HEXIM1 is a dsRNA-binding protein is surprising because 7SK has been previously regarded as the only RNA associated with HEXIM1. Although dsDNA could interact with HEXIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), this interaction can be readily displaced by dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). On the contrary, dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 interaction is very stable and cannot be disrupted by dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Our results demonstrate that HEXIM1 prefers to bind A-form nucleic acids, and also suggest that dsDNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 interaction may not be physiologically relevant. Our unpublished data indicated that the minimal length of dsRNA for HEXIM1 interaction is 12&#x02009;bp. However, there are no uninterrupted helices of &#x0003e;10&#x02009;nt in 7SK and 7SK (10&#x02013;48) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Taking into consideration that HEXIM1 is a dimer with two RNA-interaction regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and HEXIM1 monomer does not bind RNA (data not shown), each HEXIM1 RNA-interaction region may bind a short stretch of dsRNA, and the distance between the two RNA-interaction regions has to be at least the length of a 12-bp dsRNA. It is not clear if structures in between the two short stretches of dsRNA regions contribute significantly to the dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 interaction.</p><p>We provide two lines of evidence to support the previous hypothesis that RNA binding induces a conformational change in N-terminal self-inhibitory domain of HEXIM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The first line of evidence came from the observation that dsRNA reduced the mobility of HEXIM1 dramatically. There are two major determinants for a protein's mobility on a native gel, i.e. its overall negative charges and its shape. More negative charges and a compact conformation would give rise to a faster migration than a less negative charged and extended conformation. Considering that the overall negative charge of the dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 complex is increased significantly, one would expect that the mobility of HEXIM1 should increase. Instead, dsRNA&#x02022;HEXIM1 showed slower mobility than HEXIM1, suggesting that it adapts a more expanded conformation. In fact, HEXIM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), a HEXIM1 homolog that has a much shorter N-terminal domain, but otherwise shares high sequence identity with HEXIM1, showed increased mobility upon dsRNA binding (data not shown). The second line of evidence came from a large decrease in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and a slight shift of the emission peak upon dsRNA, but not dsDNA binding. Although a decrease in intrinsic fluorescence could be caused by the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by nucleic acids, only dsRNA, but not dsDNA, reduced the intrinsic fluorescence of HEXIM1 dramatically. In addition, only dsRNA, but not dsDNA, caused a shift of the emission wavelength. This is consistent with the observation, obtained from the native gel analysis, that only dsRNA but not dsDNA, reduces the mobility of HEXIM1 dramatically. Taking all the evidence into account, it is likely that, upon dsRNA binding, there is a conformational change in HEXIM1 that exposes the P-TEFb-binding site.</p><p>Another interesting observation is that after RNase A treatment, both cytoplasmic and nuclear HEXIM1 migrated the same as the recombinant HEXIM1 protein on a native gel. Recombinant HEXIM1 has been shown to be a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) under the same condition. Therefore, endogenous HEXIM1 is likely to be a dimer as well. The calculated molecular weight for a HEXIM1 dimer is 80&#x02009;kDa. However, biophysical studies estimated that endogenous HEXIM1, free of 7SK and P-TEFb, has a size of 95&#x02013;130&#x02009;kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Our observation that most endogenous HEXIM1 has RNAs associated could explain this apparent discrepancy.</p><p>dsRNA-binding proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as RNA editing, RNAi, viral defense and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Unlike most dsRNA-binding proteins, HEXIM1 lacks the characteristic 50&#x02013;100 amino acid dsRNA-binding motif (dsRBM). The RNA-binding ability of HEXIM1 largely depends on KHRR (amino acids 152&#x02013;155). On the other hand, like most, if not all, characterized dsRNA-binding proteins, HEXIM1 binds to any dsRNA, regardless of its primary sequence <italic>in vitro</italic>. Given this, a dsRNA substrate of one dsRNA-binding protein could easily be bound by other dsRNA proteins in the cell, resulting in crosstalk between different dsRNA-mediated pathways. However, some dsRNA-binding proteins do recognize specific dsRNA substrates in cells, and how this specificity is achieved remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42 B43 B44">42&#x02013;44</xref>). Our results do not at present demonstrate conclusively that HEXIM1 is involved in cellular processes other than controlling P-TEFb. However, future studies including the identification of other HEXIM1-bound RNAs may shed light on the function of the HEXIM1&#x02022;RNA complexes found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data is available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grants GM35500 (D.H.P.) and GM57001 (M.A.S.) and the American Heart Foundation fellowship 0510040Z (Q.L.).

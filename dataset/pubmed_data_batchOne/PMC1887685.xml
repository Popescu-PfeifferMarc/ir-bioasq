Within 30 s of blood contact, <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes bind natural anti&#x02013;<italic>Leishmania</italic> antibodies, which then activate the classical complement pathway and opsonization by the third component of complement. The opsonized promastigotes undergo an immune adherence reaction and bind quantitatively to erythrocyte CR1 receptors; opsonized <italic>Leishmania</italic> amastigotes also bind to erythrocytes. Progression of infection implies promastigote transfer from erythrocytes to acceptor blood leukocytes. After 10 min of ex vivo infection, 25% of all leukocytes contain intracellular parasites, indicating that blood cells are the early targets for the invading promastigotes. We propose that adaptation to the immune adherence mechanism aids <italic>Leishmania</italic> survival, promoting rapid promastigote phagocytosis by leukocytes. This facilitates host colonization and may represent the parasite's earliest survival strategy. In light of this mechanism, it is unlikely that infection-blocking vaccines can be developed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Leishmania</italic></kwd><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>immune adherence</kwd><kwd>natural antibodies</kwd><kwd>complement</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The Leishmanioses are a group of insect-transmitted parasitic diseases caused by trypanosomatid protozoans of the genus <italic>Leishmania.</italic> These protozoans have a heteroxenous life cycle, living first as sessile intracellular amastigotes in the vertebrate host, then as motile flagellated promastigotes in the gut lumen of the sandfly vector. Phlebotomine sandflies are telmophage diptera that feed from hematomas originated by laceration of superficial venules in the host dermis, and transmit the disease by inoculating promastigotes into the hematoma blood pool (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>To understand the <italic>Leishmania</italic> infective process, it is critical to delineate the early sequence of events from promastigote inoculation to its final entry into the macrophage (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). After inoculation, the promastigote interacts with opsonic serum factors and activates the complement system (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The third component of complement (C3)<sup>1</sup>&#x02013;coated parasite adheres to mononuclear phagocytes (MN) through CR1 and CR3 complement receptors (CRs), and phagocytosis ensues without triggering the cells' respiratory burst (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The promastigote then differentiates to the amastigote form within the phagolysosome, where it replicates. The infection is thought to spread after extensive parasite proliferation, leading to macrophage death, amastigote release into surrounding tissue, and entry into neighboring macrophages, all of which are aided by lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination of amastigotes and infected cells (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrate hosts, <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites reside in MN; therefore promastigote&#x02013;host cell interaction has been analyzed extensively in vitro with MN (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), PMN (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and skin Langerhans cells (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Promastigotes of several <italic>Leishmania</italic> species can also infect dendritic cells (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), canine sarcoma cells (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and human fibroblasts (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), although the route of entrance into sarcoma cells and fibroblasts does not appear to reflect the natural course of infection. Promastigote inoculation into the skin of laboratory animals has permitted study of the inflammatory reaction to <italic>Leishmania</italic> and has shown that the invading parasite interacts with myelomonocytic phagocytes before entering the macrophage (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therefore, in vitro analysis of promastigote&#x02013;MN binding does not appear to reflect the first cellular interaction that follows promastigote invasion of a susceptible host.</p><p>In this study, we have analyzed the early stages of promastigote&#x02013;host interaction in an ex vivo model of human blood infection with <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes. Within seconds of blood contact, we observed that promastigotes are opsonized by host natural antibodies that activate the classical complement pathway and deposit C3 on the parasite surface. The C3-coated promastigotes undergo an immune adherence (IA) reaction and bind to erythrocytes, thereby enhancing parasite phagocytosis by blood leukocytes and facilitates host colonization.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="MaterialsMethods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Parasites and Cultures.</title><p>

The rapid kinetics observed for the IA reaction suggested that this is not the case, for which the activation pathway of the complement cascade by <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes was studied. Classical pathway activation requires both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, whereas the alternative pathway requires only Mg<sup>2+</sup>; differential cation chelation thus permits identification of the activation pathway. In NHS adjusted to 10 mM EGTA and 7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is effectively chelated but free Mg<sup>2+</sup> is available for alternative pathway activation. The course of C3 deposition on the promastigote surface is shown in the presence of 25% NHS or Mg-EGTA&#x02013;treated 25% NHS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A). After 2&#x02013;3 min of incubation, C3 binding reaches a maximum and remains unchanged for the remainder of the time course. In contrast, C3 deposition in Mg-EGTA&#x02013;treated serum follows a slower course that varies depending on the <italic>Leishmania</italic> species studied. </p><p>The finding that <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes activate complement by the classical pathway prompted a search for anti-<italic>Leishmania</italic> antibodies in NHS. In 25% NHS, promastigotes are rapidly coated with IgG and IgM antibodies. The kinetic profile of IgM binding to <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic> is shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B). IgM binding to both species follows the same pattern, presenting a very rapid forward reaction. After 30&#x02013;60 s of incubation, IgM binding reaches a maximum, followed by a rapid, marked release of the bound antibody, amounting to &#x0223c;50% of that initially fixed. IgG binding to the parasite follows a similar course (data not shown). Promastigote C3 deposition dependence on IgM or IgG binding was analyzed in the presence of NHS, Ads-NHS with <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes, and Ads-NHS supplemented with IgM or IgG purified from the same serum pool. After one adsorption cycle, Ads-NHS C3 deposition capacity was reduced to 15% of that of NHS. Ads-NHS supplemented with purified IgM (100 &#x003bc;g) recovered 79% of its initial activity. In contrast, IgG addition (100 &#x003bc;g) only showed 24% activity recovery. Therefore, IgM binding to promastigotes is required for promastigote opsonization.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Characterization of the IA Reaction.</title><p>As the IA process is strictly dependent on serum factor activity and the presence of divalent ions in the incubation mixture, the role of these factors and the nature of the erythrocyte IA receptor were then studied. Serum and erythrocytes were subjected to several treatments, and their capacity to sustain the IA reaction tested (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). IA-promoting activity was lost from serum after heat inactivation, in the presence of &#x02265;1 mM EDTA, or after blockage of C3/C4 thiolester bonds by MA treatment. Purified C3 at physiological concentrations cannot alone restore the serum activity; however, when purified C3 was added to the mixture containing MA-treated serum, the IA reaction was restored to 42% of positive control levels. Under these conditions, the partial IA recovery must be due largely to alternative pathway C3b deposition. In addition, Ads-NHS supplemented with IgM, but not with IgG, recovers most of the IA capacity lost through adsorption, indicating that IgM binding to promastigotes is a prerequisite for the IA reaction. </p><p>The involvement of C3 suggested that erythrocyte CR1 participates in the IA reaction. To test this, erythrocytes were treated with AET (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) or trypsin (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), which destroy or inactivate CR1. In previous studies we confirmed (data not shown), that erythrocyte CR1 recognition by rabbit anti-CR1&#x02013;specific antiserum (R137) decays in parallel to erythrocyte incubation time with AET, and that AET-treated erythrocytes no longer bind opsonized promastigotes; again, after AET or trypsin treatment, no IA reaction was observed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). Anti-CR1&#x02013;specific polyclonal antibody R137 and mAb 3D9 blocked the E-P interaction in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the reaction was not inhibited either by the mAb 543 or the mAb J3D3, which recognize CR1 epitopes not directly related to the C3b binding site (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), or by mouse anti&#x02013;human erythrocyte serum.

IA rosettes were also formed by method B, followed by AO staining to permit visualization of the parasite surrounded by erythrocytes in the complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C).</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Amastigote IA.</title><p>To determine whether amastigotes also undergo IA, they were isolated from <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>&#x02013;infected BALB/c mice and incubated with washed erythrocytes and NHS as described in method B. NHS was replaced by either PBS or EDTA-treated NHS in control samples. After incubation, amastigotes were stained with AO and those with three or more bound erythrocytes were counted as IA rosettes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). More than 90% of amastigotes were attached to erythrocytes after 3 min of incubation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B), whereas no reaction was observed in controls. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Leukocyte-dependent IA Rosette Dissociation.</title><p>Progress of infection must imply transfer of promastigotes from IA rosettes to leukocyte acceptor cells. Promastigote transfer was studied with a cellular immune complex uptake assay (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) used to test whether leukocytes affect IA rosette dissociation during an ex vivo infection. <sup>111</sup>In-labeled promastigote IA rosettes formed in normal and leukocyte-depleted blood were incubated for varying periods of time and the parasite fraction cosedimenting with erythrocytes was determined. After 15 min of infection, &#x0223c;6% of the original IA rosettes had dissociated in the leukocyte-depleted sample, compared with 36% in the untreated sample (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A). Thus, the promastigote dissociation rate in the presence of leukocytes is sixfold more rapid than in their absence. The promastigote acceptor capacity of unfractionated blood leukocytes, PMN, and MN was then tested by incubating <sup>111</sup>In-labeled promastigote IA rosettes with the isolated leukocyte populations for varying periods of time. After each incubation period, leukocytes and erythrocyte-bound promastigotes were separated by Percoll centrifugation, and the [<sup>111</sup>In] cpm in each cell fraction determined. The kinetics and percentages of promastigotes released from the IA rosettes are shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B). In the presence of PMN, which have the highest acceptor capacity, IA rosette dissociation is very rapid, showing 79 and 93% promastigote release after 4 and 10 min of incubation, respectively, whereas IA rosette promastigote dissociation in the absence of leukocytes did not exceed 10%. After 4 min of incubation, isolated PMN showed 1.5-fold higher acceptor capacity on a per cell basis than did unfractionated leukocytes, and approximately twice that of MN. </p><p>After incubation and centrifugation, the parasites band to the top of the Percoll solution, where they form large, low-density IA complexes with leukocytes. If IA rosette dissociation is physiological, leukocytes should be engaged in active parasite phagocytosis. To test this prediction, human blood was infected ex vivo with promastigotes at a 1.5:1 parasite/ leukocyte ratio. The infection was terminated at different time intervals, the leukocytes isolated, and cell smears were Giemsa stained. After 5 min of incubation, numerous infected leukocytes could be observed, and after 10 min, &#x0223c;25% of the cells had intracellular parasites. At 60 min after infection nearly all blood phagocytes were parasitized, and their phagocytic efficiency was in the order PMN &#x0003e; MN &#x0003e; eosinophils. Few apparently intact leishmanias were observed in PMN and eosinophils, suggesting that these cells are engaged in parasite lysis. In contrast, leishmanias within monocytes showed a more clearly delimited morphology. Infected lymphoid cells were not found.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In natural leishmaniosis transmission, promastigotes undergo a brief but critical encounter with host blood during the sandfly blood meal. As macrophages are considered direct targets of the invading parasites, it was of interest to ascertain whether promastigotes interact with other host cell lineages before taking final residence in the macrophage. Therefore, we developed an ex vivo model of blood infection and found that upon contact with human blood, promastigotes are immediately coated by natural IgM and IgG anti&#x02013;<italic>Leishmania</italic> antibodies. Promastigote&#x02013;IgM association kinetics is very rapid, and parasite epitopes are saturated within 1 min of incubation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B). We have determined that anti&#x02013;<italic>Leishmania</italic> antibodies comprise 15&#x02013;30% of total NHS IgM (&#x0223c;1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M) (manuscript in preparation). As antibody activity depends on both its avidity and its local concentration (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), the velocity of the opsonizing reaction is not unexpected.</p><p>Fresh sera from most vertebrates contain natural antibodies that react with <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>); in nonimmune human sera, IgM and IgG antibodies have been reported that bind and agglutinate <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), as well as IgG that recognize <italic>Leishmania</italic> Gal &#x003b1; 1&#x02192; 3 Gal epitopes (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In spite of data indicating that IgM anti&#x02013;<italic>Leishmania</italic> antibodies activate the classical complement pathway and facilitate parasite phagocytosis (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), there appears to be a consensus that, with the reported exceptions of <italic>L. donovani</italic> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and metacyclic peanut lectin nonagglutinable <italic>L. major</italic> forms (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), promastigotes of the genus <italic>Leishmania</italic> activate complement by the alternative pathway (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The results reported here show that in humans natural IgM binding to <italic>Leishmania</italic> is the mechanism that triggers activation of the classical complement pathway. In 25% NHS, C3 binding to <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> promastigotes reaches its maximum level after 2&#x02013;3 min of incubation. Only when the classical pathway is blocked with Mg-EGTA does C3 binding follow alternative pathway kinetics (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A). These results can safely be extended to <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp, as similar complement activation patterns are also observed with <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. infantum</italic> promastigotes and with <italic>Crithidia</italic> choanomastigotes (data not shown). Furthermore, the role of antibody in promastigote opsonization contradicts the view that <italic>Leishmania</italic> invade host cells by nonopsonic phagocytosis (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>After incubation with human blood, the opsonized promastigotes bind to erythrocyte CR1, forming IA rosettes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, B and C). The erythrocyte&#x02013;promastigote&#x02013;C3b interaction is extremely rapid (<italic>k</italic>
<sub>+1</sub> = 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and is complete within 30 s of initiation. The close parallel between <italic>Leishmania</italic> IA and the binding of opsonized immune complexes to erythrocytes (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) indicate that these reactions share the same mechanism. For <italic>Leishmania</italic>, IgM binding is a prerequisite for opsonization, and promastigote-bound C3b is the only parasite ligand involved in erythrocyte IA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). Besides promastigotes, opsonized <italic>Leishmania</italic> amastigotes also bind to human erythrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, A and B), suggesting that IA may contribute to amastigote dissemination in the infected host. In addition to <italic>Leishmania</italic>, erythrocyte CR1 participates in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cytoadherence to primate erythrocytes (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), and probably also plays a part in red cell adhesion of serum-opsonized trypanosomes (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). We suggest that erythrocyte CR1 receptor&#x02013;mediated IA may thus have a paramount role in parasite invasion of primates.</p><p>After the IA reaction, continuity of infection requires that erythrocyte-bound promastigotes be shuttled to acceptor leukocytes through a cooperative mechanism involving <italic>Leishmania</italic>-bound C3b and iC3b fragments and cell complement CR1 and CR3 receptors (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Although it has been proposed that promastigote Zn-proteinase (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and leukocyte CR1 receptors (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) participate in promastigote-surface iC3b ligand generation, the erythrocyte CR1 receptor is the most logical physiological cofactor candidate for the enzymatic degradation of promastigote-bound C3b to iC3b by factor I. In addition to processing antigen-bound C3b to iC3b and C3dg fragments, erythrocytes efficiently enhance antigen-C3dg uptake by CR2 B lymphocyte receptors (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>); this mechanism may well be exploited by <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites to divert the host protective immune response.</p><p>In the ex vivo assay, at 10 min after infection, &#x0223c;25% of blood phagocytes were parasitized in the same proportions at which they are found in human blood (PMN &#x0003e; monocytes &#x0003e; eosinophils), implying that there is no preferential leukocyte target in early <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection. However, on a per cell basis isolated PMN do engulf approximately twice as many promastigotes as MN. Similar phagocytic capacity has been observed, although after much longer infection periods, in isolated human blood leukocytes infected in vitro with <italic>L. donovani</italic> amastigotes (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), and in tissue samples analyzed shortly after promastigote inoculation into hamsters (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and mice (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These ex vivo and in vivo experimental data, although seemingly identical, derive from different mechanisms. Based on the leukocyte composition of murine blood (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), the expected percentage of <italic>Leishmania</italic>-containing PMN after ex vivo infection should be &#x0223c;16%, rather than the 90% observed in the in vivo experiments. The ex vivo infection model therefore provides information on the type and proportion of leukocytes infected in situ, while in vivo data reflect the cellular infiltrate in the parasite-triggered inflammatory reaction. Nonprimate in vivo systems would thus appear to be unsuitable for recreating the very different early <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection conditions in primates.</p><p>IA plays a central role in the clearance of opsonized microorganisms and foreign particles from the circulation via their removal by phagocytes (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Accordingly, we propose that <italic>Leishmania</italic> adaptation to the host IA mechanism aids parasite survival by promoting rapid promastigote phagocytosis and leukocyte colonization. During <italic>Leishmania</italic> opsonization in human blood, promastigotes undergo three continuous reactions: natural antibody binding, followed by C3 deposition, followed by subsequent adherence to erythrocytes. Each reaction proceeds at a different velocity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Promastigote&#x02013;IgM binding and erythrocyte&#x02013;promastigote IA are very rapid, whereas promastigote C3 deposition by the classical pathway is a slower process. It is believed that IA proceeds faster than C3b deposition because erythrocyte CR1 receptors cluster on the cell surface and establish multipoint interactions with C3b ligands (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). This cooperative effect increases in such extent the overall CR1&#x02013;C3b interaction avidity, that only very few C3b molecules (between 60 and 3,000 molecules/cell) are required to produce a positive IA reaction (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). A similar phenomenon appears to occur in <italic>Leishmania</italic> IA. Within 30 s of ex vivo infection, &#x0003e;80% of <italic>Leishmania</italic> epitopes recognized by IgM are occupied, the IA reaction is completed, and promastigotes are being shuttled to blood phagocytes. Complement lysis of parasites is still negligible at this time, as only &#x0223c;5% (10,000 molecules) of the total C3 promastigote acceptor capacity has been deposited. Since in the presence of 25% NHS, 50% [<sup>111</sup>In] cpm release from labeled promastigotes is registered by 90 s, the IA mechanism could substantially aid <italic>Leishmania</italic> survival through promotion of promastigote phagocytosis by leukocytes, which provide a safe haven for the parasite. </p><p>The results of this study modify the current view of human <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection by emphasizing the fundamental role of natural antibodies in triggering parasite opsonization and confirming that, under physiological conditions, promastigotes activate complement only through the classical pathway. In addition, these data show that, under physiological conditions, <italic>Leishmania</italic> uses the IA mechanism to infect the host, and suggest that this adaptation may be an extremely early and very important parasite strategy for host invasion.</p><p>For some, immunoprophylaxis is the only hope for leishmaniosis control (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). The participation of natural antibodies in the mechanism used by <italic>Leishmania</italic> to infect the host renders improbable the development of infection-blocking vaccines. Emphasis should be placed on therapies aimed at protecting the host against high parasite load, which should limit disease transmission.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Manuela D&#x000ed;ez and Inmaculada Moreno for excellent technical assistance; Prof. Victor Nussenzweig and Dr. Santiago Rodr&#x000ed;guez de C&#x000f3;rdoba for providing the R137 anti&#x02013;human CR1 antiserum; Prof. Jurg Schifferli for mAbs 3D9 and J3D3; Dr. Fernando Vivanco for purified human C3; Dr. Joseph O.

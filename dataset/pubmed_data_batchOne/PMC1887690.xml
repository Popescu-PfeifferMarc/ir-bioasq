The only cell types to express C5 were keratinocytes at the site of DNA application and a small number of dendritic cells present in the draining lymph nodes. Antigen expression persisted for up to 12 wk in keratinocytes, but dendritic cells did not express C5 beyond 2 wk after vaccination. Cross-priming of dendritic cells by C5 expressed in keratinocytes did not occur unless keratinocyte death was induced by irradiation in vitro. CD4 T cells were activated in the draining lymph nodes only and subsequently migrated to the spleen, where memory T cells persisted for longer than 40 wk despite the absence of a source of persistent antigen. While DNA vaccination resulted in transfection of a small proportion of dendritic cells only, it led to general activation of all dendritic cells, thus providing optimal conditions for effective T cell activation and maintenance of memory. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>cross-presentation</kwd><kwd>T cell memory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Genetic immunization with naked DNA has been shown to induce humoral as well as cellular immune responses with high efficiency, emphasizing the enormous potential of this strategy for vaccination purposes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). DNA applied either intramuscularly or intradermally is mostly taken up by muscle cells or keratinocytes, respectively (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, these cells are unable to initiate primary T cell responses. Several recent studies have provided evidence for the involvement of dendritic cells (DC)<sup>1</sup> in priming naive T cells after DNA vaccination (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In many cases, the constructs used for vaccination led to secretion of the synthesized protein, so that it remained unclear to what extent DC participated in stimulating an immune response after direct transfection or through taking up antigen released by other transfected cells.</p><p>Successful priming of T cell responses generally requires the presence of adjuvant, whose role appears to lie in activating APCs. This is especially the case for CD8 T cells which are strictly dependent on T cell help unless they interact with activated DC (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Resting DC can be activated by inflammatory cytokines, bacterial products, and certain viruses, resulting in upregulation of MHC class II molecules and costimulatory molecules (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Unmethylated CpG motifs in nonvertebrate DNA have been described to have a potent adjuvant effect (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Here we show that vaccination with a DNA construct encoding a protein that is not secreted induces strong, long-lived CD4 T cell responses that are initiated in the draining lymph nodes by a small number of DC that express the antigen. Although DNA vaccination results in direct transfection of only a very small proportion of DC, it leads to general activation of all DC found in the draining lymph nodes, thus providing optimal conditions for effective T cell activation.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="MaterialsMethods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>A/J (C5<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the National Institute for Medical Research, London.

Control mice were vaccinated with the corresponding empty vector DNA or with C5 protein in CFA. 10 d later the draining lymph nodes were taken and tested in vitro for generation of C5-specific T cell responses. 5.4 vaccination and immunization with C5 protein generated C5-specific T cell responses upon restimulation with C5 protein in vitro, whereas mice vaccinated with empty vector did not mount a response (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A). However, only mice that had received C5 protein had generated C5-specific antibodies 3 wk later, although splenocytes from both groups generated strong C5-specific T cell responses upon restimulation in vitro (data not shown). To increase the chance for an antibody response, two mice from each group were reimmunized 3 wk after protein immunization or 5.4 vaccination with either C5 protein or vaccine and then bled for assessment of the antibody responses to C5 9 d later. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> B, C5 protein&#x02013;immunized mice produced anti-C5 antibodies of the IgG1 subclass as previously reported (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), whereas 5.4-vaccinated mice did not produce C5-specific antibodies of any subclass even after revaccination. We followed precursor frequencies for C5-specific IL-2 producing T cells in a cohort of 5.4-vaccinated mice for 40 wk and found that maximal frequencies are detectable around 4 wk after vaccination and decline slowly thereafter, but still remain above nontreated background controls at 40 wk after vaccination (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>DC Isolated from Draining Lymph Nodes of Vaccinated Mice Express C5 Protein.</title><p>DC from 5.4- and vector control&#x02013; vaccinated mice were isolated by magnetic cell sorting from draining lymph node cells and spleen and then assessed for the expression of C5 by RT-PCR. In addition, a suspension of ear skin cells (containing mainly keratinocytes) was analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A DC from draining lymph nodes, but not spleen of 5.4-vaccinated mice, express C5. Keratinocytes from the ears of 5.4-vaccinated mice also showed a positive RT-PCR. There was no C5 message detectable in DC from vector vaccinated&#x02013;control mice. Furthermore, the cell population depleted of DC from draining lymph nodes of 5.4-vaccinated mice, containing B and T cells, did not show a positive RT-PCR signal. This indicates that, in 5.4-vaccinated mice, a proportion of DC, which presumably migrated from the site of DNA application to the draining lymph nodes, had taken up the DNA construct and synthesized C5 protein. With the exception of keratinocytes at the site of DNA application no other cell population was found to contain C5 message. In contrast to this, C5 DNA was demonstrable in lymph node and spleen, albeit at much smaller amounts in the latter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, B and C). This suggests that DNA applied to ear skin gains access to the circulation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>A Small Proportion of DC Is Transfected and Cross-presentation of Protein from Transfected Keratinocytes Occurs Only in a Situation of Excessive Cell Death.</title><p>In an attempt to quantify the number of DC in draining lymph nodes which express the C5 construct, we set up functional studies and confocal analysis. The 5.4 construct used contains GFP expressed under a second promoter to allow direct visualization of transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy. FACS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> analysis of DC isolated by magnetic cell sorting 10 d after vaccination did not give a clear signal, presumably because of the very low incidence of transfection. However, GFP containing DC were clearly identifiable by confocal microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> D). DC from draining lymph nodes of 5.4-vaccinated mice were then tested for their capacity to activate the C5-specific T cell hybrid A18. In parallel a standard curve was set up by combining various numbers of DC that had been pulsed with C5 protein, followed by washing, with nonpulsed DC and A18 T cells. Comparing the T cell responses obtained, we estimate that &#x0223c;2% of the DC in the draining lymph nodes of vaccinated mice processed and presented C5 in the context of MHC class II molecules for recognition by A18 T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> E). A recent study (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) also illustrated that DC from vaccinated mice could stimulate T cells in the absence of added antigen. However, in this case the protein encoded by the DNA construct was secreted so that it was not possible to define to what extent the stimulatory capacity of DC was due to direct transfection, compared with uptake of protein synthesized and released by other transfected cells. Although the 5.4 C5 construct does not give rise to secreted C5 protein, there is now substantial evidence that DC can take up protein from other cells by a mechanism referred to as cross-priming (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We tested this by coculturing keratinocytes from 5.4-vaccinated mice with untreated DC which were subsequently assayed for their ability to activate the A18 hybrid. This coculture assay is very sensitive, detecting as little as 6 ng/ml C5 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), but in the presence of intact keratinocytes, which expressed C5 as shown by RT-PCR, there was no evidence of any protein transfer to DC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> F). In contrast, exposure of keratinocytes to 1,000 Rad irradiation before coculture with DC resulted in strong C5 presentation by the DC. This indicates that cell death induced by this treatment allows cross-priming of dendritic cells for presentation in the context of MHC class II.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>DNA Vaccination Results in Activation of DC.</title><p>DC isolated by magnetic cell sorting from draining lymph nodes of 5.4- or control vector&#x02013;vaccinated mice were tested for expression of cell surface molecules that are important in T cell stimulation, such as CD40, B7.1, B7.2, and ICAM-1. Both 5.4 vaccine and vector resulted in strong upregulation of these molecules on all DC found in the draining lymph nodes compared with DC from untreated controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), illustrating that DNA vaccination, in a nonspecific manner, provides the necessary stimuli for activation of DC; this is in accordance with recent observations that bacterial DNA and synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides promote DC activation and maturation in vitro (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Kinetics and Site of T Cell Activation after DNA Vaccination of Transgenic Mice.</title><p>To investigate the sites, kinetics, and extent of T cell activation after DNA vaccination, we made use of T cell receptor transgenic (A18 TCRtg) mice, as normal mice have very low precursor frequencies for C5-specific T cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). All CD4 T cells found in the A18 TCRtg strain on a Rag<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background are specific for epitope 106-121 of C5 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and have a naive phenotype as evidenced by their low expression of CD44 and CD69 and high expression of CD62-L. A cohort of A18 TCRtg mice was vaccinated with the 5.4 or vector control construct. At the same time two vaccinated mice per group were injected with BrdU and received BrdU in the drinking water for the next 3 d. 3 d later, the draining lymph nodes and spleens from BrdU-treated mice were analyzed for expression of activation markers on CD4 T cells and incorporation of BrdU. In 5.4-vaccinated mice, all CD4 T cells from lymph nodes draining the site of vaccination had incorporated BrdU, indicating activation and division (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). CD69, an early activation marker, was upregulated and CD62-L showed some degree of downregulation, whereas no significant changes were observed in CD44 levels yet. CD4 T cells from mice vaccinated with vector control construct or from untreated mice retained their naive phenotype. Whereas CD4 T cells from draining lymph nodes of 5.4-vaccinated mice all appear to be activated 3 d after vaccination, splenic CD4 T cells had neither incorporated BrdU nor showed any changes in activation markers. This indicates that T cell activation is initiated in the draining lymph nodes and that, in contrast to DC, antigen-specific T cells are only activated by DNA encoding the corresponding antigen; there was no nonspecific activation by vector DNA alone. By day 15 after vaccination, all CD4 T cells in lymph node and spleen of 5.4-vaccinated mice expressed an activated phenotype, characterized by downregulation of CD62-L and upregulation of CD44 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B), whereas T cells in control mice showed no signs of activation. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>The Source of Stimulatory Antigen Is Short-lived in Vaccinated Mice.</title><p>To test for the continuous presence of antigen in 5.4-vaccinated mice, two approaches were used. First, DC of the draining lymph nodes and keratinocytes at the site of injection were analyzed for expression of C5 by RT-PCR from 1 to 20 wk after vaccination. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows that, for DC, C5 expression was not demonstrable later than 2 wk after vaccination, whereas keratinocytes continued to express C5 longer, until week 12. In addition, a sensitive in vivo test using naive transgenic A18 T cells was used to detect the presence of a persistent source of antigen for T cell priming. Naive A18 T cells carrying a different Thy 1 allotype (Thy1.1) and labeled with the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate-succinimidylester (CFSE) to allow monitoring of cell division (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) were injected into host mice that had been vaccinated 20 d before. 7 d after injection, the mice were killed and the phenotype of the injected T cell population was analyzed in FACS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Thy1.1 A18 T cells found in the draining lymph nodes of mice vaccinated 20 d before had retained their CFSE label and naive phenotype. Likewise, injected Thy1.1 A18 T cells present in the spleen had a naive phenotype (data not shown). Thus, it appears that 20 d after vaccination there is no longer any source of stimulatory antigen present. </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The success of DNA vaccination is linked to initiation of T cell responses by DC. There are various routes by which DC can obtain the protein they present. They can either take up protein secreted by other cell types which were transfected after DNA vaccination, or pick up antigen from transfected cells, an as yet ill-defined mechanism referred to as cross-presentation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Additionally, they can be transfected themselves (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In this paper we used a DNA construct encoding a form of C5 protein which is not secreted by transfected cells with the aim to limit its accessibility to APCs and investigate the consequences for priming and maintenance of CD4 T cell responses. It is not known what causes the block in secretion of C5, but we determined recently that addition of an optimal leader sequence to the construct results in C5 secretion. The exclusive intracellular expression of the 5.4 construct after transfection into many different cell types, such as fibroblasts, B cells, macrophages, and hepatocytes, has been tested extensively (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In addition, its restricted localization is supported by the absence of antibody responses after vaccination. Thus, C5 message was only detectable in keratinocytes at the site of vaccination and in a small proportion of DC within the draining lymph nodes. We assume that these migrated there from the site of DNA application in the ear skin, although we cannot exclude the possibility that DC also were transfected in the draining lymph nodes themselves because of relatively high levels of DNA at this site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B). Functional analysis of their stimulatory capacity for C5-specific T cells suggested that &#x0223c;2% of the lymph node DC presented antigen. A recent study (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) likewise concluded that activation of CD8 T cells is achieved through direct transfection of a small proportion of DC that migrate from the skin to the draining lymph nodes. Although it is possible that this reflects the number of directly transfected DC, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that some of these DC acquired C5 protein expressed in keratinocytes by cross-presentation. Notably, no antigen was transferred to DC from intact keratinocytes, whereas irradiation of keratinocytes provided a strong stimulus for cross-presentation.</p><p>It is still a matter of debate whether normal cell turnover by apoptosis in vivo results in release of antigenic material which could be obtained for presentation by DC or whether this event only occurs in inflammatory situations encountered during necrosis of cells or tissue (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), or in infection induced apoptosis as described by Albert et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). While there is no obvious sign of inflammation, such as swelling after scarification of the ears, it is nevertheless possible that some keratinocytes die in a manner that results in cross-presentation by skin DC, which then migrate to the draining lymph nodes to activate T cells. However, this event is unlikely to take place at later time points after vaccination when the site of scarification has healed.</p><p>Although keratinocytes were shown to express C5 up to 12 wk after vaccination, the presence of antigen in these cells is unlikely to be responsible for the persistence of T cell memory beyond 40 wk. DC have been described to have a half-life of &#x0003c;1 wk in mouse spleen, and those DC present in lymphoid organs no longer proliferate (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We found no evidence of C5 expressing DC in the spleen, indicating that the transfected DC found in draining lymph nodes do not migrate to other lymphoid organs. The absence of C5 expression in DC beyond 2 wk after vaccination, together with the fact that a fresh cohort of naive transgenic T cells failed to be activated when injected into mice that had been vaccinated 20 d before, support the conclusion that there is no long-lived source of antigenic material present. Considering the absence of an antibody response, it is also unlikely that antigen was stored in the form of antigen&#x02013;antibody complexes on follicular DC, which are known to be highly efficient depots of long-lived antigen (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Therefore, it seems that DNA vaccination can induce memory CD4 T cells that can be long-lived without repeated antigenic stimulation.</p><p>The potent immunostimulatory activity of unmethylated CpG motifs present in bacterial plasmid DNA (for review see reference <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) may have important implications for priming and maintenance of T cell responses. The data in this paper show that DNA provides activation signals to DC. While only a very low fraction of DC expressed C5, all DC in the draining lymph nodes showed an activated phenotype. It is highly likely that scarification itself provided an activation signal to Langerhans cells in the skin, provoking them to migrate to the draining lymph nodes. However, it is unlikely that all DC found in the draining lymph nodes were derived from Langerhans cells, suggesting instead that DNA present in the lymph nodes was responsible for activation of resident DC and DC that may have been recruited from the circulation. Influx of DC or expansion from precursors may take place after DNA vaccination since total DC numbers in draining lymph nodes increase (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). It has been reported that DNA vaccines administered by the gene gun method gain access to the circulation, because immediate removal of the ear after vaccination does not prevent an immune response (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). This seems to happen after scarification as well, since PCR analysis showed strong positive signals for C5 DNA in lymph node and weaker expression in spleen. Therefore, small amounts of DNA reaching the circulation apparently exert stimulatory activity on many cell types, but fail to be transcribed and translated into protein.</p><p>In view of recent data showing the crucial importance of DC activation for stimulation of CD8 T cell responses, the finding that DNA vaccination nonspecifically activates a large number of dendritic cells suggests that this type of genetic immunization provides ideal conditions not only for CD4 T cell responses, but especially for the initiation of CD8 T cell responses. Therefore, the success in achieving long-lived memory responses by DNA vaccination may lie in optimal activation and expansion of most antigen-specific T cell precursors, rather than in long-term storage of antigen leading to periodic restimulation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1"><label>1</label><p>

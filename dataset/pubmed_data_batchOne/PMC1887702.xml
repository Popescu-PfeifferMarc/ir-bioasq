Kaposi's sarcoma&#x02013;associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes a transforming protein called K1, which has structural and functional similarity to Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2;. We demonstrate that K1 downregulates the expression of BCR complexes on the surface. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 specifically interacts with the &#x003bc; chains of BCR complexes, and this interaction retains BCR complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing their intracellular transport to the cell surface. Thus, KSHV K1 resembles Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; in its ability to induce signaling and to interact with &#x003bc; chains of the BCR. However, unlike Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2;, which interact with &#x003bc; chains to direct BCR complexes to the cell surface, K1 interacts with &#x003bc; chains to block the intracellular transport of BCR complexes to the cell surface. These results demonstrate a unique feature of the K1 transforming protein, which may confer virus-infected cells with a long-term survival advantage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Kaposi's sarcoma&#x02013;associated herpesvirus</kwd><kwd>K1</kwd><kwd>B cell antigen receptor</kwd><kwd>downregulation</kwd><kwd>intracellular transport</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>During biosynthesis, transmembrane proteins are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and become anchored in the membrane. In the case of multiprotein complexes, all components should assemble before transport via the Golgi complex to the cell surface can occur. As an important step in quality control, incorrectly assembled protein complexes or assembly intermediates are retained in the ER, ensuring that only functional proteins become expressed on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>.</p><p>The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) consists of a disulfide-linked tetramer of two transmembrane mIg heavy (&#x003bc;) chains in covalent association with two light (&#x003bb; or &#x003ba;) chains <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>. In addition, the BCR complex contains a disulfide-linked heterodimer formed by Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2;, which serves to direct the receptor complexes to the cell surface and to provide receptor signaling capacity <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref>. Analysis of sequence elements responsible for the signaling properties of the transducing subunits of BCR has led to the identification of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM [5]). This motif consists of six conserved amino acid residues spaced precisely over an &#x0223c;26 amino acid sequence, D/Ex<sub>7</sub>D/Ex<sub>2</sub>YxxLx<sub>7</sub>YxxL/I, and a single copy of this motif is present in the cytoplasmic region of Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>. Because the Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; heterodimer is essential for the signaling capacity of the receptor, it is essential that only fully assembled BCR complexes appear on the cell surface. Therefore, the expression levels of the individual components as well as assembly of oligomers and transport through intracellular compartments are subject to various intracellular control mechanisms.</p><p>Association of the Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; heterodimer is essential for intracellular transport and plasma membrane deposition of newly synthesized mIg molecules. The site of intracellular retention of mIg in absence of this heterodimer is the ER. This retention has been found to be dictated by two regions of the &#x003bc; chain of mIg, the transmembrane region and the first constant region. The transmembrane region of the &#x003bc; chain controls its interaction with the ER chaperone calnexin <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>, whereas the first constant domain of the &#x003bc; chain is important for association with the ER-resident Ig heavy chain binding protein <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>. These interactions of the &#x003bc; chain with the ER-resident proteins have been shown to be an important control mechanism for surface expression of the BCR complexes <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>.</p><p>A new human tumor virus, called Kaposi's sarcoma&#x02013;associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), has been consistently identified in Kaposi's sarcoma tumors from HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>

K1 gene is expressed at low levels in PEL, and its expression is significantly induced during the lytic viral life cycle <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref>.

<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref>. In addition, similar to Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2;, the cytoplasmic region of K1 contains a functional ITAM that is capable of transducing signals to elicit cellular activation events <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref>

For stable expression, the EcoRI and XhoI DNA fragment containing the K1/CD8 chimera sequence was cloned into pcDNA3-Neo (Invitrogen). A new pDEF3&#x02013;glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-AU1 fusion plasmid was constructed to contain the CMV early promoter and multicloning sites linked to the GST gene, which is tagged with an AU1 epitope at its COOH terminus. To construct the K1/GST fusion expression construct, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 was PCR amplified and fused in frame into the pDEF3-GST-AU1 vector. All PCR-amplified DNA fragments were completely sequenced to verify the presence of the correct sequence and the absence of any other changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot.</title><p>For metabolic labeling, cells were rinsed three times with PBS, washed once with labeling medium (RPMI minus methionine and cysteine plus 10% dialyzed FCS), and then incubated with 5 ml of the same medium containing 100 &#x003bc;Ci of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and [<sup>35</sup>S]cysteine (NEN Life Science Products) for 16 h. For pulse-chase analysis, cells were labeled for 30 min and chased for 1, 3, or 4 h. Cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 1% NP-40 or 1% digitonin, and 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 8.0) containing 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>VO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaF, and protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, PMSF, and bestatin). Immunoprecipitation was performed with 1:500 diluted antibody together with 30 &#x003bc;l of protein A/G agarose beads. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) digestion was performed for 2 h with washed immunoprecipitates as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer). For protein immunoblots, polypeptides in cell lysates corresponding to 10<sup>5</sup> cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane filter. Immunoblot detection was performed with a 1:1,000 or 1:3,000 dilution of primary antibody using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse anti-AU1 ascites were purchased from BABCO.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy.</title><p>Slides for cells grown in suspension were prepared by cytospin centrifugation. After air drying, cells were fixed with cold acetone for 15 min and blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 min. Cells were stained with 1:100 diluted primary antibody in PBS containing 1% gelatin for 30 min. After incubation, cells were washed extensively with PBS and incubated with 1,100 diluted Alexa 568&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) and Alexa 488&#x02013;conjugated Con A for ER-specific staining (Molecular Probes) in PBS containing 1% gelatin for 30 min at room temperature. For Golgi compartment staining, cells were metabolically labeled with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml boron dipyrromethane (BODIPY) C5FL-ceramide for 30 min as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes). Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted in mounting media (Vector Laboratories). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS-SP laser scanning microscope fitted with a 100&#x000d7; Leica objective (Planapochromatic; 1.4 numerical aperture), and using the Leica image software. Images were collected at 512 &#x000d7; 512 pixel resolution. The stained cells were optically sectioned in the z-axis, and the images in the different channels (photomultiplier tubes) were collected simultaneously. The step size in the z-axis varied from 0.2&#x02013;0.5 &#x003bc;m to obtain 30&#x02013;50 slices per image filed.

The full-length K1 gene was modified to encode an AU1 epitope tag at the COOH terminus, and was cloned into the retroviral vector pBabe-puro. After electroporation of this retroviral vector into BJAB cells, control BJAB/babe and BJAB/K1 cell lines were selected by growth in medium containing 5 &#x003bc;g/ml of puromycin. To demonstrate expression of the K1 gene in puromycin-resistant cells, radioactively labeled cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with an anti-AU1 antibody. A 55-kD K1 was detected only from BJAB cells containing the K1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A). As shown in fibroblast cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>, the expression of K1 also resulted in morphological changes of BJAB cells; BJAB/K1 cells were irregularly shaped and had a rough surface, whereas control BJAB cells were roundly shaped and had a smooth surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B).</p><p>When surface expression of lymphocyte antigen was examined, a dramatic reduction in the surface expression of IgM and Ig&#x003b2; was observed in BJAB/K1 compared with control BJAB/babe cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, CD11a, CD18, CD19, CD21, CD22, CD29, CD30, CD40, CD50, CD54, B7-1, B7-2, MHC class I, and HLA-DR did not show detectable changes in their surface expression under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>; data not shown). Three independently constructed BJAB/K1 cell lines showed the same results (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the expression of K1 in BJAB cells downregulates surface expression of BCR components IgM and Ig&#x003b2; in a specific manner.</p></sec><sec><title>The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal Region of K1 Is Required for BCR Downregulation.</title><p>To identify the region of K1 that accounted for downregulation of BCR surface expression, BJAB cells containing a chimeric protein between K1 and human CD8&#x003b1; were established by electroporation with an expression vector. In the chimera K1/CD8-Ex, the extracellular region of K1 was replaced with that of CD8&#x003b1;; in the chimera K1/CD8-Tm, the transmembrane region of K1 was replaced with that of CD8&#x003b1;; and in the chimera K1/CD8-Ex+Tm, the extracellular and transmembrane regions of K1 were replaced with those of CD8&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, CD8-Ex+Tm containing its extracellular and transmembrane region was included as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Comparable levels of CD8 surface expression of transfected cells were detected (data not shown). However, upon expression of CD8-Ex+Tm, K1/CD8-Ex, and K1/CD8-Ex+Tm chimeras, BCR did not undergo appreciable levels of downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, K1/CD8-Tm expression induced significant levels of BCR downregulation, as was seen with a wild-type K1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>To further examine whether the COOH-terminal ITAM sequence of K1 contributed to the downregulation of BCR surface expression, the tyrosine residues at positions 271, 272, and/or 282 were replaced with phenylalanines, called K1/YY/FF, K1/Y<sub>282</sub>F, and K1/TYF (reference 23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, deletion mutations were introduced into the cytoplasmic region of K1, resulting in the K1/D1, K1/D2, and K1/D3 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). As described previously <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref>, K1/D1 contains the negatively charged conserved region with a proximal YXXL motif, K1/D2 contains only the negatively charged conserved region, and K1/D3 contains both YXXL/P motifs without the negatively charged conserved region. After electroporation of retroviral vectors containing these mutants, BJAB cells were selected by growth in medium containing 5 &#x003bc;g/ml of puromycin, and were examined for their IgM surface expression by flow cytometry. Similar to wild-type K1, all these K1 mutants induced drastic downregulation of BCR surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These results demonstrate that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1, but not the transmembrane and COOH-terminal regions, is necessary for the downregulation of BCR surface expression.</p></sec><sec><title>The Retention of BCR Components in the ER of Cells Expressing K1.</title><p>We investigated whether K1 expression also affected intracellular localization of BCR components. BJAB and BJAB/K1 cells were stained with antibodies specific for Ig&#x003b1;, Ig&#x003b2;, or &#x003bc; chains, followed by reaction with Alexa 568&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibody (red). Confocal microscopy of the immunostained cells showed that the localization of &#x003bc; chains was significantly affected by K1 expression. &#x003bc; chains were primarily localized in the plasma membrane in control BJAB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). In contrast, they were predominantly localized at the perinuclear region in BJAB/K1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). Because this perinuclear staining pattern is similar to that obtained when the ER is visualized, we further defined the localization of &#x003bc; chains, using Alexa 488&#x02013;conjugated (green) Con A for ER-specific staining or BODIPY C5FL-ceramide for Golgi compartment&#x02013;specific staining. Confocal microscopy showed that &#x003bc; chains in K1-expressing cells were primarily localized in the ER but not in the Golgi compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). When an anticalnexin antibody for ER localization <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref> and an anti&#x02013;Golgi compartment 58K antibody for Golgi compartment localization <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R25">25</xref> were used for immunofluorescence tests, essentially the same results were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Similar to &#x003bc; chains, Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; were predominantly localized in the ER in BJAB/K1 cells, whereas they were present in both the plasma membrane and the ER in BJAB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. c</xref>). In addition, confocal microscopy with several different antibodies showed a lower level of Ig&#x003b2; detection in BJAB/K1 cells than in BJAB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C). These results demonstrated that K1 expression led to the retention of BCR subunits in the ER.</p></sec><sec><title>Maturation and Assembly of BCR Components.</title><p>ER-localized glycoproteins bear immature N-linked glycans, which mature during intracellular transport to the medial-Golgi compartment <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R26">26</xref>. To investigate the maturation of BCR components, BJAB and BJAB/K1 cells were metabolically labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and [<sup>35</sup>S]cysteine for 30 min, chased for 1 and 4 h, and lysed by 1% NP-40 detergent. Individual BCR components, Ig&#x003b1;, Ig&#x003b2;, and &#x003bc; chains, were precipitated with their specific antibodies. In addition to a 70-kD &#x003bc; chain protein, a 72-kD mature form of &#x003bc; chain was detected during a chase period in BJAB cells but not in BJAB/K1 cells, indicating that the &#x003bc; chains of BCR underwent maturation in BJAB cells but not in BJAB/K1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Ig&#x003b1; has been shown to migrate with an apparent molecular weight of 37, 40, and 43 kD <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R27">27</xref>. Unlike &#x003bc; chains, no specific change of Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; maturation was detected in K1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). These results demonstrated that K1 expression specifically blocked the maturation of the &#x003bc; chains of BCR subunits.</p><p>To investigate the effect of K1 on BCR assembly, BJAB and BJAB/K1 cells were metabolically labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and [<sup>35</sup>S]cysteine for 30 min, chased for 1 and 3 h, and lysed by 1% digitonin detergent to preserve assembled BCR complexes. Assembled BCR complexes were then precipitated with antibody specific to Ig&#x003b1;, Ig&#x003b2;, or &#x003bc; chain. Similar amounts of Ig&#x003b1;, Ig&#x003b2;, or &#x003bc; chain were detected in each immune complex of BJAB and BJAB/K1 cells, suggesting that K1 did not significantly affect BCR assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). However, consistent with immunoprecipitation in NP-40 lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), a maturation of &#x003bc; chains was not detected in K1-expressing cells, whereas it was evident in control BJAB/babe cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> B). These results indicated that although K1 did not affect the level of BCR assembly and expression, it specifically inhibited maturation of &#x003bc; chains by retaining BCR complexes in the ER.</p></sec><sec><title>Endo H Sensitivity of BCR Components.</title><p>Carbohydrate moieties of BCR complexes contain high mannose-type oligosaccharides in the ER that are susceptible to Endo H digestion.

To further investigate the effect of K1 on the intracellular transport of BCR complexes, BJAB control cells and BJAB/K1 cells were metabolically labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and [<sup>35</sup>S]cysteine for 30 min and chased for 1, 3, or 4 h. BCR components, &#x003bc; chains, Ig&#x003b1;, and Ig&#x003b2;, were precipitated with their specific antibodies.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, &#x003bc; chains remained Endo H sensitive in BJAB/K1 cells, whereas they acquired resistance to Endo H cleavage in BJAB cells. In contrast, Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; underwent Endo H digestion in both cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> B). As all three species of Ig&#x003b1; were sensitive to Endo H digestion, it also suggested that maturation of Ig&#x003b1; may be different from that of &#x003bc; chains. In summary, these results further confirmed that K1 retained BCR complexes in the ER.</p></sec><sec><title>ER Localization of K1.</title><p>To investigate the role of K1 in the ER retention of BCR complexes, we examined the subcellular localization of K1 by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. BJAB cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the epitope-tagged K1 gene, the flag-K1 containing a flag epitope at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref>, or the K1-myc containing a myc epitope at the COOH terminus <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>. An expression vector containing the human CD4 gene was included as a control. 2 d after transfection, cells were stained with anti-flag, anti-myc, or anti-CD4 antibody, followed by an Alexa 568&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibody (red). In addition, Alexa 488&#x02013;conjugated (green) Con A was used for ER-specific staining, and BODIPY C5FL-ceramide was used for Golgi compartment&#x02013;specific staining. The confocal microscopy analysis showed that the K1 protein was predominantly localized in the ER, not in the Golgi compartment, whereas &#x0223c;10&#x02013;20% of the K1 protein was detected in plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). In striking contrast, &#x0003e;80% of CD4 was detected in the plasma membrane under the same conditions (data not shown). These results demonstrate that K1 is primarily localized in the ER, and only a portion of K1 is translocated into the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal Region of K1 with the &#x003bc; Chains.</title><p>Because K1 downregulates BCR in a specific manner, is primarily localized in the ER, and its NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region is necessary for BCR downregulation, we hypothesized that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 interacted with BCR components and that this interaction led to their retention in the ER. To test this hypothesis, BJAB cells were transfected with expression vector containing a full-length flag-tagged K1 gene. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed by 1% NP-40 detergent, followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-flag antibody. Polypeptides present in anti-flag immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted with an antibody specific for &#x003bc; chains, Ig&#x003b1; or Ig&#x003b2;. These experiments showed that &#x003bc; chains were readily detected in K1 immune complexes, whereas Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; were not detected at appreciable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref> A; data not shown). We further investigated whether K1 was capable of interacting with the &#x003bc; chains in the absence of other BCR subunits. To test this, the flag-tagged K1 and the &#x003bc; expression vectors were transfected into the human 293 epithelial cell line. Immune complexes of an anti-flag antibody or anti-&#x003bc; antibody were immunoblotted with anti-&#x003bc; antibody and anti-flag antibodies. These experiments demonstrated that K1 was capable of interacting with the &#x003bc; chains in the absence of other BCR subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref> B).</p><p>To further demonstrate the interaction of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 with &#x003bc; chains, we constructed a K1/GST-AU1 fusion mammalian expression plasmid in which the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 containing seven potential <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites was fused in frame into GST-AU1. After transfection of a K1/GST-AU1 expression vector into BJAB cells, glycosylated K1/GST-AU1 fusion complexes were purified from cell lysates by glutathione affinity chromatography and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific for a &#x003bc; chain. These experiments showed that K1/GST-AU1 interacted with &#x003bc; chains, whereas GST-AU1 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>). This result indicates that the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 specifically interacts with &#x003bc; chains of BCR complexes, and that this interaction is likely responsible for the ER retention of BCR complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We and others have previously demonstrated the signal transducing and transforming ability of K1 <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref>. In this report, we further demonstrate that K1 expression specifically induces downregulation of BCR surface expression. The interaction of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 with the &#x003bc; chains of BCR complexes likely retains these complexes in the ER, resulting in downregulation of their surface expression. These results indicate that a KSHV K1 transforming protein is capable of eliciting cellular signal transduction as well as of inhibiting intracellular transport of BCR. Both activities of K1 may be necessary to provide an advantageous environment for virus-infected cells in vivo.</p><p>Association of newly synthesized &#x003bc; chain of BCR molecules with Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; is essential for their intracellular transport and plasma membrane deposition <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>. The predicted size and structure of the K1 has a significant resemblance to those of a single-domain Ig superfamily receptor <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R22">22</xref>. In addition, similar to Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2;, the cytoplasmic region of K1 contains a functional ITAM sequence that is capable of transducing signals to elicit cellular activation events <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref>. In this report, we further demonstrate that, similar to Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2;, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 interacts with &#x003bc; chains of BCR. Thus, KSHV K1 mimics Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; in its ability to elicit signaling and to interact with &#x003bc; chains of BCR. However, unlike Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2;, which interact with &#x003bc; chains to direct the BCR complexes to the cell surface, K1 inhibits the intracellular transport of BCR complexes to the cell surface. Mutational analysis showed that although the K1/CD8-Tm chimera and K1 mutants dramatically downregulated BCR, their level of downregulation was slightly lower compared with wild-type K1. This may be because in the K1/CD8 chimera and K1 mutants the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 is not properly exposed to interact with the &#x003bc; chains. Nonetheless, our study provides evidence for a functional role of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 in recruitment of &#x003bc; chains of BCR.</p><p>Similar to Ig, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 contains conserved hypervariable and Ig homologous domains. Based on the predicted sequence, K1 is expected to be primarily present in the plasma membrane. However, to our surprise, most K1 was localized in the ER. Some of these distinctive domains at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of K1 may contribute to the ER localization and to the interaction with &#x003bc; chains of BCR. Further detailed study is needed to define the specific region of K1 required for these activities.</p><p>The downregulation of MHC class I and II molecules in virus-infected or transformed cells is a well-established phenomenon and often involves attenuation of transcription of the genes encoding the class I subunits <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R29">29</xref>. In addition, a postranslational mechanism of downregulation has been described and includes the production of proteins that mediate retention of newly synthesized class I molecules in the ER <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R29">29</xref>. Adenovirus E3 19K, human CMV US3, and mouse CMV m152 retain MHC class I heavy chain in the ER, preventing the maturation and intracellular transport of heavy chains to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R30">30</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R31">31</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R32">32</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R33">33</xref>. This activity has been shown to be mediated by interaction of these viral glycoproteins with the class I heavy chain. In a similar way, an interaction of K1 with &#x003bc; (heavy) chains retains BCR complexes in the ER, preventing the maturation and intracellular transport of BCR to the cell surface. In addition, several ER-resident proteins including calnexin, calreticulin, and Ig heavy chain binding protein have been shown to be important for the assembly and intracellular transport of multimeric protein complexes, including BCR <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R34">34</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R35">35</xref>. Interaction of K1 with &#x003bc; chains may affect activity of these ER-resident chaperons, which leads to accumulation of the BCR complexes in the ER. An investigation of the detailed molecular mechanisms of the ER retention of BCR by K1 is currently underway.</p><p>What are the advantages of BCR downregulation to the virus? BCR downregulation has already been demonstrated in several human cancers. For example, &#x0003e;80% of the cases of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the most common hematologic malignancy in adulthood, and a large number of AIDS-associated B cell lymphomas and mediastinal large B cell lymphomas have been shown to have dramatically decreased levels of BCR surface expression or diminished protein tyrosine kinase activity associated with BCR <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R36">36</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R37">37</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R38">38</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R39">39</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R40">40</xref>. In fact, KSHV-infected PEL cells that are of B cell origin have no detectable level of surface expression of BCR <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R41">41</xref>. These alterations have been shown to lead to nonresponsiveness to BCR signaling <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R42">42</xref>. Because engagement of the BCR initiates multiple intracellular signals that often lead to apoptosis, an inhibition of BCR-mediated signaling by the downregulation of its surface expression or reduction of BCR-associated protein tyrosine kinase activity may provide a long-term survival advantage in vivo. EBV latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) and KSHV K15 have also been shown to downregulate BCR function, but in a different way from K1 <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R43">43</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R44">44</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref>. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal ITAM of LMP2A and the COOH-terminal signaling modules of K15 interact with the B cell tyrosine kinases lyn and syk, and this interaction negatively modulates BCR signal transduction <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R43">43</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R44">44</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R46">46</xref>. In addition, a recent study with transgenic mice has demonstrated that LMP2A provides a constitutive survival signaling activity in primary B cells of transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R47">47</xref>. Thus, we hypothesize that the KSHV K1 may allow cell growth transformation to proceed by eliciting signals through its ITAM sequence, while at the same time preventing potential adverse effects that may be associated with apoptosis or untimely viral replication. In parallel with this hypothesis, K1 gene is expressed at low levels of latently infected PEL, whereas its expression is significantly induced during viral lytic life cycle <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref>. Thus, a detailed study of alterations of cellular signal transduction and intracellular transport by KSHV K1 will not only lead to a better understanding of viral persistence and pathogenesis, but will also provide a novel means for investigating cellular regulatory systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We especially thank Drs.

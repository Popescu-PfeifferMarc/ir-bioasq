Contraction of the activated CD4 T cell population in wild-type mice was associated with increased apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells. In BCG-infected interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; knockout (KO) mice, the activated CD4 T cell population did not undergo apoptosis.

The majority of these cells are eliminated by apoptosis to restore the T cell compartment to homeostasis <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref>. Three major pathways for terminating immune responses have been identified (for review see reference 2). Fas&#x02013;Fas ligand (FasL) interactions mediate activation-induced cell death. CTLA-4 expression on T cells inhibits the proliferation of activated T cells. IL-2 promotes activation and then apoptosis of T cells. Mice lacking Fas, FasL, CTLA-4, IL-2, or IL-2R accumulate activated T cells and are susceptible to autoimmune disease <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref>. However, it is not clear whether these molecules play crucial roles in terminating normal immune responses, as the T cell population in Fas- and CTLA-4&#x02013;deficient mice shows normal expansion and contraction after in vivo antigen stimulation <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>. It is important to fully understand the mechanisms by which effector cells are eliminated after an immune response. Mechanisms for terminating immune responses may affect the generation of protective memory T cells and may eliminate potentially harmful activated T cells.</p><p>In an earlier study, IFN-&#x003b3; was postulated to play a critical role in death of effector CD4 T cells as a possible mechanism for self-tolerance <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref>. However, this work was done entirely in vitro with a cloned T cell line. No in vivo evidence for such a role for IFN-&#x003b3; was presented. IFN-&#x003b3; has an essential role in stimulating macrophages to produce nitric oxide (NO) <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>. Macrophages restrict the expansion of splenocytes in vitro to various stimuli by making NO <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>. NO is an inducer of apoptosis in a variety of cell types, including T cell clones <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref>. However, it is evident from numerous recent reviews of T cell downregulation that IFN-&#x003b3; and NO are not widely considered to have a role in T cell downregulation and homeostasis <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref>. This may be because there is no clear in vivo evidence that activated CD4 T cells fail to undergo apoptosis and therefore accumulate in mice lacking IFN-&#x003b3;.</p><p>We observed that during Bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) infection of IFN-&#x003b3; knockout (KO) mice, the CD4 T cell population expanded markedly to comprise 30&#x02013;50% of total lymphocytes in the spleen and liver. Our investigation of this phenomenon led to novel evidence that IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice fail to induce apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells during BCG infection, resulting in accumulation of activated CD4 T cells. We also found that IFN-&#x003b3; induces apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells in vitro during BCG infection and that activated macrophages and NO are a part of the mechanism. Thus, IFN-&#x003b3; is an essential component of a mechanism for terminating immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Infection of Mice.</title><p>Homozygous IFN-&#x003b3; KO breeding pairs, backcrossed for 10 generations onto C57BL/6, were set up to generate IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R16">16</xref>.

This resulted in 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU in the spleens at the time of infection. At 3 wk of BCG infection, wild-type spleens had an average of 3.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> CFU, and IFN-&#x003b3; KO spleens had an average of 2.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> CFU. These organisms were not rapidly cleared in the wild-type mice, persisting at 1&#x02013;3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU in the spleen for 8 wk. In IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice, the BCG organisms grew in an uncontrolled manner due to an impairment of macrophage activation in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R16">16</xref>.</p><p>We monitored the number of activated CD4 T cells in the spleens of mice during BCG infection using CD44<sup>hi</sup> as a marker for activation. When naive cells encounter antigen and are activated to become effectors, there is a stable upregulation of CD44 on the cell surface of effectors <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>. After week 3 of BCG infection, the CD4 T cell population in the spleens of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice was highly skewed toward high levels of expression of CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> A). The CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells expressed low levels of CD62L and CD45RB, consistent with an activated phenotype <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref>.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> B shows the kinetics of accumulation of splenic CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells during BCG infection. The wild-type mice showed an &#x0223c;10-fold expansion of the activated CD4 T cell population at 3.5 wk of infection. This was followed by a rapid contraction of the population 1 wk later. In the IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice, the activated CD4 T cell population expanded by 27-fold at 3.5 wk of infection. This population did not contract but accumulated to large numbers in the spleen for several weeks. A sharp decline in the number of activated CD4 T cells occurred at 8 wk of BCG infection in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice; this coincided with cell death in the necrotic spleen. Thus, the apparent deletion of activated CD4 T cells in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice was most likely a consequence of nonspecific cell death. Furthermore, the CD4 T cell population became increasingly skewed toward high levels of CD44 expression during the course of infection rather than returning to the homeostasis level of 25% CD44<sup>hi</sup>, as observed in BCG-infected wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> C). There was no change in the number of naive CD4 T cells or CD8 T cells in the spleens of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice during BCG infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased CD4 T Cell Responsiveness to Mycobacterial Antigens in IFN-&#x003b3; KO Mice.</title><p>A large expansion of the CD4<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cell population was never seen in uninfected IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice but occurred only in response to BCG infection. We investigated whether this large population of activated CD4 T cells in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice was responsive to mycobacterial antigens. Enriched CD4 T cells from IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice showed greatly increased proliferation, incorporating four to six times more [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine in response to both PPD and Ag 85 compared with CD4 T cells from wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Wild-type and IFN-&#x003b3; KO CD4 T cells proliferated equally well to the T cell mitogen Con A (not shown), and both failed to proliferate to an irrelevant antigen, OVA. These data and the increased CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cell numbers suggest that there were increased numbers of mycobacterial antigen&#x02013;specific CD4 T cells in the spleens of BCG-infected IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice compared with BCG-infected wild-type mice. This is consistent with a failure to delete antigen-specific CD4 T cells during the immune response to BCG in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Activated CD4 T Cells Underwent Increased Apoptosis in Wild-Type but not IFN-&#x003b3; KO Mice.</title><p>We considered the possibility that the failure of the activated CD4 T cell population to contract in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice might reflect a failure of these cells to undergo apoptosis. We measured apoptosis of activated splenic CD4 T cells during BCG infection with a quantitative flow cytometry assay that uses annexin V&#x02013;FITC <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref>. The activated CD4 T cell population in BCG-infected wild-type mice typically had more than twice as many cells in early apoptosis as the same population in BCG-infected IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A).</p><p>We measured the kinetics of apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells during BCG infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B). On day 17 of BCG infection, apoptosis of the activated CD4 T cell population in wild-type mice increased dramatically to 45&#x02013;50%, remaining high for at least 8 wk. The activated CD4 T cell population of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice did not show any increase in apoptosis over baseline levels during BCG infection. These data indicate that IFN-&#x003b3; is required, either directly or indirectly, for upregulating apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells during BCG infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Fas Was Not Required for Upregulation of Apoptosis of Activated CD4 T Cells.</title><p>We investigated whether Fas was involved in this IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;dependent pathway of apoptosis. We infected wild-type, IFN-&#x003b3; KO, and Fas-deficient <italic>lpr/lpr</italic> mice with BCG and monitored the kinetics of apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells. Interestingly, the <italic>lpr/lpr</italic> mice behaved identically to wild-type mice, exhibiting a surge of apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells on day 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> C). Apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice was significantly lower than that observed in <italic>lpr/lpr</italic> and wild-type mice on days 17 and 28 after BCG infection. Thus, increased apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells during BCG infection required IFN-&#x003b3; but did not require Fas.</p></sec><sec><title>IFN-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> Induced Apoptosis of Activated CD4 T Cells In Vitro.</title><p>We investigated whether adding exogenous IFN-&#x003b3; to spleen cells from BCG-infected IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice could induce apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Addition of IFN-&#x003b3; to cultures of BCG-infected IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice induced significantly increased apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells as early as 22 h, increased at 45 h, but was most dramatic at 65 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). We obtained similar results measuring apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells by decreased forward and increased side light scatter <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R22">22</xref> and by using the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling) assay for apoptosis (data not shown).</p><p>During the 65 h of culture, wild-type activated CD4 T cells showed greater apoptosis and death than the same cells in IFN-&#x003b3; KO cultures (compare wild-type versus IFN-&#x003b3; KO cultures in medium, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In wild-type cultures, addition of IFN-&#x003b3; did not significantly increase apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These wild-type CD4 T cells may be programmed to die during the culture period by signals they received in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Activated Macrophages Were Required for IFN-&#x003b3; to Induce Apoptosis of Activated CD4 T Cells.</title><p>IFN-&#x003b3; did not kill highly enriched CD4 T cells but did kill CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells in whole spleen cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A), suggesting that the effect of IFN-&#x003b3; was indirect. Mac-1 or CD11b is expressed at high levels on differentiated macrophages <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref>. In Mac-1&#x02013;depleted cultures, addition of IFN-&#x003b3; did not kill activated CD4 T cells. Similarly, depletion of adherent cells greatly decreased the cytotoxic effects of IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). Adherent peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) from wild-type BCG-infected mice are highly enriched in activated macrophages and have been shown to have cytotoxic effects in vitro on tumor cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref>. We cultured wild-type PECs with purified IFN-&#x003b3; KO CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). As the wild-type PECs had most likely been exposed to IFN-&#x003b3; in vivo, they reduced the viability of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells even without addition of IFN-&#x003b3;. However, wild-type PECs killed significantly more IFN-&#x003b3; KO CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells with exogenously added IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A).</p></sec><sec><title>NO Production Was Required for IFN-&#x003b3; to Induce Apoptosis of Activated CD4 T Cells.</title><p>We tested the effect of LMNA, an NO synthase enzyme inhibitor, on IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells. Addition of LMNA to wild-type cultures resulted in significantly increased percentages of live CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD4 T cells compared with cultures with medium only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B). Addition of LMNA along with IFN-&#x003b3; to IFN-&#x003b3; KO cultures abolished IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> C). Similar results were obtained using another NO inhibitor, <italic>N</italic>
<sup>6</sup>-(1-iminoethyl)-dihydrochloride (data not shown). These data suggest that at least part of the killing of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells in IFN-&#x003b3; KO cultures by IFN-&#x003b3; is mediated by NO.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We propose that a negative feedback loop maintains CD4 T cell homeostasis. During BCG infection, CD4 T cells secrete IFN-&#x003b3; and activate macrophages to increased microbicidal activity. Activated macrophages generate NO and other effector molecules, such as superoxide, that enable them to kill the BCG organisms. In the presence of activated macrophages, the CD4 T cells begin to undergo increased apoptosis, returning the number of activated CD4 T cells to normal levels. Therefore, activated CD4 T cells secreting IFN-&#x003b3; indirectly trigger their own apoptosis by activating macrophages. As IFN-&#x003b3; is uniquely required for macrophage activation, IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice are expected to be lacking other macrophage effector molecules besides NO. Whether other macrophage effector mechanisms are involved is currently under investigation.</p><p>Naive 6&#x02013;10-wk-old IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice do not spontaneously accumulate activated CD4 T cells in the absence of BCG infection or an antigenic challenge. This suggests that IFN-&#x003b3; is involved in regulating CD4 T cell homeostasis only during immune responses. In contrast, mice lacking CTLA-4, IL-2, and the common cytokine &#x003b3; chain receptor spontaneously accumulate activated CD4 T cells without apparent infection <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R25">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R26">26</xref>. Thus, the IFN-&#x003b3; KO mouse has a novel phenotype that provides insight into the regulation of the immune response.</p><p>Several recent studies provide supporting evidence for a role of IFN-&#x003b3; in apoptosis of immune cells during other infectious diseases. During infection of mice with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, neutralization of IFN-&#x003b3; with antibody resulted in decreased apoptosis in tissue sections of Peyer's patch lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R27">27</xref>. This was associated with decreased Fas expression. In contrast, we showed that mice lacking Fas upregulated apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells during BCG infection identically to wild-type mice. In another study, IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice infected with <italic>Trypanosome cruzi</italic> showed decreased apoptosis of whole splenocytes <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R28">28</xref>. However, neither study specifically addressed the role of IFN-&#x003b3; in apoptosis of CD4 T cells, nor did they demonstrate increased accumulation of activated CD4 T cells in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;. Mice lacking inducible NO synthase showed increased numbers of CD4 T cells after infection with <italic>Trypanosome brucei</italic>. However, the level of apoptosis of these CD4 T cells was not measured <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R29">29</xref>.</p><p>We considered the possibility that the IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice accumulated activated CD4 T cells only because of the large difference in bacterial burden between wild-type and IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice. However, for several reasons we think it is more likely that the principal cause for accumulation of activated CD4 T cells was the failure to induce apoptosis of these cells in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;. First, BCG proved to be a very persistent pathogen in both wild-type and IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice. The bacterial burden in wild-type spleens did not fall below the initiating number of &#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> CFU during the entire 8 wk of BCG infection. However, elimination of the activated CD4 T cells in wild-type spleens occurred well before the bacteria were cleared. Second, the peak numbers of activated CD4 T cells were at 3 wk of infection in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice; at this time, the bacterial burden was only sixfold greater than in wild-type mice. Third, in the an accompanying article in this issue by Chu et al., we show that activated CD4 T cells fail to undergo apoptosis and accumulate in large numbers in the spleen and central nervous system of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R30">30</xref>. This is an immune response to a persisting, but noninfectious, antigen. Taken together, these data strongly argue that IFN-&#x003b3; is required to eliminate activated CD4 T cells by apoptosis during both infectious and autoimmune disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R29 AI41258-02 and by Trudeau Institute grant IHP-85.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="R1"><element-citation publication-type="journal">

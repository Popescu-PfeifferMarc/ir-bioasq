We have investigated the consequences of exposure to this prototypic B cell superantigen, and found that treatment of neonates or adults induces a T cell&#x02013;independent deletion of a large supraclonal set of susceptible B cells that includes clan III/V<sub>H</sub> S107 family&#x02013;expressing lymphocytes. In studies of different SpA forms, the magnitude of the induced deletion directly correlated with the V<sub>H</sub>-specific binding affinity/avidity. Upon cessation of SpA exposure, the representation of conventional splenic (B-2 subset) lymphocytes normalized; however, we found that the V<sub>H</sub> family&#x02013;restricted deficit of peritoneal B-1 cells persisted. SpA treatment also induced a persistent loss of splenic S107-&#x003bc; transcripts, with a loss of certain natural antibodies and specific tolerance to phosphorylcholine immunogens that normally recruit protective antimicrobial responses dominated by the S107-expressing B-1 clone, T15. These studies illustrate how a B cell superantigen can exploit a primordial Achilles heel in the immune system, for which B-1 cells, an important source of natural antibodies and host immune responses, have special susceptibility.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tolerance</kwd><kwd>repertoire</kwd><kwd>clonal selection</kwd><kwd>immunoglobulin genes</kwd><kwd>host immunity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Superantigens (SAgs) are products of microbial pathogens that have the capacity to adversely affect immune responsiveness by interactions with highly represented conserved sites in the V regions of the antigen receptors of host lymphocytes. These proteins have been studied to elucidate their possible roles in pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and these nonimmune binding interactions have also provided an invaluable window into the signaling, cytokine, and cognate parameters of T lymphocyte antigen receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation. Analogous in vitro interactions of several naturally occurring proteins with B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) have also been described (for a review, see reference 1); however the implications for in vivo exposure to a B cell SAg are largely unexplored.</p><p>Of all putative B cell SAgs, protein A of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (SpA) has been the best characterized. Despite the fact that this 42-kD secreted membrane protein does not appear to play an essential role in the metabolism or survival of the bacterium, SpA is produced by most (or all) clinical isolates <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>. Consequently, it has been postulated that the highly refined Ig binding properties of SpA evolved to play a role in the host&#x02013;pathogen relationship. Staphylococcal virulence has been shown to be enhanced by SpA in experimental models <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref> but the responsible pathophysiologic mechanism(s) have not been determined.</p><p>The immunomodulatory activities of SpA are likely aided by its oligovalent organization. It is composed of five 56&#x02013;61-amino acid homologous extramembrane domains in tandem <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>, and each domain possesses both the well-known Fc&#x003b3; binding specificity and a separate binding site that is specific for Fab-containing V<sub>H</sub> regions from the structurally related clan III families <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref>. Furthermore, in vitro stimulation with <italic>S. aureus</italic> has been reported to preferentially select for human B cells expressing genes from the V<sub>H</sub>3 family <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>.</p><p>The special molecular features of the Fab-binding specificity of SpA, which were first identified in correlation with antibody sequence usage <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>, have recently been elucidated in crystallographic analyses of a human IgM Fab&#x02013;SpA domain cocomplex. This interaction was shown to be mediated by a clan III&#x02013;restricted surface, distant from the CDR loops responsible for the recognition of conventional antigens <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>, which involves 13 contact residues in the V<sub>H</sub> framework (FR)1 and FR3 subdomains that have been conserved during the evolution of the adaptive immune system <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>. As a direct consequence, this unconventional type of V<sub>H</sub>-restricted BCR-mediated binding activity is highly represented in immune systems of diverse mammalian species, including the human system in which the V<sub>H</sub>3 family of clan III composes nearly half of all inherited V<sub>H</sub> genes. It is also prevalent in amphibian and avian species that have been studied <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>. In the mouse, the homologous clan III families S107, J606, 7183, and DNA4 commonly convey this binding activity although the affinities of these interactions vary <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>.</p><p>In a recent report, we showed that &#x0003e;5% of mature B cells in naive BALB/c mice possess this nonimmune binding activity, and it is also displayed by &#x0223c;12% of constitutively IgM-secreting splenic cells and a comparable proportion of circulating natural IgM <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref>. Most importantly, we found that neonatal exposure to a chemically modified form of SpA that is devoid of Fc-binding activity induced an acute loss of &#x0003e;80% of SpA-reactive splenic B cells. Although this cellular representation in the spleen later normalized, there was still a long-lasting loss of SpA-reactive IgM-secreting cells (ISCs) and an equivalent loss of circulating SpA-reactive IgM, which persisted, despite the presence of SpA-specific T cells, when evaluated &#x0003e;1 yr later <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref>. However, these studies did not identify which B cells are susceptible to SAg-mediated deletion, and the implications for host immune responsiveness were not further considered.</p><p>We have now investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the immunomodulatory activities of this model B cell SAg. To determine the functional features responsible for its immunological properties, we have compared the host's response to native SpA to treatment with several forms of SpA that vary in their Fc- and Fab-binding activities. Within these studies, we have also identified the V<sub>H</sub>-defined supraclonal B cell set most affected by treatment. Moreover, we found that SpA exposure adversely affected the levels of certain natural antibodies and caused a selective tolerance to immunogens important for host defense against many bacterial as well as protozoan, fungal, and nematode pathogens <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R16">16</xref>. Based on these findings, we present a model explaining how this microbial toxin can cause an immunosuppression in the host B cell compartment based on V<sub>H</sub> usage, and discuss why B-1 cells are especially susceptible to the induction of long-lasting effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mutagenesis and Cloning of Domain D&#x02032; Derivatives.</title><p>To create novel recombinant forms of SpA, the L17D and I31A mutations <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref> were introduced into the gene for domain D (DD&#x02032;) of SpA in the pDomD&#x02032; plasmid <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>, and termed mDomD&#x02032;.

Notably, a total dose of only 50 &#x003bc;g of MSpA often induced a similar level of suppression, but the responses of mice within this treatment group were more heterogeneous (not shown). Hence, the level of supraclonal suppression of SAg-reactive ISCs directly correlated with the relative Fab-binding affinity and not the Fc-binding activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Adult Mice Are Also Susceptible to SAg-induced Immunosuppression.</title><p>To ascertain whether adult mice are also affected by SpA treatment, 7-wk-old BALB/c mice were given proportionately larger doses and evaluated 1 mo later.

<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R26">26</xref>. Akin to the control C57BL/6 groups, neonatal treatment of T cell&#x02013;deficient mice with a protein antigen also resulted in increased overall levels of splenic ISCs, while these mice were also susceptible to SpA-induced selective decreases in the frequency and relative representation of SAg-reactive ISCs in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> E) and bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> F). Compared with control groups, SpA treatment reduced by 35% the proportion of clan III&#x02013;expressing splenic ISCs (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> E), identified by a broadly reactive clan III Ig&#x02013;specific marker (LJ-26 antibody) <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>. The T15 B cell clonal set represents only a small component of V<sub>H</sub> clan III/S107&#x02013;expressing cells, and using a V<sub>H</sub>T15-specific marker (Tc68) we found that in these treated mice the representation among ISCs of these products was reduced by 76% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0002) in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> E) and by 82% in bone marrow (<italic>P</italic> = 0.026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> F). Compared with control groups, levels of circulating natural Ig-bearing T15-specific idiotypic markers, which included IgM, IgG2b, and IgG3 responses, were each found to be significantly reduced (not shown). These results document that SpA-induced suppression is mediated via a B cell&#x02013;targeted mechanism affecting certain S107-expressing B cells, which is not dependent on T cell influences.</p></sec><sec><title>SAg Induces a Selective V<sub>H</sub> Family&#x02013;targeted Deficit in the Expressed Ig Repertoire.</title><p>To ascertain whether these defects in SAg-reactive ISCs and circulating IgM reflect losses restricted to V<sub>H</sub> family&#x02013;defined supraclonal B cell sets, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR/Southern blots were performed. Compared with naive age-matched mice, akin to the finding of increased IgM levels, we found that treatment with a control protein induced a nonspecific increase in transcript expression of &#x003bc; rearrangements of each of seven different V<sub>H</sub> families studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). Significantly, MSpA or SpA treatment induced a selective expression deficit of only the clan III/S107 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). A similar selective suppression of V<sub>H</sub> S107 transcript expression was also documented after SpA treatment of adult mice (not shown).</p><p>To quantitate the deficit, we used a real-time PCR&#x02013;based assay system, which demonstrated that neonatal treatment with MSpA or SpA significantly reduced splenic S107-&#x003bc; transcript expression levels by a mean 97.7 and 98.6% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) compared with control age-matched mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B). Notably, in many of these SAg-treated mice, S107 transcript levels were actually orders of magnitude lower than the groups' mean values, indicating much greater levels of suppression. Furthermore, for mice treated as adults and evaluated 1 mo later, SpA exposure also induced a mean 90% reduction in S107-&#x003bc; transcript expression (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In addition, after treatment with MSpA, five of seven mice displayed &#x0003e;90% reductions of S107-&#x003bc; transcript expression (not shown). Hence, in vivo exposure to SpA targets a supraclonal B cell set, resulting in a nearly complete loss of S107 transcript expression that appears to be linked to the selective loss of certain clan III&#x02013;constitutive antibody-forming cells that are a source of natural antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>SAg Exposure Alters the Natural Antibody Repertoire and Induces Tolerance to PC.</title><p>To evaluate the consequences of SAg exposure on natural antibodies of defined clonal origin, we measured the levels of antibodies to PC, an immunodominant moiety present in many microbial pathogens <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R16">16</xref>. In many murine strains, antibodies to PC predominantly derive from T15 B cells that employ a specific pairing of canonical V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub> rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R27">27</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Notably, these T15 clones are represented at high frequency in the B-1 pool without prior immune exposure even in germ-free mice <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R28">28</xref>, and provide defense from systemic infection from virulent pneumococci <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R29">29</xref> and <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R30">30</xref>. Only higher avidity Fab-binding forms (e.g., MSpA or SpA) inhibited levels of PC-specific natural antibodies, including those from the T15 clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). In contrast, levels of natural antibodies to &#x003b1;1&#x02013;3 dextran, which arise from a separate B-1 clonal set expressing a defined clan I/J558 rearrangement, were increased in each of the treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> B), reflecting the nonspecific increase of total circulating IgM (not shown). Hence, SpA exposure selectively suppressed a V<sub>H</sub>-targeted set of antigen-specific natural antibodies.</p><p>To assess the impact of SAg exposure on the immune competence of the host, mice in different neonatal treatment groups were challenged with dextran and PC immunogens that induce TI-2 responses. Compared with the vigorous responses in naive or control protein-treated groups, all of the mice neonatally treated with MSpA or SpA were tolerant to challenge with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> extract, whereas the mice treated with the domain D&#x02032; monomer of SpA displayed highly heterogeneous anti-PC responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A). In other challenged groups, mice treated as neonates with SpA were also nonresponsive to the PC-containing purified C-PS TI-2 immunogen (not shown), and were also tolerant to the T cell&#x02013;dependent PC immunogen PC-KLH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B) that also recruits a response dominated by T15 B cell clone(s) <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R31">31</xref>. Treatment of adult mice with SpA induced the same selective tolerance to the PC-containing pneumococcal immunogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> C). Therefore, SAg treatment induces tolerance in an antigen-specific response requiring clan III/S107&#x02013;expressing B cell clonal sets; in the absence of this response, other clonal sets are not recruited into this response, whereas a response requiring an clan I/J558&#x02013;expressing B cells is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SpA Induces a Loss of Detectable Clan III&#x02013;expressing B-1 Cells in the Peritoneal Cavity.</title><p>To consider the cellular mechanisms responsible for SpA-induced defects, we have evaluated T15i transgenic &#x0201c;knockin&#x0201d; mice that have B cells expressing the canonical T15/S107 V<sub>H</sub> rearrangement. In heterozygotic mice, clonal representation of B cells can be readily tracked, as B cells expressing endogenous V<sub>H</sub> regions bear the IgM<sup>b</sup> allotype, whereas expression of the V<sub>H</sub>T15 transgene is linked to the IgM<sup>a</sup> allotype. Confirming their earlier characterization <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R32">32</xref>, in these mice most peritoneal V<sub>H</sub>T15-expressing B cells, which coexpress diverse endogenous L chains, bear the phenotype of B-1b cells (i.e., B220<sup>low</sup>IgD<sup>low</sup>Mac-1<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). Clarifying our previously reported findings in BALB/c mice, 1 d after completion of neonatal SpA treatment, heterozygous mice exhibited a &#x0003e;90% reduction of V<sub>H</sub>T15 transgene&#x02013;expressing splenic B cells (not shown). Furthermore, treatment of adult 6-wk-old mice with a single 0.5-mg dose of SpA also induced an acute selective loss of &#x0003e;60% of V<sub>H</sub>T15-expressing splenic and peritoneal B cells when evaluated 1 d later (not shown).</p><p>To evaluate the clonal representation associated with long-lasting functional defects, we studied T15i heterozygous mice months after the last SpA exposure. At these late time points, there were no major differences in the representation of transgene-expressing splenic conventional B cells (IgD<sup>hi</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> B), presumably because these B cells are continually replenished from the bone marrow. However, in the peritoneal cavity, a major anatomic residence of B-1 cells, neonatal SpA treatment resulted in a highly significant mean 78% reduction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0006) in the frequency of V<sub>H</sub>T15 transgene&#x02013;expressing peritoneal B-1 cells (Mac-1<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>) (7.9 &#x000b1; 1.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 7) compared with control treated mice (36.5 &#x000b1; 3.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> A). Using the clan III (LJ-26) marker, comparable losses of transgene-expressing B-1 cell populations were also demonstrated in the peritoneum but not the spleen (not shown). We also demonstrated similar findings in studies of adult TCR-deficient mice with polyclonal endogenous B cell populations. In the T cell&#x02013;deficient mice that had received neonatal SpA treatment, the representation of clan III&#x02013;expressing peritoneal B-1a (LJ-26<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>low</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>+</sup>) cells was significantly reduced (8.1 &#x000b1; 0.49%, <italic>n</italic> = 4, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.016), representing a mean 30% reduction, compared with naive (11.5 &#x000b1; 0.36%) or control treated mice (10.3 &#x000b1; 0.52%). Similar significant losses were also demonstrated in the clan III&#x02013;expressing B-1b (LJ-26<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>low</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) cells of SpA-treated mice (6.8 &#x000b1; 0.48%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.015) compared with naive (9.7 &#x000b1; 0.14%) and control treated mice (9.75 &#x000b1; 0.65%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> C). In contrast, the representation of conventional splenic B cells in these mice was not significantly affected (not shown). These findings demonstrate that a limited interval of exposure to SpA can induce a long-lasting clonal loss of clan III/S107&#x02013;expressing peritoneal B-1 cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have demonstrated that in vivo exposure to staphylococcal protein A, a model B cell SAg, results in a selective targeting and immunosuppression of a supraclonal set of B lymphocytes that express V<sub>H</sub> clan III antibody genes, and both neonatal and mature mice are susceptible. In general, the magnitude of the induced B cell defect correlated with the relative avidity of Fab-binding interaction of the SAg. While the structural basis of this SAg&#x02013;BCR interaction is no doubt distinct from those associated with binding of conventional antigens, these findings are consistent with earlier observations in which high affinity ligands are most effective at inducing B cell tolerance in classical models <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R33">33</xref> and in transgenic Ig models <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R34">34</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R35">35</xref>.</p><p>In surveys of the murine antibodies, many genes from clan III&#x02013;related V<sub>H</sub> families commonly encode for binding of this prototypic bacterial B cell SAg <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>, but certain of these genes, especially those from the S107 family, generally encode for antibodies with greater SpA binding activity <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>. These findings parallel data from earlier studies of phage-display antibody libraries, in which SpA preferentially selected for phagemid clones expressing certain human germline V<sub>H</sub>3 genes that conveyed greater SpA binding activity <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>. In the current studies, we have now demonstrated that in vivo exposure to SpA can induce a nearly complete loss of constitutively expressed splenic S107-&#x003bc; transcripts and natural IgM, including anti-PC antibodies. In view of the cumulative data, we can only interpret the loss of these S107-expressing B cell clones as due, at least in part, to their higher binding affinity for SpA.</p><p>The susceptibility of T cell&#x02013;deficient mice to SAg-induced immune defects indicates that this process, which is associated with long-lasting clonal loss, does not have an obligatory T cell dependence. In fact, induced PC-specific tolerance persists in the presence of SpA-specific T cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref>. Hence, SAg-induced tolerance has features that appear distinct from experimental models of B cell tolerance in which the unavailability of antigen-specific T cells is a primary determinant in whether B cell interactions with nominal antigen result in clonal anergy and/or deletion <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R36">36</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R37">37</xref>.</p><p>The capacity to induce a persistent &#x0201c;hole&#x0201d; in the B cell repertoire is not unique to SpA, as similar outcomes have also been previously reported upon treatment with certain specific B cell ligands/antigens, or with antiidiotypic antibodies that act as their surrogates <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R38">38</xref>. However, we know that in naive mice, PC-specific antibody-forming cells normally represent only an estimated 1/50,000 splenocytes <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R39">39</xref>, indicating that PC-specific B cells represent only a limited component of the large supraclonal set affected by SAg exposure. Hence, the distinction of the SpA response derives in part from the much larger scale of the induced supraclonal defect. In addition, the immunological properties of SpA are also special, as this naturally occurring &#x0201c;tolerizing agent&#x0201d; affects host responses to other immunogens by virtue of its ability to interact with supraclonal sets via V<sub>H</sub> family&#x02013;specific interactions (i.e., it has superantigenic properties).</p><p>Our earlier surveys identified two distinct temporal phases in BALB/c mice during the response to neonatal treatment with this B cell SAg. Throughout both early and late phases, suppression of levels of SAg-reactive IgM was a consistent finding <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref>, whereas the late phase response, beginning at &#x0223c;6 wk of life, was distinguished by the acquisition of SpA-specific T cell responsiveness and the induction of SAg-specific IgG1 antibody production. In the current studies, T cell&#x02013;deficient mice were also found to be sensitive to the induced B cell supraclonal suppression, but the features characteristic of the late phase of the response were absent in these mice. This late phase T cell&#x02013;dependent response likely involves conventional (B-2) lymphocytes in germinal center&#x02013;type reactions in secondary lymphoid tissue that elaborate clonally focussed MSpA-reactive IgG1 antibody responses (Silverman, G.J., manuscript in preparation). Therefore, because these IgG1 responses from conventional B cells can reconstitute in BALB/c mice, our data indicate that it is the effects of this bacterial toxin on a separate B cell pool that is responsible for the persistent induced defects in anti-PC responses and natural antibody production.</p><p>Several compelling pieces of evidence implicate the targeting of clones within the B-1 pool as the origin of the long-lasting immunological defects. Most relevant, B-1 cells are believed to be the source of constitutively produced natural IgM antibodies that provide the primary defense against many common microbial pathogens <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R40">40</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R41">41</xref>. Moreover, the susceptible set includes T15 B cells, the source of S107-encoded anti-PC antibodies that dominate these natural IgM and postimmunization protective responses, which adoptive transfer studies have rigorously demonstrated reside predominantly, if not solely, within the B-1 pool <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R42">42</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R43">43</xref>. We found that SAg exposure resulted in a near complete loss of splenic S107-&#x003bc; transcripts, but these findings, from RNA-based assays, are greatly influenced by the representation of antibody-forming cells that contain 100&#x02013;1,000-fold greater amounts of antibody-specific transcripts than resting B cells. Hence, the dramatic reductions in S107-&#x003bc; transcript levels undoubtedly reflect the loss of an SAg-reactive set of constitutive ISCs that derive from B-1 cells to produce natural antibodies.</p><p>The special immunobiology of B-1 cells explains their susceptibility to the persistent V<sub>H</sub>-targeted effects of SpA. For the developing murine B-1 pool, entry of newly generated lymphocytes is reportedly complete by the end of the neonatal period, and thereafter these B cells are self-sustaining and cannot be replenished by the lymphoneogenesis that perpetually supplements the conventional (B-2) compartment in the adult <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R44">44</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R45">45</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R46">46</xref>. Also relevant, compared with splenic follicular B cells, adult peritoneal B-1 cells are poor responders to in vitro stimulation with anti-IgM, an experimental surrogate for a BCR signal. In fact, BCR-mediated apoptosis is a common outcome of high level antigenic stimulation of these extrafollicular cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R47">47</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R48">48</xref>. Strong in vivo cross-linking of cell surface Igs has also been reported to induce apoptotic death of mature B cells in the peritoneal cavity <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R48">48</xref>. Presumably, these features of B-1 cells are also responsible for the persistent clonal loss that results from instillation of IgM allotype&#x02013;specific antibody into allotype heterozygotic mice <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R49">49</xref>. Based on these observations, it is predictable that even a limited exposure to a potent natural BCR-targeted agent would induce a supraclonal hole in the B-1 repertoire that would persist, likely indefinitely. In earlier studies, we demonstrated a transient supraclonal deletion in the spleen and bone marrow immediately after SAg treatment <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref>; however, the clonal representation at these sites later normalized, presumably because of replenishment of conventional B cells from the central compartment. Consistent with this hypothesis, in surveys of splenic V<sub>H</sub>-&#x003b4; rearrangements that are representative of mature naive conventional follicular B cells (i.e., sIgD<sup>hi</sup>), we did not detect a lasting SAg-induced supraclonal defect (Silverman, G.J., manuscript in preparation). These findings contrast with the persistent loss of V<sub>H</sub>S107-&#x003bc; transcripts characterized in the current studies, which correlates with the supraclonal loss of splenic constitutive ISCs that have been linked to the B-1 pool. Hence, we believe that the lasting SpA-induced loss of SAg-reactive clan III&#x02013;derived peritoneal B-1 cells reflects their special vulnerability for the induction of persistent clonal defects by this bacterial Fab-binding protein.</p><p>B-1 cells are associated with a distinct repertoire that includes well-defined clonal sets that produce natural antibodies responsible for housekeeping and antimicrobial functions. From lessons first appreciated for the T15 clone, it appears that the binding specificities of B-1 cells commonly derive from canonical antibody gene rearrangements formed in primary sequence-directed splicing events <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R50">50</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R51">51</xref> and are subsequently subject to ligand-mediated clonal selection <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R52">52</xref>; hence, B-1 cells have been postulated to convey a repertoire naturally selected during the evolution of the adaptive immune system <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R53">53</xref>. From this viewpoint, targeting of host clan III B cells, especially those providing natural immune defenses <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R29">29</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R41">41</xref>, may provide a great advantage to a pathogen. Clan III genes are expressed in the immune systems of phylogenetically distant species as far back as elasmobranchs, and in certain species these antibody genes are the earliest expressed during development <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref>. In particular, clan III V<sub>H</sub> families and SpA-binding activity are highly represented in mammalian immune systems <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>, and in humans &#x0003e;30% of B cells are targeted by SpA <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>. Moreover, the current findings, which elucidate the immunological properties of SpA, should also help us to understand the effects of other postulated B cell SAgs <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R54">54</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R55">55</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R56">56</xref>. In particular, our findings may provide insight into how the SAg properties of HIV-1&#x02013;associated retroviral products may contribute to a predisposition to certain infections <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R57">57</xref>, especially the otherwise inexplicably high frequency of pneumococcal sepsis <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R58">58</xref>.</p><p>In summary, our findings indicate that staphylococci produce a toxin that can impair host defenses through effects on B lymphocytes, for which B-1 cells have special vulnerability. These interactions are mediated by an unconventional binding site on clan III&#x02013;associated V<sub>H</sub> region framework subdomains that have been highly conserved in evolution <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>. From these findings, we speculate that this common pathogen has developed a toxin with B cell SAg properties to exploit a primordial Achilles heel in the immune system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the kind gift from Dr. Klaus Rajewsky of T15i transgenic mice, which were kindly transferred to us by Drs.

Postimmune responses were measured 10 d after challenge of 3-mo-old mice (A) with pronase-treated extract of R36A pneumococcal bacteria and B1355 dextran in CFA, and (B) with PC-KLH emulsified in CFA. (C) Adult BALB/c mice were treated with SpA, and then challenged 7 d later. Detection of anti-PC responses used the T15 clone&#x02013;specific AB1-2 antibody, which recognizes an idiotope requiring coexpression of both the T15 V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> regions (reference 21), and also the clan III&#x02013;restricted avian mAb, LJ-26 (reference 12). Groups are indicated by the protein with which they were conditioned and subsequently challenged, with comparison to control groups of naive mice challenged with R36A and dextran in CFA (Naive/R36A Dex), and to naive mice that received CFA alone (Naive/CFA).

In each multigroup study, naive, SpA- or control protein-treated mice were included, with comparisons to naive BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Mice were treated as neonates, and then evaluated 7&#x02013;21 wk later in microfluorimetric assays. Representative results from studies of T15i mice (A) peritoneal cavity and (B) splenic mononuclear cells are displayed. For these analyses, gates were set so that &#x0003c;0.8% of C57BL/6 (IgM<sup>b</sup>)B220<sup>+</sup> cells were reactive with the IgM<sup>a</sup>-specific reagent. Representative results are shown from the (C) peritoneal cells of matched groups of TCR-&#x003b2;<sup>2/2</sup>&#x003b4;<sup>2/2</sup> mice, evaluated 16 wk after the last exposure. In these results, control mice were treated with HEL, with equivalent findings in control &#x003b2;-galactosidase&#x02013;treated mice (not shown). For each B cell subset, the IgM<sup>a</sup> or LJ-26 reactivity was used to derive the percentages representative of clan VHIII&#x02013;expressing B cells.</p></caption><fig id="F7ab" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="JEM000065.f7ab"/></fig><fig id="F7c" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="JEM000065.f7c"/></fig></fig-group></floats-group></article>

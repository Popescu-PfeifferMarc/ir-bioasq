We demonstrate that CD4 T cells lacking IFN-&#x003b3; production were required to passively transfer EAE, indicating that they were disease-mediating cells in IFN-&#x003b3; knockout (KO) mice. IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice accumulated 10&#x02013;16-fold more activated CD4 T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>) than wild-type mice in the central nervous system during EAE. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells in the spleen and central nervous system of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice during EAE showed markedly increased in vivo proliferation and significantly decreased ex vivo apoptosis compared with those of wild-type mice. IFN-&#x003b3; KO CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells proliferated extensively to antigen restimulation in vitro and accumulated larger numbers of live CD4<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells. IFN-&#x003b3; completely suppressed proliferation and significantly induced apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells responding to antigen and hence inhibited accumulation of live, activated CD4 T cells. We thus present novel in vivo and in vitro evidence that IFN-&#x003b3; may limit the extent of EAE by suppressing expansion of activated CD4 T cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>T lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>autoimmune diseases</kwd><kwd>animal disease models</kwd><kwd>knockout mice</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The role of IFN-&#x003b3; in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was originally thought to be pathogenic <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref>.

We report here that activated CD4 T cells in the spleen and central nervous system (CNS) of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice proliferate more and undergo decreased apoptosis compared with those in wild-type mice. Thus, IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice accumulate large numbers of activated CD4 T cells in the spleen and CNS during EAE.

<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>, we found that IFN-&#x003b3; KO C57BL/6 mice were highly susceptible to MOG and myelin basic protein&#x02013;induced EAE and had a chronic, progressive, and more severe course of disease than wild-type mice (data not shown).</p><p>Most CD4 T cell lines that passively transfer EAE make IFN-&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref>.

In both wild-type and IFN-&#x003b3; KO recipients, mice that received whole spleen cells developed EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), while depletion of CD4 T cells from spleen cells completely abolished the transfer of EAE in both wild-type and IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). These results clearly indicate that in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice, CD4 T cells are required for passive transfer of EAE and suggest that they are effector cells in actively induced EAE.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased In Vivo Accumulation of Activated CD4 T Cells in IFN-&#x003b3; KO Mice with EAE.</title><p>The kinetics of accumulation of activated CD4 T cells was followed during the course of EAE. Ag-experienced CD4 T cells express high levels of CD44 after activation <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>. We used CD44<sup>hi</sup> expression as a marker for activated CD4 T cells. CD4 T cells that were CD44<sup>hi</sup> were also CD45RB<sup>low</sup> and CD62L<sup>low</sup>. This is consistent with an activated phenotype <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>. 2 wk after immunization, the population of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells in the spleen markedly increased from an average of 20% of CD4 T cells to 38% in wild-type and to 57% in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice. The extent of the increase in absolute number of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells was greater in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice. Approximately threefold more CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells were found in the spleens of IFN-&#x003b3; KO than wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A).

At 4 wk of immunization, there were 13-fold more CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells in the CNS of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice, and at 10 wk, there were 10-fold more than in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> C).</p></sec><sec><title>Increased In Vivo Proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T Cells in IFN-&#x003b3; KO Mice during EAE.</title><p>IFN-&#x003b3; has been shown to inhibit proliferation of T cells in vitro <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>

<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>. A unique tool, the IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice have allowed us to extend these in vitro observations in vivo to explore the effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on CD4 T cells in a CD4 T cell&#x02013;mediated disease. We investigated the in vivo proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells during EAE using a BrdU assay. Compared with wild-type mice, the spleen and CNS of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice had a significantly higher percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells incorporating BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A), indicating that they were proliferating in vivo. This gave rise to a greater number of proliferating CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells in the spleen and CNS in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice during EAE. Between 2 and 4 wk after immunization, the number of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells incorporating BrdU in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice was 2.5&#x02013;5-fold in the spleen and 4.8&#x02013;6-fold in the CNS of that in wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased Apoptosis of Activated CD4 T Cells in the CNS of IFN-&#x003b3; KO Mice with EAE.</title><p>Another possible mechanism for controlling expansion of activated CD4 T cells in the CNS is apoptosis of this population. We have found that IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice failed to induce apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells during infection with <italic>M. bovis</italic> Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref>. This prompted us to consider this possibility in this EAE model. Freshly isolated spleen cells and mononuclear cells from the CNS of mice with EAE were analyzed for apoptosis using an annexin/PI flow cytometric assay. In the spleen at 14 and 21 d after immunization, IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice had a significantly lower percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells that were apoptotic compared with those in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B). Additionally, IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice had a significantly lower percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells that were apoptotic in the CNS. On day 28 after immunization, there were 20 &#x000b1; 3.4% apoptotic CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells in the CNS of wild-type mice compared with 11.5 &#x000b1; 1% apoptotic in the CNS of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B).</p><p>Thus, in vivo activated CD4 T cells of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice responding to MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub> immunization displayed increased in vivo proliferation and decreased apoptosis. This likely contributes to the increased number of activated CD4 T cells seen in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice during EAE.</p></sec><sec><title>Enhanced Response of IFN-&#x003b3; KO CD4 T Cells to MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub> In Vitro and Inhibition by IFN-&#x003b3;.</title><p>Consistent with previous findings <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>, we observed markedly enhanced proliferation of IFN-&#x003b3; KO spleen cells to MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub> restimulation in vitro and unresponsiveness of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). We considered that APCs in the spleens of wild-type mice might be suppressing CD4 T cell proliferation and used MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub>-pulsed, LPS-activated B cells as APCs to stimulate wild-type CD4 T cells. In contrast to CD4 T cells cultured with their own spleen cells as APCs, CD4 T cells purified from immunized wild-type mice significantly proliferated to MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub> when cultured with activated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). Thus, it appears that wild-type APCs are suppressing CD4 T cell proliferation.</p><p>We proceeded to study the effects of IFN-&#x003b3; on proliferation of activated CD4 T cells in vitro in response to the priming Ag, MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55.</sub> We used a CFSE labeling assay to specifically measure the kinetics of activated CD4 T cell proliferation in whole spleen cell culture. Neutralization of IFN-&#x003b3; significantly increased the percentage of dividing wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells to MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub>, especially at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B). Conversely, addition of IFN-&#x003b3; to IFN-&#x003b3; KO cultures inhibited proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells. Thus, IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses proliferation of activated CD4 T cells during in vitro Ag restimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of Apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T Cells by IFN-&#x003b3; In Vitro.</title><p>We then tested the effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on apoptosis and death of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells in response to Ag restimulation.

Addition of IFN-&#x003b3; to IFN-&#x003b3; KO cultures significantly decreased the number of live CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells to 35 &#x000b1; 10%. At the same time, the percentage of apoptotic and dead CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). Conversely, neutralization of IFN-&#x003b3; in wild-type cultures significantly increased the number of live CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells to 54 &#x000b1; 9% and decreased the percentage of apoptotic and significantly decreased the percentage of dead CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> A). A second apoptosis assay, the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling) method, was also used to measure in vitro apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells and produced similar results (not shown). These data indicate that IFN-&#x003b3; induces apoptosis and death of activated CD4 T cells during in vitro restimulation with Ag.</p></sec><sec><title>The Suppressive Effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on In Vitro Accumulation of Activated CD4 T Cells Responding to Ag.</title><p>We counted the total number of cells during in vitro restimulation with MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub> and calculated the absolute number of live CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup> T cells.

<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref> and in vitro proliferation of primary lymphocytes from mice with EAE in a bulk cell culture <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>, there have been no reports addressing the role of IFN-&#x003b3; on in vivo proliferation of CD4 T cells in mice with EAE. Our data provide critical evidence that there is increased in vivo proliferation of activated CD4 T cells in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice with EAE. However, increased proliferation of T cells does not necessarily lead to increased accumulation of T cells, as another mechanism for controlling T cell expansion is increased death. We demonstrate here for the first time that in IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice with EAE-activated CD4 T cells taken ex vivo from the CNS and spleen are undergoing decreased apoptosis. We also demonstrate for the first time that addition of IFN-&#x003b3; to activated CD4 T cells from IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice induced apoptosis of these cells in response to Ag restimulation. Thus, the mechanism by which IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits EAE is both by inhibiting proliferation and by inducing apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells. The absence of IFN-&#x003b3; results in a massive accumulation of activated CD4 T cells in the CNS and spleen after challenge with myelin proteins.</p><p>We and others have observed increased inflammation and increased demyelination in the CNS of IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>, suggesting an IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;independent pathway that can mediate destruction of myelin. Two recent reports have demonstrated that there are large numbers of neutrophils in the CNS of mice lacking IFN-&#x003b3; or IFN-&#x003b3;R <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>. IFN-&#x003b3; KO mice express chemokines in the CNS that attract neutrophils <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>. Another report has shown that depletion of mice with antigranulocyte Ab inhibits EAE in both SJL and IFN-&#x003b3;R KO mice <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R18">18</xref>. The relationship between large numbers of CD4 T cells and neutrophils in the CNS and the role of each type of cell in mediating myelin destruction is not clear. It is possible that the activated CD4 T cells may produce chemokines that attract neutrophils or vice versa.</p><p>We show in another study, by Dalton et al., published in this issue that IFN-&#x003b3; is not acting directly on CD4 T cells but rather is acting indirectly through activated macrophages and nitric oxide (NO) <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref>. Whether activated macrophages in the spleen or CNS play a role in induction of apoptosis by IFN-&#x003b3; during EAE is currently under investigation. Our preliminary evidence in the EAE model is that NO may play a role in suppressing proliferation of activated CD4 T cells. There is in vitro evidence that NO plays a role in inhibiting Ag-specific T cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref> and in inducing apoptosis of encephalitogenic T cell clones <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>. Furthermore, EAE is exacerbated in inducible NO synthase KO mice <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref>. We hypothesize that during EAE, CD4 T cells making IFN-&#x003b3; infiltrate the CNS and activate macrophages, microglia, or dendritic cells to make NO. NO may then induce apoptosis of activated CD4 T cells, shutting down the immune response and inducing a remission of disease. In the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;, the mechanism to eliminate activated CD4 T cells is impaired, the activated CD4 T cells and neutrophils accumulate, and the disease is chronic and progressive.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a Trudeau Institute grant (IHP-85 to D.K.

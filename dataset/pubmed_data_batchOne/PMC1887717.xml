Maturation of D1 cells, characterized by markedly increased expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules, was induced by incubation with lipopolysaccharide, agonistic CD40 antibody, or specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper (Th) cells. Activated, but not immature, D1 cells efficiently primed alloreactive T cell responses in vitro. Similarly, priming of CTL immunity in vivo in CD4-depleted mice was only observed if these mice were immunized with activated D1 cells. This study provides formal evidence that activation of DCs, induced by Th-independent as well as Th-dependent stimuli, is essential for efficient induction of CTL responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>CD40 ligation</kwd><kwd>lipopolysaccharide</kwd><kwd>Th cells</kwd><kwd>cytotoxic T lymphocyte induction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) comprise a family of professional APCs that are present in low numbers in many body tissues <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref>. DCs are crucial for the initiation of primary immune responses of both helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and thus act as &#x0201c;nature's adjuvant&#x0201d;. DCs can differentiate from immature to mature stages. Maturation of DCs is characterized by a decreased antigen processing capacity and an increased cell surface expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref>. In addition, rearrangement of cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>, adhesion molecules <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref>, and cytokine receptors <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R6">6</xref> upon maturation allows DCs to migrate to lymphoid organs, where they can induce primary T cell responses.</p><p>An important cognate event in the development of cell-mediated immunity is the interaction between CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L). CD40 is fairly widely distributed and is expressed on B lymphocytes, monocytes, and DCs, but also on endothelial and epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>. The ligand of CD40 (CD40L or CD154) has a more restricted distribution, being mainly expressed by activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R8">8</xref>. In vivo, use of CD40-stimulatory antibodies has shown that CD40 signaling provides help for the induction of CTL responses <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>. The CD40-specific antibody FGK45 was capable of replacing T cell help in CD4-depleted mice for cross-priming adenovirus- and OVA-specific CTLs <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>. The fact that the role of B cells was excluded implied the involvement of DCs. Still, activation and functional antigen presentation by DCs was not formally proven in these in vivo experiments. In related studies, DC populations were used for activation by CD40 antibodies in vitro and tested for their CTL priming capacity in vitro and in vivo <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref>. However, these DCs were not phenotypically immature, as indicated by their very high expression levels of B7.2. No studies have been reported in which highly purified immature and mature DC preparations have been compared with respect to their CTL-inducing capacity in vitro and/or in vivo. It is indeed very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain such pure populations. We have therefore used the well characterized growth factor&#x02013;dependent, long term DC line D1 to examine the role of activation of DCs by different stimuli in the induction of T cell responses. This nontransformed homogeneous DC population is of C57BL/6 origin and is spleen derived <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>. Immature D1 cells are characterized by proliferative capacity, high antigen uptake ability, and low T cell&#x02013;stimulatory efficiency, thus behaving as &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; immature DCs. Moreover, expression levels of costimulatory molecules and cell surface MHC class I molecules are low, whereas cell surface MHC class II expression is intermediate. Upon activation by living bacteria or the bacterial component LPS, D1 cells can be activated to full maturation. This results in cell growth arrest, low antigen uptake, and high expression of costimulatory and MHC molecules at the cell surface <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R12">12</xref>.</p><p>Although the concept of requirement of DC maturation for CTL induction is well established, no formal evidence bearing out this concept has been published thus far. Here we report that functional maturation of DCs is essential for effective CTL priming capacity in vitro and in vivo. In the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, this can be achieved independently by either of two signals: CD40 triggering or LPS stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>Female C57BL/6 (B6; H-2<sup>b</sup>) and BALB/c (H-2<sup>d</sup>) mice were obtained from IFFA Credo, and BALB/c &#x000d7; C57BL/6 F1 (CB6 F1, H-2<sup>dxb</sup>) mice were from Charles River Laboratories.

CB6 F1 mice were used to avoid alloresponses (Th1 cells are BALB/c derived).

D1 cells can be maintained in culture in an immature state, as indicated by very low levels of costimulatory molecules (B7.2 [CD86] and CD40) and low to intermediate levels of MHC class I (K<sup>b</sup>) and II (I-A<sup>b</sup>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). When incubated with the CD40-specific agonistic antibody FGK45 or the CD40-independent stimulus LPS for 48 h, D1 cells exhibit strongly elevated levels of the costimulatory molecules B7.2 and CD40 as well as MHC class I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This demonstrates that triggering of CD40 on D1 cells using the FGK45 mAb induced maturation of these cells similar to LPS.</p></sec><sec><title>Improved Induction of Allospecific T Cell Responses by FGK45- and LPS-treated D1 Cells.</title><p>We observed that LPS- or FGK45-matured D1 cells are more efficient in presenting both MHC class I and class II binding peptides derived from OVA to peptide-specific MHC class I&#x02013; or class II&#x02013;restricted T cell hybridomas (data not shown). This indicates that the induced MHC class I and class II molecules are functional and that the elevated expression of these molecules is associated with more efficient antigen presentation. We therefore investigated whether FGK45- or LPS-treated D1 cells are more efficient in induction of a primary MLR. Immature D1 cells and LPS- or FGK45-treated D1 cells were used as allogeneic stimulators for unprimed BALB/c spleen cells. B6 spleen cells were used as syngeneic control. D1 cells were titrated and cultured with a fixed number of spleen cells for 4 d. Both FGK45- and LPS-activated D1 cells induced much higher alloproliferation than nontreated D1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A). In the same experiment, we tested the presence of allospecific cytotoxic T cells in the MLR. After 6 d, the cultured cells were tested for specific cytotoxicity. CTL induction in vitro by both FGK45- and LPS-activated D1 cells was much more efficient than by immature D1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B). Thus, treatment of D1 cells with FGK45 or LPS led to functional maturation, which resulted in acquisition of the capacity to induce strong alloproliferative and allocytotoxic T cell responses.</p></sec><sec><title>In Vivo Priming of Antigen-specific CTLs by CD40- or LPS-stimulated D1 Cells in CD4-depleted Mice.</title><p>Next, we investigated whether the phenotypic and functional differences between immature and activated D1 cells as observed in vitro had consequences for their capacity to prime specific CTL immunity in vivo. Immature D1 cells, exogenously loaded with a human adenovirus CTL epitope (E1A<sub>CTL</sub>), were injected into CD4-depleted mice. 10 d after immunization, spleens were harvested and splenocytes were restimulated in vitro with Ad5E1-MECs. After 6 d, epitope-specific CTL activity was measured in a cytotoxicity assay. E1A<sub>CTL</sub> peptide&#x02013;loaded immature D1 cells did not prime peptide-specific CTLs in CD4-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A and 4 C), in agreement with our recent study <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref> describing the lack of Ad5E1A-specific CTL priming in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help. However, in this study, CTL priming was restored by in vivo CD40 triggering, which is thought to activate bone marrow&#x02013;derived APCs in vivo. Therefore, we studied whether in vitro&#x02013;activated D1 cells, using agonistic CD40 antibody or LPS as stimuli <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R16">16</xref>, were able to induce priming of peptide-specific CTLs in vivo. In contrast to immature D1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A, top panel), D1 cells activated in vitro by FGK45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> B, top panel) or LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> C, top panel) indeed primed E1A<sub>CTL</sub>-specific CTLs in vivo in CD4-depleted mice. The induction of E1A<sub>CTL</sub>-specific cytotoxicity correlated with elevated numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the bulk cultures that stained with PE-conjugated H-2D<sup>b</sup> tetramers containing the E1A<sub>CTL</sub> peptide (D<sup>b</sup>/E1A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, bottom panel).</p></sec><sec><title>In Vivo Priming of Antigen-specific CTLs in CD4-depleted Mice by D1 Cells Stimulated with CD4<sup>+</sup> Th Cells Plus Antigen.</title><p>The physiological activation signal through CD40 is thought to be delivered by CD40L<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells. We therefore investigated whether in vitro incubation of D1 cells with peptide-specific Th cells resulted in functional activation of these APCs. Phenotypic maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A) and IL-12 p40 production by D1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B) was induced by incubation of D1 cells with OVA-specific Th cells in the presence but not the absence of OVA<sub>Th</sub> peptide. As already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> A, immunization of CD4-depleted mice with peptide-loaded immature D1 cells failed to induce significant CTL immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> C). In contrast, five out of eight mice immunized with E1A<sub>CTL</sub> peptide&#x02013;loaded D1 cells that were preincubated with the OVA-specific Th cells showed strong E1A-specific CTL immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> D). No detectable CTL activity against control E7<sub>CTL</sub> peptide&#x02013;loaded target cells was observed for mice injected with immature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> E) or Th-treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> F) D1 cells. Therefore, in vitro Th-mediated activation empowered the DCs to prime CTL immunity in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These experiments provide formal evidence that CTL priming in vivo depends on DC activation. The required DC activation state can be induced by CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells or by triggering of DCs with agonistic CD40 antibody or LPS.</p><p>Although the concept that DCs require maturation for efficient induction of T cell responses is widely recognized <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R16">16</xref>, it has been mainly shown for induction of proliferative responses. In the &#x0201c;licence to kill&#x0201d; model <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref>

<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref>, Th cells activate APCs, thereby licensing them to directly activate CTLs. CD40-mediated maturation of mouse and human DCs by soluble <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref> and transfected CD40L- <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref> or CD40-specific antibody <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref> has been reported. However, in studies where immature and mature DCs are compared for CTL induction or tumor protection, DCs in the &#x0201c;immature&#x0201d; state express already quite high levels of costimulatory and MHC molecules <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref>. These studies therefore allow no firm conclusions on the DC phenotype required for CTL induction. Our experience with culturing, for example, bone marrow&#x02013;derived DCs in the presence of GM-CSF is that the purity and activation status of the resulting cells varies considerably between experiments, precluding firm conclusions on correlations between phenotype and function. By using the spleen-derived immature DC line D1, we were able to obtain a constant and reproducible source of pure and immature DCs that could be induced to mature by physiological (anti-CD40) and bacterial (LPS) stimuli in a well controlled fashion.</p><p>The anti-CD40 antibody FGK45 was used successfully in recent in vivo studies, illustrating the importance of the CD40&#x02013;CD40L interaction in CTL induction <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R10">10</xref>. Antibody-induced CD40 activation even caused a therapeutic effect of a peptide-based CTL-inducing vaccine against established HPV16-induced mouse tumors, whereas this vaccine had only preventive activity in the absence of CD40 triggering <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R15">15</xref>. However, in these studies, no formal proof was obtained that the in vivo FGK45 treatment directly stimulated DCs and that this was causally related to the observed effects. In this study, we show that the antibody FGK45 directly activates the DC line D1, endowing these DCs with powerful CTL-inducing capacity in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>FGK45- and LPS-treated D1 cells showed elevated levels of MHC class I and II and strongly increased levels of the costimulatory molecules B7.2 and CD40. Incubation with CD40L&#x02013;CD8 fusion protein led to a similar level of phenotypic maturation of D1 cells (data not shown), indicating that FGK45 triggers CD40 in a physiological way. Mature D1 cells were capable of effective induction of both MHC class I&#x02013; and class II&#x02013;directed alloresponses in vitro and peptide-specific CTL responses in vivo. The acquisition of the capacity to induce CTLs most likely is the result of both the increase in the expression of MHC class I and costimulatory molecules and the profile of cytokine production by mature DCs. Our data suggest that activation of the DCs is more important than the way in which the cells are activated for induction of CTL responses. The efficiency of CTL induction in vivo in CD4-depleted mice by in vitro LPS-matured DCs suggests that even CD40-independent activation of DCs leads to efficient CTL induction. This indicates the possibility that CD8<sup>+</sup> CTL responses can be induced both by CD4<sup>+</sup> Th-dependent (CD40-mediated) and CD4<sup>+</sup> Th-independent pathways of DC activation. CD40 ligation by CD40L expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells might be the most relevant maturation condition for DCs in case of the lack of inflammatory conditions, such as many instances of tumor growth or responses to minor histocompatibility antigens, both of which are profoundly CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cell dependent <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R22">22</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R23">23</xref>. In a recent study, CD40-independent, Th-dependent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming was reported, although a major CD40-dependent pathway of CTL activation was shown <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R21">21</xref>. In the case of strong inflammatory viruses or bacteria, however, DCs can apparently become activated in a CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cell&#x02013;independent way <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref>

<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R26">26</xref>. In addition, antiviral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were shown to be capable of inducing functional maturation of DCs in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R27">27</xref>. Clearly, the extent of DC maturation and/or polarization is a major determinant of the CD4<sup>+</sup> helper dependence of CTL responses against infectious agents and tumor cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. D.

Bulk cultures were analyzed for the presence of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells capable of interacting with the H-2D<sup>b</sup>&#x02013;E1A<sub>CTL</sub> tetrameric complexes. Indicated are percentages of the CD8<sup>+</sup> cells staining with H-2D<sup>b</sup>&#x02013;E1A<sub>CTL</sub> tetramers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM992002.f3"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Priming of peptide-specific CTLs in vivo by D1 cells stimulated in vitro by specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells. B7.2 (CD86) expression of D1 cells was measured after 48-h incubation with Th1 cells in the presence or absence of 5 &#x003bc;M OVA<sub>Th</sub> peptide (A). IL-12 p40 production was measured in supernatants of cultures containing D1 cells and OVA<sub>Th</sub>-specific Th1 cells in the presence or absence of OVA<sub>Th</sub> peptide (B). Immature D1 cells (C and E) and D1 cells incubated with OVA<sub>Th</sub>-specific Th1 cells and OVA<sub>Th</sub> peptide (D and F) were used for in vivo CTL induction after loading with E1A<sub>CTL</sub> peptide and injecting them into CD4-depleted mice. Four mice were injected with E1A<sub>CTL</sub>-loaded immature D1 cells (C and E); eight mice were injected with E1A<sub>CTL</sub>-loaded D1 cells that had been preincubated for 48 h with OVA<sub>Th</sub>-specific Th cells in the presence of 5 &#x003bc;M OVA<sub>Th</sub> peptide (D and F). 10 d after immunization, spleen cells were restimulated with Ad5E1-MECs and tested in a cytotoxicity assay using E1A<sub>CTL</sub> peptide&#x02013;loaded (C and D) or control E7<sub>CTL</sub> peptide&#x02013;loaded (E and F) RMA cells as targets. Data shown are means of triplicates. Each line represents one mouse.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM992002.f4"/></fig></floats-group></article>

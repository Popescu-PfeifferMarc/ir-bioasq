These autoantibodies typically display a long Ig heavy (IgH) complementarity determining region (CDR)3 enriched in positively charged residues, a pattern that is believed to favor self-reactivity especially against DNA (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Most of the polyreactive antibodies and ANAs are removed from the repertoire during B cell development thereby ensuring self-tolerance (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Three central mechanisms are responsible for self-reactive antibody silencing: receptor editing, anergy, and deletion (for review see reference <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, central tolerance is imperfect, and some self-reactive B cells are exported from the bone marrow to the periphery where they can be deleted (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), remain &#x0201c;ignorant&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), or anergic (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>The self-reactive B cells that escape deletion are thought to benefit the organism by producing antibodies that play a role in the clearance of apoptotic cells and in the initial immune response to infections (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In the mouse, these &#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; antibodies are produced by two subsets of peripheral B cells: B1 cells and marginal zone B cells, both of which are positively selected by self-antigens (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Natural antibodies are also found in human serum (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), but the human counterpart of the murine natural antibody producing B cell is not well defined. CD5, a molecule specifically expressed on mouse B-1a B cells, is expressed at variable levels on all human peripheral blood B cells and therefore cannot be used as a marker for the human counterpart of murine B1-a B cells (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Thus, there is little understanding of the origin of self-reactive antibodies in humans despite the observation that inappropriate autoantibody production is a characteristic of most autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>We have identified a population of human B cells that coexpress surrogate and conventional light chains, V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells, whose antibodies display sequence features that suggested that they might be self-reactive (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, Ig kappa light chain sequences showed evidence of receptor editing that may have silenced V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To determine the specificity of the antibodies expressed by V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells, we sorted single B cells from two unrelated healthy donors, cloned their IgH and Ig light chains, expressed the recombinant antibodies, and tested them for self-reactivity. Here we report that the majority of V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells produce self-reactive and polyreactive antibodies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Single Cell Sorting.</title><p>All samples were collected after signed informed consent in accordance with Institutional Review Board&#x02013;reviewed protocols.

The overall efficiency of cloning both heavy and light chain genes from individual B cells was 40&#x02013;60%. Antibodies composed of heavy chains and V-preB/&#x003bb;&#x02013;like with or without conventional light chains were not secreted and could not be assayed.</p><p>V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells represent only 0.5&#x02013;1% of all circulating B cells. To obtain pure populations of these cells, we initially enriched V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cell using magnetic beads and then performed two additional rounds of cell sorting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) . We found that the sequence features of Igs cloned from single V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells were similar to those obtained from batch-sorted cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). IgHs displayed increased J<sub>H</sub>6 usage (20.7% in V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> versus 0% in V-preB<sup>&#x02212;</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells) and longer CDR3s (15.3 amino acids in V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> versus 12.2 amino acids in V-preB<sup>&#x02212;</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells, P = 0.005). In addition, we found that antibodies from V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells showed an increased prevalence of basic amino acid residues in IgH CDR3s (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) . As in batch-sorted cells, Ig&#x003ba; genes from single V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells showed increased downstream J&#x003ba;3, J&#x003ba;4, and J&#x003ba;5 segment usage compared with Ig&#x003ba;s from conventional V-preB<sup>&#x02212;</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells (27.5% in V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> versus 16.5% in V-preB<sup>&#x02212;</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells) (Tables S1 and S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20031550/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20031550/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).

Finally, 97% of Ig sequences isolated from single V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells was in germline configuration (Table S2).

<italic>B Cell Antibodies Are Self-reactive.</italic> To determine whether the antibodies expressed by V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells were self-reactive, we expressed 28 antibodies obtained from single V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells and compared them with 21 antibodies from conventional V-preB<sup>&#x02212;</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells. As an initial screen for self-reactivity, we used a commercially available ELISA for antinuclear antibodies (ANA). This assay detects antibodies that recognize antigens in HEp-2 cell lysates, and therefore, reactivity is not restricted to ANAs but includes a broad spectrum of self-antigens. We found that 68% of V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> antibodies (19 out of 28) showed reactivity against HEp-2 cell lysates compared with 14.5% of antibodies (3 out of 21) isolated from V-preB<sup>&#x02212;</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Finding that 14.5% of the antibodies from conventional B cells reacted with HEp-2 cell lysate was consistent with previous reports that 10&#x02013;30% of IgMs from peripheral B cells transformed by Epstein-Barr Virus were similarly reactive and that 20% of naive B cells expressed such antibodies (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). To determine whether the HEp-2 ELISA-reactive antibodies were true ANAs, we performed indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs). Overall, 54% of V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> antibodies tested showed true ANA reactivity in several distinct staining patterns including nucleolar (KR9), mitotic spindle apparatus (ED11), speckled (ED20, ED44), and other uncharacterized patterns (ED13, ED38, ED41, ED45) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). Three of the HEp-2&#x02013;reactive antibodies expressed by V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells that were not ANAs displayed reactivity against the cytoskeleton with patterns reminiscent of anti&#x02013;stress fiber (ED16), antivinculin (ED19), and antivimentin (ED37) antibodies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B). In contrast, none of the 21 antibodies cloned from conventional V-preB<sup>&#x02212;</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells showed authentic ANA staining. We conclude that a high proportion of V-preB<sup>+</sup>
<bold>L</bold>

<bold>B cells express ANAs and other self-reactive antibodies, whereas conventional B cells rarely express ANAs.</bold>

To determine whether V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> antibodies recognize such antigens, we performed ELISAs for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), IgM, insulin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) . As a positive control for polyreactivity, we used M55, a well-characterized polyreactive human antibody (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). 43% of antibodies expressed by V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> cells (12 out of 28) recognized at least one of the above antigens and 32% (9 out of 28) bound to two or more antigens and were therefore polyreactive (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). All of the polyreactive antibodies isolated from V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells showed long IgH CDR3s enriched in positively charged, hydrophobic, and aromatic amino acid residues encoded by unusual D reading frames and germline J<sub>H</sub>6 segments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) . Thus, the polyreactive antibodies showed the typical signature of V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> Igs (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In contrast, only 4.8% (1 out of 21) of the antibodies expressed by conventional B cells were polyreactive, and these antibodies showed lower levels of reactivity than those from V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> or M55 controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Similar low frequencies of polyreactivity were found in 93 antibodies cloned from naive human B cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The one weakly polyreactive antibody isolated from conventional B cells differed from V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> polyreactive antibodies in having a short IgH CDR3 without positively charged residues (KRV-18; Table S1).

However, antibody sequences alone cannot predict autoreactivity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Indeed, transgenic mouse B cells that express authentic self-reactive heavy chains usually produce innocuous antibodies because of light chain receptor editing (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). To determine whether V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells express self-reactive antibodies, we cloned antibodies from purified single cells. We report herein that most V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells express self-reactive antibodies. Antibodies produced by V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells differ from low affinity self-reactive or polyreactive antibodies produced by 10&#x02013;20% of all naive peripheral B cells in several respects (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> antibodies show higher affinities for self-antigens, and most V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> antibodies are true ANAs, whereas these are infrequent (&#x0223c;4%) among conventional B cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In addition, V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> antibodies display specific sequence features that are associated with autoantibodies (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). They frequently have long CDR3s enriched in aromatic and positively charged amino acids, a combination that favors anti-DNA reactivity (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Positively charged amino acids can interact with the negatively charged phosphate backbone in nucleic acids, and long CDR3s enriched in aromatic residues may facilitate the interaction by stacking (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). These features may also favor polyreactivity by creating a flexible binding site (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>55% of early immature B cells found in the bone marrow of normal humans express ANAs and polyreactive antibodies. The ontology of V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells is unknown, but their surface features differ from early immature B cell precursors that also frequently produce self-reactive antibodies (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). For example, V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells do not express immature B cell markers such as CD38 and CD10 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Most importantly, early immature B cells do not express surface B cell receptor (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, the antibodies expressed by V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells resemble those found in early immature B cells in that they are polyreactive antibodies with long IgH CDR3s and increased frequency of positively charged residues (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Most of these self-reactive antibodies are removed from the repertoire during the immature B cell stage in the bone marrow and in the transition between the immature B cell and naive B cell stage in the periphery (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Thus, very few B cells producing highly polyreactive antibodies and ANAs are found in the mature B cell compartment, but they are highly enriched in the V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cell subpopulation. How tolerance is maintained by V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells is not known, but these cells do not show low B cell receptor surface levels, and therefore, they do not resemble anergic B cells (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Since expression of surrogate light chains encoded by &#x003bb;-like and V-preB genes is normally extinguished in immature B cells, why do V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells retain V-preB protein expression after completing B cell development? One clue to a selective advantage for V-preB expression in these cells may be that a large number of the V-preB antibodies bind to DNA. In the mouse, DNA binding antibodies that carry positively charged residues in IgH CDR3 are silenced or &#x0201c;edited&#x0201d; by light chains that have CDRs with low isoelectric points (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Similarly, in transgenic mice that carry anti-DNA&#x02013;reactive antibodies, self-reactive B cells are normally deleted in early B cell development, but coexpression of an additional Ig light chain with a low isoelectric point allows continued development, possibly by dilution of autoreactive receptors (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These dual receptor-expressing B cells then accumulate in the marginal zone B cell compartment. Human V-preB with an isoelectric point of 5.67 may act as an &#x0201c;editor&#x0201d; and substitute conventional editing by light chain gene replacement by neutralizing positively charged IgH CDR3s expressed by V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells. In contrast, mouse V-preB1 and V-preB2 proteins have CDRs with isoelectric points of 9.37 and would therefore be unable to edit antibodies with positively charged IgH CDR3s. We propose that sustained expression of V-preB proteins is similar to dual receptor expression in autoreactive mouse B cells (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and may rescue V-preB<sup>+</sup>L<sup>+</sup> B cells from central deletion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank members of the Nussenzweig lab and Eva Besmer for comments and discussions, L.

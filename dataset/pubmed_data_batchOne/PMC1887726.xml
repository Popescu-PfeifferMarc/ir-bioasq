Here, we demonstrate genetically determined variation in the proliferation of lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca1<sup>++</sup>kit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells in response to transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) 2, the dose response of which was biphasic with a stimulatory effect at low concentrations. In contrast, the dose responses of TGF-&#x003b2;1 or -&#x003b2;3 were inhibitory and did not show mouse strain&#x02013;dependent variation. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for the effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 was identified on chromosome 4 overlapping with a QTL regulating the frequency of LSK cells. These overlapping QTL were corroborated by the observation that the frequency of LSK cells is lower in adult <italic>Tgfb2</italic>

In fetal TGF-&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient HSCs, a defect only appears after serial reconstitution. These data suggest that TGF-&#x003b2;2 can act cell autonomously and is important for HSCs that have undergone replicative stress. Thus, TGF-&#x003b2;2 is a novel, genetically determined positive regulator of adult HSCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>growth inhibitors</kwd><kwd>immunologic and biologic factors</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>autocrine communication</kwd><kwd>growth and embryonic development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>

Although these characteristics of stem cells have been established for some time, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The observation that HSC number and function vary in inbred stains of mice provides strong evidence that these mechanisms are, in part, genetically determined (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A powerful approach to begin to dissect the regulation of HSCs is the investigation of genetically determined variation in the function and size of the HSC compartment by quantitative trait analysis. We have demonstrated previously genetic variation in the number and frequency of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as determined by the lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca1<sup>++</sup>kit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) phenotype and in their response to the early acting cytokines kit ligand (KL), flt3 ligand (flt3L), and thrombopoietin (TPO). Linkage analysis identified quantitative trait loci on chromosomes 2, 4, and 7 for the frequency of LSK cells, and on chromosome 2 and X for their response to early acting cytokines (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The observation that differential responsiveness to these critical positive regulators of HSCs (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) may be involved in the genetic variation in the HSC compartment raised the question whether there is also genetic variation in the responsiveness to negative regulators. One of the most potent negative regulators of hematopoiesis is TGF-&#x003b2;1 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), which inhibits the proliferative response of hematopoietic progenitors to early acting cytokines (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2;1 is expressed in primitive hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells. Inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2;1 activity by antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides enhanced the proliferation of these cells in vitro (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and increased the repopulating capacity of HSCs in vivo (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), suggesting a negative regulatory role that is, in part, cell autonomous. Both mice and humans express two other TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms, TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3, that share significant sequence homology with and signal through the same receptor complex as TGF-&#x003b2;1 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Although some in vitro analyses have described a potent inhibitory effect for TGF-&#x003b2;3 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and a weaker inhibitory effect for TGF-&#x003b2;2 (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) on early hematopoietic progenitor cells, their role in hematopoietic regulation remains largely unknown. The role of the individual TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms in adult hematopoiesis in vivo is unclear as homozygous deletion of each is lethal at or shortly after birth (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>The goal of the studies reported here was to determine whether there is genetically determined variation in the responsiveness of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to TGF-&#x003b2; in inbred mice, and, if so, how this genetic variation would impact the regulation of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment in vivo. We show here that TGF-&#x003b2;2 is, in fact, a positive regulator of HSCs in vivo, and is likely involved in genetically determined variation in the function and size of the HSC compartment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>8-wk-old C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, BALB/cJ, BXD recombinant inbred (RI), and tgfb2<sup>tm1doe</sup> mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.

<sup>Pep3b/BoyJ</sup> mice (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>). Peripheral blood cells were analyzed for the expression of CD45.1, CD45.2, and lineage antigens (Thy-1, Gr-1, and B220) 12&#x02013;24 wk after transplantation. Competitive serial transplantations were performed 12&#x02013;24 wk after reconstitution by injecting 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> bone marrow cells from primary recipients into lethally irradiated secondary C57BL/6 (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) recipients, and from secondary recipients into lethally irradiated tertiary C57BL/6 (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) recipients. Three secondary or tertiary recipients were reconstituted with bone marrow from one donor. All transplant recipients survived. After 3 mo, the ratio between the competing cell populations cells was measured in the peripheral blood of the secondary or tertiary recipients. The data are presented as ratios between the two donor populations a determined by the expression CD45 alleles. Changes in reconstitution ratios between primary and secondary, or between secondary and tertiary recipients were analyzed by evaluating the difference in the logarithm of the reconstitution ratios &#x00394; (log ratio) in the respective recipients. The rationale for using ratios is that the change in the reconstitution ratio between primary and secondary recipients is a better measure of a shift in reconstitution capacity upon serial transplantation than a change in the percentage contribution of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> cells between primary and secondary recipients. This is because a change in the percent CD45.2<sup>+</sup> cells after serial transplantation from a 50% contribution level in the primary recipient reflects a smaller change in the function or the number of HSCs than the same change at higher or lower contribution levels in the primary recipient (i.e., a 5% change from 50 to 45% is a change in reconstitution ratio from 1 to 0.82, whereas a 5% change from 90 to 85% represents a much larger change in reconstitution ratio from 9 to 5.6). A better measure is the ratio between the CD45.2<sup>+</sup>/CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup> ratio pre- (input, primary recipient) and postsecondary (output, secondary recipient) reconstitution. With ratiometric data, the difference between log CD45.2<sup>+</sup>/CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup> ratios in primary and secondary recipients or in secondary and tertiary recipients can be used. An advantage of log transformation is that a ratio smaller than one will give a negative value, and negative ratios will extend over the same numerical ranges as positive ones (e.g., a ratio of 0.01 gives a log ratio of &#x02212;2, a ratio of 100 gives a log ratio of +2). Thus, data are presented as the difference between input log CD45.2<sup>+</sup>/CD45.1<sup>+</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup> (i.e., the log ratio in the first recipient) and the output log CD45.2<sup>+</sup>/CD45.1<sup>+</sup> CD45.2<sup>+</sup> (i.e., the log ratio 3 mo after reconstitution of the serial recipients), and will be referred to as &#x00394; (log ratio). Differences in the efficiency of serial repopulation were assessed by comparing the &#x00394; (log ratio) for recipients of WT or TGF-&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient bone marrow or fetal liver cells as competing cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis.</title><p>Student's <italic>t</italic> test for unpaired samples was used unless indicated otherwise.</p></sec><sec><title>Linkage Analysis in BXD RI Strains.</title><p>Linkage analysis was performed in BXD RI strains. These are commercially available and were generated by repeated inbreeding of F2 mice derived from the inbred progenitor strains C57BL/6 and DBA/2. The genome of RI strains is composed of a patchwork of homozygous chromosome segments derived from either progenitor strain, with each of the RI lines having a unique combination of &#x0201c;patches&#x0201d; from the progenitors (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Linkage analysis is performed by determining the relevant trait in each of the strains, which results in a strain distribution pattern. The data are analyzed using MapmanagerQTb29ppc software (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This software statistically analyzes the linkage of a given trait with previously typed polymorphic loci in the RI strains, which are inherited from either parental strain. This allows assignment of a trait to a corresponding map position, and the calculation of statistical significance according to published criteria (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

LSK cells from C57BL/6, DBA/2, and BALB/c mice, three mouse strains that display genetically determined variation in the HSC compartment (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), were used for these experiments. In these cultures, the dose response of TGF-&#x003b2;2 on the proliferation of LSK cells was significantly less inhibitory than the dose responses of TGF-&#x003b2;1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a) and TGF-&#x003b2;3 (not depicted). In addition, TGF-&#x003b2;2 had a significant (P &#x0003c; 0.05) net stimulatory effect on the proliferation of LSK cells at the lowest concentration tested (0.001 ng/ml) in the three mouse strains. These observations indicate that, in vitro, TGF-&#x003b2;2 has a biphasic dose response on the proliferation of LSK cells. Furthermore, the dose response of TGF-&#x003b2;2 showed genetically determined variation among the three mouse strains tested (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). LSK cells from BALB/c mice were significantly less responsive to the inhibitory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 at higher concentrations, and more responsive to the stimulatory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 at low concentrations than LSK cells from DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice. In contrast to the dose response of TGF-&#x003b2;2, the dose responses of TGF-&#x003b2;1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a) and TGF-&#x003b2;3 (not depicted) were similar in these three mouse strains.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 in vitro.

The addition of TGF-&#x003b2;2 at this concentration did not affect the cloning efficiency of these progenitors, which was &#x0223c;70% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> b). However, it did increase the average clone size by &#x0223c;1.9-fold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> b, P = 0.013) after 5 d of culture. A representative example using fetal liver&#x02013;derived LSK cells is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> c.

The fact that low concentrations of TGF-&#x003b2;2 are stimulatory, in contrast to the potent inhibitory effects of other TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) on the proliferation of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, might suggest that this effect is mediated by a different receptor. To address this question, we examined the effects of TGF-&#x003b2;2 in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to the TGF-RII. These antibodies blocked the stimulatory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 (at 0.001 ng/ml) on the proliferation of LSK cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> d), suggesting involvement of the canonical TGF-RII in the observed stimulatory response.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;1 is produced in primitive progenitor cells, and inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2;1 activity enhances the proliferative capacity of these cells in vitro (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether TGF-&#x003b2;2 is also expressed in LSK cells. RT PCR analysis showed that TGF-&#x003b2;2 mRNA is expressed in purified fetal liver and bone marrow&#x02013;derived LSK cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> e).

To investigate whether endogenous TGF-&#x003b2;2 affects the proliferative capacity of LSK cells, we tested the effect of anti&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2;2 antibodies. Affinity-purified anti&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2;2 antibodies significantly inhibited proliferation of LSK cells supported by the early acting cytokines flt3L, KL, and TPO by &#x0223c;50% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> f, P = 0.04). Preincubation of the antibody with recombinant TGF-&#x003b2;2 alleviated the inhibitory effect of these antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> f), indicating that this effect was not due to toxicity. In contrast, addition of anti&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2;1 antibodies enhanced the proliferation of LSK cells two- to threefold (unpublished data), a finding consistent with previously published data (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Linkage Analysis in BXD RI Strains.</title><p>To further investigate mouse strain&#x02013;dependent variation in the dose response of TGF-&#x003b2;2, we performed linkage analysis using BXD RI strains. Although the TGF-&#x003b2;2 dose response in LSK cells from C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice (the progenitors of the BXD RI set) was very similar, linkage analysis was attempted using these strains because a relatively large number are readily available in this set. If a trait is multigenic, phenotypic variation can be more pronounced among RI strains than between their progenitor strains because the balance between positive-acting and negative-acting alleles present in the progenitor strains may be completely unbalanced in some of the RI strains (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This may allow quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification, even when phenotypic variation between the progenitor strains is not significant. The effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 at 0.1 ng/ml on the proliferation of LSK cells from 30 BXD RI strains was measured because this concentration revealed the most pronounced difference in the TGF-&#x003b2;2 dose response between the inbred strains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). The individual BXD strains showed wide variation in this assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> a), indicating that the responsiveness to TGF-&#x003b2;2 is indeed a multigenic trait. One QTL contributing to the effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 was identified on chromosome 4 between 67 (D4Mit158) and 79 (D4Mit33) cM (maximum likelihood ratio statistic 13.7; P = 0.00021). The level of significance was suggestive according to permutation analysis (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Although suggestive QTL require confirmation (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), the location of this QTL was compelling because this interval overlaps with the interval containing a previously identified QTL contributing to genetic variation in the pool size of lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca1<sup>++</sup> and of LSK cells in vivo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> b; reference <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).

<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> HSCs compared with WT HSCs is due to enhanced cycling of the former. This would imply that TGF-&#x003b2;2 is, in fact, a negative regulator of HSCs cycling in vivo. To investigate cycling activity within the HSC compartment of <italic>Tgfb2</italic>

In vitro, a direct stimulatory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 on the proliferation of LSK cells could be detected only at low concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations, TGF-&#x003b2;2 was a significantly weaker inhibitor of proliferation than TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;2. The phenotype of TGF-&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient mice suggests that it is the stimulatory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2, detected in vitro at low concentrations, that is relevant in vivo. The three known TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms in mice and humans have clearly distinct roles in vivo, as evidenced by the wide variation in the phenotypes of mice with a homozygous deletion of the genes encoding the individual TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms. Because all TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms activate the same Smad-mediated signaling pathway, these data are likely explained, at least in part, by their different expression patterns (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, a role for intrinsically different effects of TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms on specific cell types cannot be excluded. For example, in vivo and in embryonic skin organ cultures in vitro, hair follicle morphogenesis is enhanced by TGF-&#x003b2;2 and inhibited by TGF-&#x003b2;1 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The data presented here indicate that also in the regulation of renewal and differentiation of HSCs, TGF-&#x003b2;1, and TGF-&#x003b2;2 play different, and even opposing roles. A molecular explanation for these data could lie in the differences between TGF-&#x003b2;2 on one hand and TGF-&#x003b2;1 and -&#x003b2;3 on the other hand with respect to receptor binding. The TGF-RII (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), as well as accessory receptors including endoglin (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), which is expressed on repopulating HSCs (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), TGF-RIII (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), and some less well-characterized proteins (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) display differential binding affinities for TGF-&#x003b2;1 or -&#x003b2;3 compared with TGF-&#x003b2;2. Therefore, these proteins may be involved in the divergent hematopoietic effects of TGF-&#x003b2;2 compared with TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;3.</p><p>Despite a defect in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment, and even a small decrease in bone marrow cellularity, peripheral blood counts were normal in <italic>Tgfb2</italic>
<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice. These observations indicate that different and independent homeostatic mechanisms operate in the regulation of the early and late stages of hematopoiesis. The defect in serial repopulation capacity of TGF-&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient HSCs together with their lower sensitivity to the toxicity of 5-FU indicates that TGF-&#x003b2;2 acts on the most primitive HSCs. However, TGF-&#x003b2;2 induced a general increase in the clone size of growing LSK cells. LSK cells are still a functionally heterogeneous population, and only a minority of these cells are repopulating HSCs (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Furthermore, the proliferation of LSK cells in vitro is mainly differentiative. Therefore, our data indicate that TGF-&#x003b2;2 positively regulates a primitive progenitor cell population that includes, but is not limited to, the renewing HSCs.</p><p>The defect in the serial repopulation capacity of TGF-&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient HSCs suggests that TGF-&#x003b2;2 positively regulates HSCs in a cell autonomous, and likely autocrine, fashion in vivo. Although this contention is supported by our in vitro data showing a lower proliferative capacity of <italic>Tgfb2</italic>
<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> LSK cells and an inhibitory effect of anti&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2;2 antibodies on the proliferation of LSK cells, it cannot be entirely excluded that this defect is caused by the disappearance of a critical cellular element required for HSC proliferation and engraftment. However, the fact that in the serial transplantation experiments, WT C57BL/6 bone marrow cells were always cotransplanted makes this possibility unlikely. Autocrine regulation of HSCs has been demonstrated recently for vascular endothelial growth factor (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), and has been proposed for several other cytokines (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). An autocrine negative regulatory role of TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been suggested based previously on in vitro data, although its significance in vivo is unknown thus far (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Thus, the findings reported here may support the emerging concept that cell-autonomous, intrinsic mechanisms mediated by soluble factors participate in the regulation of HSCs.</p><p>The observation that TGF-&#x003b2;2 plays no role in fetal hematopoiesis in vivo is consistent with the finding that TGF-&#x003b2;2 regulates the responsiveness of LSK cells to KL, flt3L, and TPO. These cytokines and their respective receptors (c-kit, flt3, and c-mpl) are most critical in postnatal hematopoiesis (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), although KL plays a role in late-stage fetal hematopoiesis as well (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). However, in TGF-&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient fetal HSCs, a defect appeared upon serial transplantation, whereas in adult <italic>Tgfb2</italic>
<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> HSCs, the existing repopulation defect increased upon serial transplantation. Fetal and adult HSCs differ in their proliferative history (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), whereas repopulation of a lethally irradiated recipient represents a significant proliferative stress for HSCs (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Therefore, these findings suggest that TGF-&#x003b2;2 is mainly important for the function of long-term repopulating HSCs that have undergone replicative stress. An alternative explanation for these data is that because the stimulatory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 on LSK cells is subtle in vitro, a deficiency in TGF-&#x003b2;2 only gives rise to detectable phenotype after multiple renewal divisions (i.e., in adult HSCs or after serial transplantation). It is anticipated that the phenotype of <italic>Tgfb2</italic>
<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice will increase with aging. However, it has been proposed by several authors that a decrease in reconstitution capacity upon serial transplantation is not necessarily or not only due to replicative senescence (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Our data suggest that, because WT HSCs are more efficient at serial reconstitution that TGF-&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient HSCs, TGF-&#x003b2;2 may be implicated in this phenomenon.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the apparent reconstituting defect of TGF-&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient HSCs may be that TGF-&#x003b2;2&#x02013;deficient mature cells have a shorter life span, so that they will contribute less to the peripheral blood, without a real defect in stem cell function. However, our data argue against this contention. First, the defects in reconstitution were found in all lineages to a similar extent. Given the vastly different turnover rates of different types of blood cells, it would be difficult to explain these data by a generalized effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 on the life span of mature cells. Second, our in vivo 5-FU suicide data suggest that <italic>Tgfb2</italic>
<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> HSCs cycle more slowly than WT HSCs, indicative of a stem cell phenotype. The comparative cell cycle analysis of LSK cells from <italic>Tgfb2</italic>
<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice and from WT littermates in vivo again supports the idea that TGF-&#x003b2;2 is a specific positive regulator of the cycling activity in the stem cell compartment. Finally, the serial transplantation data strongly support the contention that the effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 is situated at the level of the stem cell compartment, and not at the level of survival of mature cells. Mature cells do not contribute to the peripheral blood 3 mo after transplantation. An increasing defect in repopulation capacity after each round of serial transplantation can only be due to a defect in the HSCs because that is the only cell that is responsible for the serial reconstitution (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). If only life spans of mature cells were affected, we would expect to see a similar small defect after each round of transplantation.</p><p>Although TGF-&#x003b2;2 responsiveness is a multigenic trait, only one suggestive QTL was identified in our paper. The lower frequency of lin-Sca1<sup>++</sup> and of LSK cells in <italic>Tgfb2</italic>
<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice corroborates the overlapping QTL on chromosome 4 for the dose response to TGF-&#x003b2;2 and for the number and frequency of lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca1<sup>++</sup> and of LSK cells in BXD RI strains. Because <italic>Tgfb2</italic>
<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice show a defect in the serial reconstitution capacity of HSCs, it is likely that genetically determined variation in the responsiveness to TGF-&#x003b2;2 also affects the function of HSCs in vivo. However, direct linkage analysis for the serial reconstitution capacity of HSC in BXD RI strains is impossible because of their immunological heterogeneity. Given the potential role of TGF-&#x003b2;2 in maintaining the function of HSCs that have undergone replicative stress, it will be of interest to determine whether TGF-&#x003b2;2 also plays a role in the significant genetic variation in the age-related decline in HSC function in inbred mice (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), which has been shown to be caused by cell intrinsic mechanisms (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Ms. P.

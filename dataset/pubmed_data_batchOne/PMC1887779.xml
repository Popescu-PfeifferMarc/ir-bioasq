It remains unclear, however, exactly how these channels are controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage. Excised inside-out patches containing many Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were used to study channel regulation. The currents were mediated by a single type of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel that exhibited an anionic selectivity of I<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x0003e; Br<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x0003e; Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (3.6:1.9:1.0), irrespective of the direction of the current flow or [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. However, depending on the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, this channel exhibited qualitatively different behaviors. At [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] &#x0003c; 1 &#x003bc;M, the currents activated slowly upon depolarization and deactivated upon hyperpolarization and the steady state current&#x02013;voltage relationship was strongly outwardly rectifying. At higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the currents did not rectify and were time independent. This difference in behavior at different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was explained by an apparent voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the channel. At +120 mV, the EC<sub>50</sub> for channel activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> was approximately fourfold less than at &#x02212;120 mV (0.9 vs. 4 &#x003bc;M). Thus, at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] &#x0003c; 1 &#x003bc;M, inward current was smaller than outward current and the currents were time dependent as a consequence of voltage-dependent changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. The voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity was explained by a kinetic gating scheme in which channel activation was Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent and channel closing was voltage sensitive. This scheme was supported by the observation that deactivation time constants of currents produced by rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration jumps were voltage sensitive, but that the activation time constants were Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive. The deactivation time constants increased linearly with the log of membrane potential. The qualitatively different behaviors of this channel in response to different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations adds a new dimension to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling: the same channel can mediate either excitatory or inhibitory responses, depending on the amplitude of the cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>ion channel gating</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>ion transport</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels play fundamental roles in physiological processes in many tissues, including secretion in airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wagneretal1991">Wagner et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Grayetal1995">Gray et al. 1995</xref>), repolarization of the cardiac action potential (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zygmunt1994">Zygmunt 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kawanoetal1995">Kawano et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wangetal1995">Wang et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Collieretal1996">Collier et al. 1996</xref>), regulation of vascular tone (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Nelsonetal1997">Nelson et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Yuan1997">Yuan 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Niliusetal1997a">Nilius et al. 1997a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Niliusetal1997b">Nilius et al. 1997b</xref>), modulation of photoreceptor light responses (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="BarnesandDeschenes1992">Barnes and Deschenes 1992</xref>), olfactory transduction (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="KurahashiandYau1994">Kurahashi and Yau 1994</xref>), neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="DeCastroetal1997">DeCastro et al. 1997</xref>), regulation of platelet cell volume (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Fineetal1994">Fine et al. 1994</xref>), and fast block to polyspermy in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="JaffeandCross1986">Jaffe and Cross 1986</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels may be involved in several human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and cardiac arrhythmias. Although defects in the CFTR Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel cause cystic fibrosis, upregulation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current in the airway of CFTR knockout mice can compensate for the lack of CFTR and ameliorate the pathology in this mouse model (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Clarkeetal1994">Clarke et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Grubbetal1994">Grubb et al. 1994</xref>).

Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels also play a role in the repolarization of the cardiac action potential and contribute to the transient outward current (I<sub>to</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="ZygmuntandGibbons1991">Zygmunt and Gibbons 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="ZygmuntandGibbons1992">Zygmunt and Gibbons 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zygmunt1994">Zygmunt 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zygmuntetal1998">Zygmunt et al. 1998</xref>.). Recently, it has been shown that dogs which are genetically prone to cardiac sudden death have an abnormal I<sub>to</sub> (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Freemanetal1997">Freeman et al. 1997</xref>), implying that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels might play a role in cardiac sudden death. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels also contribute to the transient inward current (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="HanandFerrier1992">Han and Ferrier 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="HanandFerrier1996">Han and Ferrier 1996</xref>), which is believed to trigger cardiac arrhythmias during Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Berlinetal1989">Berlin et al. 1989</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels in cell physiology, our understanding of the mechanisms of regulation and gating of these channels remains rudimentary. In different studies and cell types, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents behave differently. Often, these currents are voltage sensitive: they activate slowly on depolarization and deactivate on hyperpolarization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bib" rid="CliffandFrizzell1990">Cliff and Frizzell 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Arreolaetal1996">Arreola et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Niliusetal1997b">Nilius et al. 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="AndersonandWelsh1998">Anderson and Welsh 1998</xref>), but in other studies the currents appear time and voltage independent (e.g., <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xieetal1996">Xie et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Collieretal1996">Collier et al. 1996</xref>). It is not known whether this difference is due to differences in regulation of the same type of channel, to different experimental protocols, or to different molecular species of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels. There is strong evidence in the literature for the existence of several classes of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels that are differentially regulated. The single channel conductances reported for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels range from 1 to 50 pS (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Martyetal1984">Marty et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Frizzelletal1986">Frizzell et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Takahashietal1987">Takahashi et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Talebetal1987">Taleb et al. 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Talebetal1988">Taleb et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="MarunakaandEaton1990">Marunaka and Eaton 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Nishimotoetal1991">Nishimoto et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2947910N0x29223f0">Kl&#x000f6;ckner 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Collieretal1996">Collier et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="SchlenkerandFitz1996">Schlenker and Fitz 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Niliusetal1997a">Nilius et al. 1997a</xref>). Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents that appear similar at the macroscopic level can be regulated differently; e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents in T84 intestinal cells require CaMKII for activation, whereas those in rat parotid gland cells do not (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Arreolaetal1998">Arreola et al. 1998</xref>). The cloning of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current has been reported (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Cunninghametal1995">Cunningham et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gruberetal1998">Gruber et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Jietal1998">Ji et al. 1998</xref>), but it seems unlikely that this is the same channel studied here because the single channel conductance (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Takahashietal1987">Takahashi et al. 1987</xref>) and pharmacology (Hartzell, unpublished observations) differ.</p><p>
<italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes have long been a model system for studying Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Dascal1987">Dascal 1987</xref>) because these channels are the predominant channel type natively expressed in this cell and because they are expressed at extremely high levels (0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>). The <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents have been studied in considerable detail at the macroscopic level (see references in <xref ref-type="bib" rid="YaoandParker1993">Yao and Parker 1993</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bib" rid="KurumaandHartzell1999">Kuruma and Hartzell 1999</xref>). The inward and outward Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents are regulated differently: outward Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current is activated at lower cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] than is inward Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="KurumaandHartzell1999">Kuruma and Hartzell 1999</xref>). Although this difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity could be explained by two different classes of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels with different Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinities (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Botonetal1989">Boton et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hartzell1996">Hartzell 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="KurumaandHartzell1999">Kuruma and Hartzell 1999</xref>), it could also be explained by a single class of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel that exhibits voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="YaoandParker1993">Yao and Parker 1993</xref>). Because <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes have been such an important model system for the study of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels, we have begun a detailed investigation into the mechanisms of their regulation and gating. The purpose of the present investigation was to characterize quantitatively the regulation of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage in excised inside-out patches where cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> could be precisely controlled and to determine whether the macroscopic currents in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes could be explained by a single class of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels. We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes can be explained by a single class of channel that exists in multiple closed and open states. Channel opening absolutely requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> and is independent of voltage, but channel closing is voltage sensitive. At low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the probability of channel opening at hyperpolarized potentials is low because the rate of channel closure (voltage sensitive) is rapid relative to channel opening (Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive). As [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is increased, the rate of channel opening dominates at all potentials and the current becomes voltage independent. These features define a new aspect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, where a single effector molecule can behave qualitatively differently depending on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Solutions</title><p>Solutions containing different free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] were made by the method of <xref ref-type="bib" rid="TsienandPozzan1989">Tsien and Pozzan 1989</xref>. 0-Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution contained 150 mM NMDG-Cl, 5.07 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3 with NMDG.

In this experiment, the instantaneous current&#x02013;voltage relationship of the current was determined by measuring the amplitude of tail currents at different potentials after a depolarizing step to +120 mV with 160 mM Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> on both sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> A) or with 40 mM Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in the bath and 160 mM Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in the pipet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> B). In this experiment, the reversal potential of the current shifted +38.1 mV upon reducing extracellular [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]. On average, the reversal potential shifted +38.0 mV (symmetric Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> E<sub>rev</sub> = 0.1 &#x000b1; 0.43 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 18; asymmetric Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> E<sub>rev</sub> = +39.0 &#x000b1; 0.27 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 9). This shift was very close to the +36.3-mV shift predicted by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. We conclude that this current in the excised patch corresponds to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current I<sub>Cl1-S</sub> we have described in intact oocytes because they are both activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, carried by Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and have similar waveforms and steady state current&#x02013;voltage relationships.</p></sec><sec><title>Voltage Dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Current at Different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]</title><p>Although the channel rectified strongly and activated/deactivated slowly with voltage pulses at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the behavior was dramatically different at higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A&#x02013;F</xref>, shows a series of current traces from an excised patch exposed to different cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] from &#x0003c;10 nM to 2 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>. At [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] &#x0003e; 1 &#x003bc;M, the current traces had very different waveforms than they did at lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. As the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was increased, the outward current became increasingly dominated by the time-independent component. The current became essentially instantaneous at 2 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Also, rectification decreased with increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. At 2 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>, there were approximately equal amounts of steady state inward and outward currents at +120 and &#x02212;120 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> E). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> G shows that the steady state current&#x02013;voltage relationship changed from outwardly rectifying at &#x0003c;1 &#x003bc;M Ca to linear at &#x0003e;1 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

These data show that, depending critically on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the current exhibited qualitatively different rectification properties and waveforms.</p><p>The voltage dependencies of the currents at different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] were determined by plotting the conductance versus membrane potential. Conductance was determined by measuring the instantaneous currents at &#x02212;120 mV after pulses to various potentials (voltage protocol as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and dividing by the driving force (&#x02212;120 mV). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A shows the average conductance&#x02013;voltage curves (<italic>n</italic> = 4&#x02013;13 different patches). Increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] over a rather narrow range, between 0.1 and 1 &#x003bc;M, shifted the conductance&#x02013;voltage relationship strongly in the leftward direction and also significantly decreased the voltage dependence (slope). At the highest [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] examined, the currents exhibited little or no voltage dependence within the voltage range tested.</p><p>The reader will notice that at 2.2 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> the conductance at depolarized potentials was less than the conductance at 1 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This was due to a spontaneous decrease in current amplitude with time (rundown). This rundown phenomenon was irreversible and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent. The rate and magnitude of rundown were variable from patch to patch. For example, rundown was not obvious in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, but usually at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] &#x0003e; 1 &#x003bc;M the current decreased exponentially to 50% of its initial value in 3&#x02013;10 min. Patches in which rundown occurred rapidly were discarded from analysis, but otherwise we have not attempted to correct for rundown in any of the experiments shown here.</p><p>Quantitative analysis of the data was also compromised by the fact that it was usually not possible to maintain patches at voltages greater than &#x000b1;120 mV, and the maximum our amplifier would deliver was &#x000b1;200 mV, but voltages beyond this range were required to obtain the maximum and minimum conductances. Nevertheless, to estimate the voltage dependence, the available data for each [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] were fitted to the Boltzmann equation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hille1992">Hille 1992</xref>): <italic>G</italic> = <italic>G</italic>

Despite the limited voltage range, the fits were quite good. In the range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] where the data were most complete (between 0.5 and 1 &#x003bc;M), <italic>z</italic>, which is an estimate of the total gating charge movement, was &#x0223c;0.5.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> has shown that at 2.2 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> the channel cannot be closed by voltages as negative as &#x02212;120 mV and that at &#x0223c;10 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> the channel cannot be opened by voltages as positive as +120 mV. This suggests that channel opening is Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent and that the voltage-sensitive step is after Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> extends the voltage range and shows that the channel cannot be closed by voltages even as negative as &#x02212;200 mV. An excised patch was held at negative potentials for 10 s, and then stepped to +120 mV to measure the instantaneous current, to determine whether negative potentials could deactivate the current completely. At 500 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. B</xref>), a small, but significant outward current (30 pA) was recorded upon stepping from &#x02212;100 to +120 mV. Increasing the holding potential to &#x02212;200 mV had no significant effect on the magnitude of the instantaneous current. Thus, even at this intermediate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], it was not possible to close the channels by strong depolarization. At 1 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. D</xref>), the currents were larger, but their amplitudes were not significantly reduced by increasing the holding potential from &#x02212;160 to &#x02212;200 mV. From these results, it is clear that channel opening is not voltage gated and that voltage only modulates the current amplitude. Rather, channel opening is strictly dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the voltage sensitivity must occur at a later step.</p></sec><sec><title>Voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> Affinity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl Current</title><p>To analyze the voltage dependence of the current quantitatively, it was necessary to obtain recordings in the absence of significant rundown. Because rundown was Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent, we minimized rundown by reducing the amount of time the patch was exposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This was accomplished by using rapid solution changes that introduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> only during voltage-clamp trials and by using voltage-clamp trials having fewer episodes than those used in the previous figures. Using this approach, a few patches were obtained in which rundown was &#x0003c;10% during the time (&#x0223c;7&#x02013;10 min) required to obtain a complete set of current&#x02013;voltage curves at five different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. To assess the amount of rundown, the maximal current at 120 mV was measured at the start of the experiment (I<sub>INITIAL</sub>) during a brief (&#x0223c;10 s) exposure to 40 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The patch was then returned to &#x0003c;10 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution, except during the voltage clamp trials, when it was exposed to different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (from 170 nM to 40 &#x003bc;M). The amplitude of the current at 120 mV during the last voltage clamp trial in 40 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> (I<sub>FINAL</sub>) was compared with I<sub>INITIAL</sub>. In the case of the patch illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A, I<sub>INITIAL</sub> and I<sub>FINAL</sub> were virtually identical. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> B is a plot of conductance versus V<sub>m</sub> at different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Comparison of this plot to the averages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A shows that the general features and conclusions derived from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> are valid, despite the presence of rundown.</p><p>To determine the voltage dependence of the Ca sensitivity of the channel, we plotted the amplitude of the tail currents versus [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] for each voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> C), and the data were fitted to the Hill equation. This analysis shows that the apparent affinity of the channel for Ca<sup>2+</sup> decreased approximately fourfold from 4 &#x003bc;M at &#x02212;120 mV to 0.9 &#x003bc;M at +120 mV. The Hill coefficient ranged from 3.2 to 2.5 over the same voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> D). This analysis assumes that 40 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated the current maximally. This assumption was tested in other patches by comparing the amplitudes of the currents in 40 and &#x0223c;900 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The steady state current&#x02013;voltage curves were the same at these two Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> E).</p><p>The mean data from all patches including those exhibiting rundown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> F) were consistent with the conclusions obtained from the single patch in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A&#x02013;D</xref>. Because of rundown at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], data for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] &#x0003e; 1.1 &#x003bc;M were not included when fitting the mean data to the Hill equation. This limitation plus the presence of variable amounts of rundown at lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] resulted in a smaller quantitative dependence of the apparent <italic>K</italic>

This suggests the existence of multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liganded closed states in a voltage-dependent equilibrium with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liganded open states. We propose <xref ref-type="fig" rid="S1">Fig. 1</xref> to describe the data.</p><p>

</p><p>In this scheme, channel opening is controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to more than one site in a voltage-independent manner. The voltage dependence of the currents is proposed to be due to the voltage dependence of the closing rate constants &#x003b2; (V). At low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], where channel opening rate is slow, the current outwardly rectifies and exhibits time-dependent activation and deactivation, because hyperpolarization accelerates channel closure and shifts the equilibrium from the open to the closed states. In contrast, at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the channel opening rate is rapid and there are multiple paths for channel opening because channels have more than one Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound. Consequently, voltage-dependent changes in the closing rate will have less effect on the macroscopic currents. This scheme also explains why channels cannot be opened by depolarization in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or why they cannot be closed by voltage in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Voltage Dependence of Current Activation and Deactivation</title><p>To test this model further, we examined in detail the kinetics of current activation and deactivation at different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The deactivation was determined by exponential fitting of the tail current decay at various potentials after a depolarizing step to +120 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). At all [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] examined, the deactivating tail currents observed upon repolarization to different potentials from +120 mV were well fitted by single exponentials (superimposed, but hard to discern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). &#x003c4;<sub>deact</sub> increased with depolarization and increased with increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] within the submicromolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> A).

<italic>RT</italic> + <italic>b</italic>, was 0.35 at 280 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 0.27 at 460 nM, 0.26 at 680 nM, and 0.12 at 1 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> B). These data are consistent with a model in which there was a dominant rate-limiting transition in the backward direction from the open to the closed states, which was voltage sensitive at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. At higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the voltage sensitivity became less and deactivation was incomplete because the forward voltage-independent reaction shifted the equilibrium strongly towards open states, regardless of the backward voltage-dependent reaction.</p><p>We then examined the kinetics of current activation. Depolarizing steps elicited outward currents that exhibited a small instantaneous component followed by a slow activation that took &#x0223c;1 s to reach maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). Activation of the currents could be fitted with single exponentials, but the fits were often disappointing. Specifically, using least squares algorithms, if the rising phase of the current was well fit, the plateau was usually poorly fit. Using the Pade-LaPlace method (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="YeramianandClaverie1987">Yeramian and Claverie 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Bajzeretal1989">Bajzer et al. 1989</xref>) for fitting curves to sums of exponentials without a hypothesis about the number of components, one fast exponential component plus another slower nonexponential component were found. Regardless of the method used for fitting the activation, the time constants of the exponential components of the activation usually were weakly influenced by membrane potential or increased with depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref> A). If channel opening were voltage sensitive, we would expect channel activation to accelerate with depolarization. Although activation was not clearly voltage dependent, activation was Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent: activation became faster with increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref> B). We interpret the increased current produced by depolarization at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] as a consequence of a shift in the equilibrium between closed and open states as a result of changing the voltage-sensitive backward rate constant &#x003b2;. The time constant of the approach to the new equilibrium upon depolarization will approximate 1/(&#x003b1; [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] + &#x003b2;). Thus, as &#x003b2; becomes larger with hyperpolarization, the time constant of activation will become smaller for a constant &#x003b1; [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. This is observed with the lowest [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref> A. With higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], &#x003b1; [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dominates the reaction and the effect of changing &#x003b2; is negligible. As the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] becomes greater, the time constant of activation becomes smaller, as expected from the model.</p></sec><sec><title>Current Activation and Deactivation in Response to Rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> Applications</title><p>As another test of this model, we examined the response of the current to rapid applications of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at constant transmembrane potentials. The solution bathing the cytosolic face of the patch was changed from &#x0003c;10 nM Ca<sup>2</sup> to various [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in &#x0003c;3 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref> A) as described in <sc>METHODS</sc>.

The turn-on and -off of the current with rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> perfusion were characterized by time constants, called &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> and &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> to distinguish them from voltage-dependent activation &#x003c4;<sub>act</sub> and &#x003c4;<sub>deact</sub> described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>. At 40 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the current increased very rapidly (with a &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> that was probably limited by the switching time of the solution) at all potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. E</xref>). The &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> upon washing out Ca<sup>2+</sup> was voltage dependent and was fit by a single exponential. The current turned off more slowly at more positive potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. D</xref>). In a different patch, when the solution was switched from &#x0003c;10 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to 400 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> was much slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. H</xref>), but &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> was very similar to that observed at 40 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> (F and G).</p><p>The mean data from many such experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref>. Although there was some variability among experiments, &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> was independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and was an exponential function of voltage, being greatest at depolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref> A). The plot of &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> versus voltage was quantitatively similar to the plot of &#x003c4;<sub>deact</sub> versus voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> A) for low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The value of <italic>q</italic> estimated from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref> A was 0.26. Both the data from voltage jumps and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration jumps are consistent with deactivation of the current being dominated by a single voltage-dependent step.</p><p>In contrast to the Ca independence of &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub>, &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> was strongly dependent on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]: activation was faster at higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref> B). &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> was voltage independent at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], but became progressively more voltage dependent as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was lowered. Because &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> for a simple two-state model will be equal to 1/&#x003b1; + &#x003b2; (where &#x003b1; is the forward and &#x003b2; is the backward rate constant), as &#x003b1; becomes slower at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> will approach 1/&#x003b2;. Thus, the apparent voltage dependence of &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] can be explained by the voltage dependence of the backward reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Ionic Selectivity of the Channel</title><p>Using two-microelectrode voltage clamp, we have previously shown that both inward (I<sub>Cl2</sub>) and outward (I<sub>Cl1-S</sub> and I<sub>Cl1-T</sub>) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents have the same anionic selectivity sequence (I<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x0003e; Br<sup>&#x02212;</sup> &#x0003e; Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), which is consistent with sequence 1 of Eisenman (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="WrightandDiamond1977">Wright and Diamond 1977</xref>).

Although we questioned whether these differences might be explained by technical artifacts, we also raised the possibility that inward and outward currents might be carried by different species of channels. To examine this idea further, we measured the anionic selectivity of the inward and outward currents in different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in excised patches using the same voltage protocols we used in our two-microelectrode voltage-clamp study (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="KurumaandHartzell1999">Kuruma and Hartzell 1999</xref>).</p><p>Cytosolic Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> was partially replaced with I<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or Br<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and the change in reversal potential of the instantaneous tail currents was measured. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13</xref> shows the effects of changing from Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> to I<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-containing solutions with three different conditions: (a) outward current at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (1 &#x003bc;M), where outward current shows time-dependent activation (mimicking I<sub>Cl1-S</sub>) and inward current is small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13</xref>, A&#x02013;C); (b) outward current at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (2 &#x003bc;M), where both outward and inward currents were fully developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13</xref>, D&#x02013;F); and (c) inward current under the same condition as b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13</xref>, G&#x02013;I).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref> shows simulations of the macroscopic currents using a Monte-Carlo modeling program developed by Dr. Steve Traynelis (Emory University School of Medicine). The currents in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> jumps from &#x0003c;10 nM to 50 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref> A) and 500 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref> B) closely approximate the experimentally recorded currents in both waveform and rectification (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. D</xref>). The &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> and &#x003c4;<sub>on</sub> of the simulated and actual currents are similar (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. F</xref>, with 11, D&#x02013;H). The model also predicts well the currents observed in response to voltage-clamp steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. D</xref>). Simulated currents in excised patches in response to voltage pulses at 50 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref> C) and 500 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (D) also approximate the behavior of the actual currents (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Also, the current&#x02013;voltage relationship shifts from outwardly rectifying to linear within this range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref> G), as was described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>.</p><p>The model is a reasonable approximation to the data, but it fails quantitatively to predict the time course of current deactivation in response to voltage pulses from positive potentials to &#x02212;120 mV at steady 500 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref> E). The kinetics of simulated current deactivation were slower than we observed experimentally. Also, the model predicts that &#x003c4;<sub>off</sub> is somewhat slower for 50 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> than for 500 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which was not observed experimentally. Manipulation of the various rate constants were not able to correct these differences without introducing other discrepancies between the data and the model. Thus, although this gating scheme simulates the general features of the data, it is only a rough approximation. It is possible that rundown may contribute to the differences between the model and the data.</p><p>It was not possible to model the data with schemes in which the forward opening rate constants were voltage sensitive. It was possible to reproduce some of the general features of the actual currents with schemes having fewer states. A simple two-step closed&#x02013;open reaction with the forward rate being Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive and the backward rate being voltage sensitive was able to roughly model the currents, but the quantitative correspondence with the data was not as good as the multistate model presented here.</p></sec><sec><title>Cl Currents Can Be Excitatory or Inhibitory, Depending on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> Signals</title><p>The data in this paper show that, depending on the level of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a single species of Cl channel can behave qualitatively differently. This could be important in excitable cells where, at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], these channels would carry mainly outward current and thus come into play in repolarizing the cell after an excitatory stimulus. In contrast, at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], these channels could also carry inward current at resting potentials below E<sub>Cl</sub> (between &#x02212;30 and &#x02212;60 mV in most excitable cells) and become excitatory. We tested this hypothesis in the oocyte model by examining the ability of IP<sub>3</sub>-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from stores and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to regulate the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was controlled by the heterologously expressed ligand-gated inotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR<sub>3</sub>) that was activated by application of kainic acid under conditions where the only permeant cation present was Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In the absence of activation of iGluR<sub>3</sub>, injection of IP<sub>3</sub> stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from stores and activation of outward current at +40 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. B</xref>). The inward current observed under these conditions was due to slow deactivation of the tail current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15</xref> B): very little steady state inward current was detectable. However, if iGluR<sub>3</sub> was activated with kainic acid to induce a small amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, injection of the same amount of IP<sub>3</sub> now resulted in a large increase in both inward and outward currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15</xref> C). Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was measured in the same oocyte simultaneously by confocal microscopy during the +40 and &#x02212;120 mV voltage-clamp pulses (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MachacaandHartzell1999">Machaca and Hartzell 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15</xref> E). Application of kainic acid caused a small influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, detected as a voltage-dependent increase in fluorescence at &#x02212;120 mV (larger at &#x02212;120 mV where the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was high). Injection of IP<sub>3</sub> then stimulated a voltage-independent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from stores. The small increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx after the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was due to development of store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MachacaandHartzell1999">Machaca and Hartzell 1999</xref>). These data show that altering the basal cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] within a range that has little direct effect on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels can strongly modulate the current produced by a larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and switch the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current from outward only to both inward and outward. Thus, depending on the membrane potential and E<sub>Cl</sub> (which may be modulated by other Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels and transporters), the amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal can result in an excitatory or inhibitory response mediated by the same ion channel.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Gating Mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Channels</title><p>The data presented here are consistent with the gating scheme proposed in <sc>RESULTS</sc> in which Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels exist in multiple closed states having zero to three Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bound. This is supported by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> showing that the relationships between conductance and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are fitted by curves with Hill coefficients between 2.5 and 3.2. The channel cannot open from the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free state (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>0</sub>), because potentials as large as +200 mV do not activate current at &#x0003c;10 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, it is likely that the channel can open from each of the Ca-liganded closed states (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>1</sub> &#x0223c; C<sub>n</sub>). The transition from the closed to open states is virtually voltage independent, as shown by the voltage independence of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref> B). However, the transition from open to closed is voltage sensitive because the deactivation of the current by voltage or Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration jumps is fit by a single exponential and is voltage dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref>). The leftward shift of the conductance&#x02013;voltage curve with increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is explained by the fact that as more channels bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the overall equilibrium is shifted towards open channels. At hyperpolarized potentials, the equilibrium can be shifted towards closed states by increasing the rate constant for channel closing. However, at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], &#x003b2; is slow relative to the opening rates so that voltage has little effect under these conditions.</p><p>This gating scheme is supported by data from other laboratories. <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gomez-Hernandezetal1997">Gomez-Hernandez et al. 1997</xref>, using excised patches from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, showed that activation of the current by Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration jumps at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (1.8 mM and 27 &#x003bc;M) was voltage independent, whereas deactivation was voltage dependent, as we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref> A. But these authors did not examine the kinetics of currents exposed to lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Our data also complement whole-cell data from other laboratories on rat parotid gland cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Arreolaetal1996">Arreola et al. 1996</xref>) and microvascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Niliusetal1997b">Nilius et al. 1997b</xref>). Both of these laboratories perfused intact cells with solutions containing different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the whole-cell mode and showed that the channels in these cells were regulated by both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage. Our data differs from theirs in one respect. They find that the Hill coefficient increases with depolarization, but we find that it decreases slightly.</p><p>It is interesting to compare this kinetic scheme with one proposed by <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Cuietal1997">Cui et al. 1997</xref> for the large-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K (BK) channel. There are several fundamental differences between BK channel gating and our gating model of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel. First, the BK channel exhibits intrinsic voltage dependence and can be opened by voltage in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or closed by voltage in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This is not true of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel because the opening rate constant is not voltage sensitive. Because the voltage dependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel results from the voltage dependence of the closing rate, the channel obviously cannot be opened in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by altering the closing rate constant. Likewise, in the presence of Ca<sup>2</sup>+, there will always be an equilibrium level of open states, regardless of the value of &#x003b2;(V). Thus, voltage will not be capable of completely turning off the current.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms of Regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Channels</title><p>There remains considerable uncertainty about whether Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels are activated by direct binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, by binding of calmodulin (CaM) or other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins, or by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymatic modification (phosphorylation/dephosphorylation). Some channels can be stably activated in excised patches by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Frizzelletal1986">Frizzell et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Takahashietal1987">Takahashi et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Martin1993">Martin 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Collieretal1996">Collier et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gomez-Hernandezetal1997">Gomez-Hernandez et al. 1997</xref>), suggesting that channels might be regulated directly by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the channel. In other experiments, however, channel activity runs down quickly after excision, suggesting the possibility that components in addition to Ca<sup>2+</sup> are required to open the channel (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="N0x2947910N0x29223f0">Kl&#x000f6;ckner 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="MorrisandFrizzell1993">Morris and Frizzell 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="VanRenterghemandLazdunski1993">VanRenterghem and Lazdunski 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="LargeandWang1996">Large and Wang 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="SchlenkerandFitz1996">Schlenker and Fitz 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Niliusetal1997a">Nilius et al. 1997a</xref>). In our experiments, the currents often ran down, in contrast to what has been reported by some other labs on the same preparation (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Gomez-Hernandezetal1997">Gomez-Hernandez et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Takahashietal1987">Takahashi et al. 1987</xref>). However, the possibility exists that in the experiments of these other labs, rundown had already occurred before recording began.</p><p>It has been shown that some types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl currents require Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylation for activation. A role for CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation in the activation of certain Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents has been suggested because the currents are inhibited by KN62 or a CaMKII-inhibitor peptide (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Nishimotoetal1991">Nishimoto et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Tohdaetal1991">Tohda et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Wagneretal1991">Wagner et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="WorrellandFrizzell1991">Worrell and Frizzell 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="MorrisandFrizzell1993">Morris and Frizzell 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Schumannetal1993">Schumann et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Chanetal1994">Chan et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="BraunandSchulman1995">Braun and Schulman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Chaoetal1995">Chao et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Xieetal1996">Xie et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Arreolaetal1998">Arreola et al. 1998</xref>). CaMKII, however, is apparently not required for activation of all kinds of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl channels: a recent study showed that, although macroscopic currents in parotid gland and T84 intestinal cells are very similar, the currents in T84 cells are inhibited by CaMKII inhibitors, whereas the currents in parotid cells are not (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Arreolaetal1998">Arreola et al. 1998</xref>). These differences could possibly be explained by differences in the activity of protein phosphatases in the different cell types or to differences in the regulation of different kinds of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl channels. To make the situation more complicated, in smooth muscle cells, CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation inhibits channel activity (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="WangandKotlikoff1997">Wang and Kotlikoff 1997</xref>) and in A6 kidney cells alkaline phosphatase (presumably via protein dephosphorylation) increases inward currents (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="MarunakaandEaton1990">Marunaka and Eaton 1990</xref>).</p><p>The experiments we present here show clearly that the channel can be activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the absence of ATP and thus show that the transition from the closed to the open state is not tightly coupled to phosphorylation and is probably due to direct Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to a channel subunit. The rundown phenomenon, however, could be due to dephosphorylation of channels that are phosphorylated before the patch is excised, but if this is the case, phosphorylation would only make the channel competent to be opened by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and would not open the channel directly.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological Significance</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels are certainly less well understood than cation channels or some other anion channels, such as CFTR, &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid receptors, or the ClC family (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="JentshandGunther1997">Jentsh and Gunther 1997</xref>). Nevertheless, it is clear that these channels are found in many cell types and play important roles in many tissues, including smooth muscle and epithelia (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="LargeandWang1996">Large and Wang 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Morris1999">Morris 1999</xref>).</p><p>These data have a number of important physiological implications. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg, sperm entry during fertilization turns on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels as a consequence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores. Opening these channels produces a transient depolarization of the egg cell membrane (the &#x0201c;fertilization potential&#x0201d;) to prevent polyspermy (the so-called &#x0201c;fast block to polyspermy&#x0201d;) (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="WebbandNuccitelli1985">Webb and Nuccitelli 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="JaffeandCross1986">Jaffe and Cross 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="FontanillaandNuccitelli1998">Fontanilla and Nuccitelli 1998</xref>). Our data predicts that increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] above 1 &#x003bc;M would be required to produce the fertilization potential because the strong outward rectification of the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current at lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] would strongly limit the inward current required for depolarization. This expectation is supported by measurements showing that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at the membrane reaches &#x0223c;1.2 &#x003bc;M after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="FontanillaandNuccitelli1998">Fontanilla and Nuccitelli 1998</xref>). Because the membrane potential of the egg is determined almost entirely by Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> conductance, the voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels in the egg may serve the rather simple function of ensuring a high Ca<sup>2+</sup> threshold for activation of the fast block to polyspermy. The fertilization potential is transient and lasts only &#x0223c;15 min. As Ca<sup>2+</sup> declines with time after fertilization, the outward rectification of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current may assist in repolarization of the membrane.</p><p>This difference in behavior of the channel at different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] explains the complex behavior of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, which we have previously described. We have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Hartzell1996">Hartzell 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="KurumaandHartzell1999">Kuruma and Hartzell 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="MachacaandHartzell1999">Machaca and Hartzell 1999</xref>) that there are two different macroscopic currents in these cells. One current (I<sub>Cl2</sub>) is activated selectively by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, whereas the other (I<sub>Cl1-S</sub> and I<sub>Cl1-T</sub>) is activated both by influx and release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from stores. We have confirmed that in oocytes without a vitelline membrane, these same currents develop in response to IP<sub>3</sub> injection (data not shown). Although we have been ambivalent as to whether these different macroscopic currents are mediated by the same or different types of channels, we now feel confident that we can explain the currents by a single species of channel that is gated by the mechanisms described in this paper. The combination of different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations provided by Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from stores (lower concentration) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (higher concentration) coupled with the voltage sensitivity of the channel at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] can generate complex macroscopic currents. This adds a new dimension to how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals may be interpreted by cells.</p><p>In excitable cells where the membrane potential regularly oscillates above and below E<sub>Cl</sub> due to other conductances, these different behaviors of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels at different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] could have very interesting consequences. For example, in some species, such as rabbit, an outward Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current normally plays a role in phase 1 repolarization of the cardiac action potential (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="ZygmuntandGibbons1992">Zygmunt and Gibbons 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zygmunt1994">Zygmunt 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Pappetal1995">Papp et al. 1995</xref>). However, under conditions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, this same channel may produce transient inward currents that are arrhythmogenic (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="JanuaryandFozzard1988">January and Fozzard 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Berlinetal1989">Berlin et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bib" rid="Zygmuntetal1998">Zygmunt et al. 1998</xref>). This Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel in rabbit heart has many features including single channel conductance (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Collieretal1996">Collier et al. 1996</xref>) and anionic selectivity (<xref ref-type="bib" rid="Kawanoetal1995">Kawano et al. 1995</xref>) in common with the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte channel. Thus, the voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channels place these channels in a pivotal role for regulation of cellular excitability.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Steve Traynelis for extensive madvice and discussion and for help with the modeling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>, and we thank Drs.

BACE1 expression is regulated at the transcriptional, as well as post-transcriptional level. Very high BACE1 mRNA levels have been observed in pancreas, but the protein and activity were found mainly in brain. An up-regulation of the protein has been described in some AD patients without a change in transcript levels. The features of BACE1 5&#x02032; untranslated region (5<bold>&#x02032;</bold> UTR), such as the length, GC content, evolutionary conservation and presence of upstream AUGs (uAUGs), indicate an important regulatory role of this 5&#x02032; UTR in translational control. We demonstrate that, in brain and pancreas, almost all of the native BACE1 mRNA contains the full-length 5&#x02032; UTR. RNA transfection and <italic>in vitro</italic> translation show that translation is mainly inhibited by the presence of the uAUGs. We provide a mutational analysis that highlight the second uAUG as the main inhibitory element while mutations of all four uAUGs fully de-repress translation. Furthermore, we have evidence that a sequence within the region 222-323 of the BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR has a stimulatory effect on translation that might depend on the presence of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>BACE1 (&#x003b2;-site APP cleaving enzyme 1) is a type 1 membrane-associated aspartyl protease of 501 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). BACE1 is required for the processing of neuregulin 1 type III, an EGF-like factor that activates the EGF receptor in Schwann cells, thereby regulating the myelination of axons in the peripheral and central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In addition to neuregulin 1, other BACE1 substrates have been identified, such as the amyloid-&#x003b2; precursor-like proteins 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), the ST6 &#x003b2;-galactosamide &#x003b1;-2,6-sialyltranferase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), the selectin P ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), the &#x003b2; subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Historically, BACE1 has been discovered as the secretase that cleaves the amyloid-&#x003b2; precursor protein (APP) at the &#x003b2;-site. In order to generate the amyloid-&#x003b2; peptide (A&#x003b2;), APP has to be cleaved sequentially by BACE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>) and the &#x003b3;-secretase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) at the &#x003b2;- and the &#x003b3;-site, respectively. A&#x003b2; is the major component of the senile plaques, the histological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progressive accumulation has been causally linked to neuronal impairment and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>BACE1 shows a tissue-specific expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Post-transcriptional mechanisms must also play an important role as shown by the lack of correlation between mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that BACE1 protein expression was up-regulated in the brain of some sporadic AD patients without changes in the level of the corresponding mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28">25&#x02013;28</xref>), thereby suggesting that these mechanisms can play a pathogenic role.</p><p>In addition to transcription, regulation of gene expression can be achieved by mRNA processing, transport, localization and stability. Translation of mRNA can also be regulated typically by sequences within the untranslated regions (UTRs) and/or by interactions between the mRNA and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, such as RNA-binding proteins or micro RNAs (miRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). These interactions are usually inhibitory and often interfere with the initiation step of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>Protein translation in eukaryotes is predominantly initiated by a cap-dependent scanning mechanism in which the small ribosomal subunits, with the associated translational initiation factors, are recruited to the 5&#x02032; cap structure and scan in a 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; orientation until the first AUG is recognized. Then, the large ribosomal subunit joins the complex to initiate the protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In eukaryotes, recognition of an AUG as a translation start codon critically depends on its surrounding sequence. For mammals, the consensus sequence GCC<bold>A/G</bold>CC<underline>AUG</underline><bold>G</bold> provides an optimal context for initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), with the purine at position &#x02212;3 and the G at position +4 being the most important nucleotides. The rate of initiation is strongly influenced by the primary and secondary structure of mRNAs. Two mechanisms for escaping the first-AUG rule, i.e. context-dependent leaky scanning and re-initiation, enable downstream AUG codons to be accessed in some mRNAs via scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Leaky scanning is the process in which a small ribosomal subunit can bypass an upstream AUG (uAUG) in a poor context and reach a downstream AUG codon that is in stronger context for translational initiation. Re-initiation of translation occurs when, after translation of an uORF, the small ribosomal subunit is not released from the mRNA but resumes scanning. Having re-acquired the necessary translational initiation factors, it can re-initiate translation at a downstream AUG. There are also some reports pointing towards a rare viral mechanism, known as ribosome shunting, in which the small ribosomal subunit binds the mRNA in 5&#x02032; cap-dependent manner and scans downstream until it reaches a stable RNA secondary structure, which is bypassed due to shunting to a downstream-landing site where the scanning is continued till the start AUG codon is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Another way to initiate translation implies a cap-independent mechanism that requires an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and has been extensively described for some viral transcripts and a few cellular transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37">35&#x02013;37</xref>).</p><p>Genes for potent regulatory proteins, such as cytokines, growth factors, kinases, transcription factors, etc., often produce mRNAs in which the 5&#x02032; UTR is GC rich and/or burdened by uAUG codons. The idea that these encumbered sequences are nature's way of limiting the synthesis of proteins that would be harmful if overproduced, is supported by experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>The 5&#x02032; UTR of BACE1 mRNA is long, evolutionally conserved, has a high GC content and four uAUGs, all features that suggest the potential of translational regulation. Indeed, two recent studies have demonstrated that BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR is inhibitory to translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). However, they differ in the interpretation of the data, with one report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) favoring a major role of uAUGs, while the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) suggests that the GC-rich region of the 5&#x02032; UTR forms a translation barrier that prevents the ribosome from efficiently translating the BACE1 mRNA. In addition, a third article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) suggests that a shunting mechanism can overcome the translational inhibition by BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR in a cell-specific manner. Therefore, the mechanism of down-regulation of translation driven by BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR remains controversial.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of inhibition of translation of BACE1 transcript by dissecting and mutating its 5&#x02032; UTR. We employed RNA transfection to avoid possible artifacts arising from transcriptional or splicing effects that might occur with DNA transfection. RNA transfection experiments were also compared with <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assays to highlight the possible contribution of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. By this approach, we demonstrate that the translational control of BACE1 expression is mainly limited by the presence of uAUGs rather than a major contribution from structural determinants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Reagents and media for cell culture were provided from Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ, USA.

The riboprobe was designed to protect most of the transcript leader and 166&#x02009;nt of the main open reading frame (ORF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The full-length BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR was expected to protect a fragment of 536&#x02009;nt, while the putative alternatively spliced variant was expected to protect a fragment of 403&#x02009;nt. Total RNA from human brain and pancreas was first loaded on an agarose gel to confirm that both RNA preparations are of comparable quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). These RNAs were incubated with the BACE1 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled riboprobe alone or with a mixture containing the BACE1 riboprobe and a GAPDH riboprobe. An estimated 3&#x02013;10 molar excess of the probe was used to avoid saturation and the higher signal from GADPH riboprobe in brain was considered an internal control of the procedure. In all reactions, only the band corresponding to the BACE1 full-length 5&#x02032; UTR was detected, questioning the existence of different BACE1 transcript leaders under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Interestingly, the intensity of the signal protected by the BACE1 riboprobe was comparable in both tissues and quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that BACE1 mRNA is expressed in both tissues almost at the same level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).

Since it was previously reported that some regions of the BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR might have promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), we employed a RNA transfection assay and <italic>in vitro</italic> translation analysis, techniques that allow exclusively monitoring of translation, hence avoiding putative transcriptional/post-transcriptional effects such as cryptic promoter activity and RNA splicing.</p><p>To identify regions of the BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR involved in translational regulation, we generated the deletion variants described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A. These constructs were used to prepare <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed reporter mRNAs with the firefly luciferase ORF, containing a 5&#x02032; m<sup>7</sup>GpppG cap structure and a poly(A) tail of 98 A-residues. Firefly mRNAs together with a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase control reporter mRNA were used either in RNA-transfection experiments in HeLa cells or in an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assay based on HeLa cell extracts. Deletion mutants showed a similar trend in both systems, although the effect on translation was more pronounced <italic>in vivo</italic> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). The 5&#x02032;-half of the sequence (1-218) bearing three out of four uAUGs manifests a clear translational repression that is even stronger <italic>in vivo</italic> (compare T3A-B1 and 1-218 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). This enhanced repression might be ascribed to the fact that this construct lacks the putative stop codon of the uORF that originates from the second uAUG. This creates an out-of-frame overlap of that uORF with the main ORF, thereby enhancing the possibility that the ribosomal scanning misses the start codon of the reporter gene. Surprisingly, the 3&#x02032;-half of the sequence (222-455) did not show any repression (compare T3A-B1 and 222-455 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). Since it has been previously reported that the 3&#x02032;-half of the BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR might have strong inhibitory effect via highly structured regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), we performed a more detailed deletion analysis of this region by generating constructs 323-455 and 395-455 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Interestingly, the reporter mRNA-bearing region 323-455 showed again an inhibitory effect that was more evident <italic>in vitro</italic> when compared with the full-length reporter, while the 395-455 reporters did not show any significant inhibitory effect as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C, compare T3A-B1 with 323-455 and 395-455). These effects on translational efficiency could not be explained by differences in mRNA stability, since qPCR analysis shows that the transcripts are equally stable under given conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D and E). The <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of deletion mutants reveals that the BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR represses translation by sequence elements that are mainly present in the first half of the sequence. Interestingly, in addition to those regulatory elements, the deletion analysis revealed a possible presence of a translational activator: the comparison of translation efficiency of reporter mRNAs bearing the region 222-455 and 323-455 suggests a possible positive effect on translation by the intermediate region 222-323.

According to Kozak's model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), the first uAUG in BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR is in an optimal context for translational initiation, since it contains a purine at position &#x02212;3, and a G at position +4; however, an U at position +5 can reduce this optimal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46 B47 B48">46&#x02013;48</xref>). The third and fourth uAUGs contain pyrimidines at both positions &#x02212;3 and +4 and therefore are not likely to be in an optimal context for efficient translation initiation. The context of the second uAUG has a G at position &#x02212;3, and a pyrimidine at position +4, thus, it is in a good, but not optimal context for translation initiation.

Translation of this reporter <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> gave surprising results since this mutation (mut 2) diminished translational repression from &#x0223c;14 to &#x0223c;2-fold <italic>in vivo</italic>, and it was enough to completely bypass translational repression <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and C, compare T3A-B1 and mut 2), suggesting that the second uAUG indeed is efficiently recognized. Additional mutation of the first and the third uAUG increased further translational efficiency, but at least <italic>in vivo</italic>, the increase was very modest when compared with the effect of the mutation of the second uAUG alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and C, compare T3A-B1 with mut 2, mut 1,2 and mut 1,2,3). The role of the fourth uAUG was intriguing, since the deletion mutant that starts in its close proximity (323-455) showed a lower translational efficiency than the reporter mRNAs bearing the putative positive regulatory element (i.e. 222-455), suggesting that this uAUG may contribute to the translational repression. However, mutation of this uAUG alone did not have any significant impact on translational efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and C, compare T3A-B1 and mut 4). Nonetheless, mutation of the fourth uAUG in addition to the second uAUG increased additionally translational efficiency compared with the effect of the mutated second uAUG alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and C, compare mut 2 with mut 2,4).</p><p>When we mutated all four uAUGs, the translational efficiency was 2&#x02013;4-fold higher than control, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and C, see mut #4), in spite of the fact that the BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR has a very high GC content and a strong predicted secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that the good translatability of the BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR without uAUGs could be due to the presence of the positive regulatory element in the region 222-323. This region could play a role in re-initiation efficiency by acting as a spacer between the end of the translation of the uORF and the beginning of the main ORF and/or because of the sequence that surround the stop codon of the uORF. Therefore, we evaluated the role of the region 222-323 in translational regulation in the context of both the wild-type BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR, in order to appreciate its effect on re-initiation, and the 5&#x02032; UTR without uAUGs. We generated a number of additional mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), which were used in both experimental systems, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The translational efficiency driven by the region 222-323 alone was &#x0223c;3-fold higher when compared to the control mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C, see 222-323). This effect was also analyzed in the context of the full-length BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR. In RNA-transfection experiments, deletion of the 222-323 region led to an additional decrease in translational efficiency (&#x0223c;4-fold when compared with the wild-type sequence) down to &#x0223c;60-fold below control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, see &#x00394;222-323 and compare with T3A-B1). Replacement in antisense orientation led to further decrease of translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, see 222-323as), showing that also the primary sequence plays an important role. Interestingly, deletion or antisense orientation of the region 222-323 in the context of full-length BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR did not influence translation of the reporter gene in experiments performed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C).

Deletion of this region revealed a decrease in translational efficiency, (3-fold <italic>in vivo</italic> and 2-fold <italic>in vitro</italic>), indicating that the positive effect of the region 222-323 on translation is, at least partially, uAUG independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, compare mut #4 with mut #4 &#x00394;222-323, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>), i.e. not only due to the positive effect that this sequence may exert on re-initiation efficiency. Although the decrease in translation might look similar in the two conditions (4-fold when uAUGs are present and 3-fold when absent), it would be difficult to compare those values due to the different translation efficiency of the corresponding controls (T3A-B1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and mut #4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Therefore, further investigation is needed to assess the precise extent of uAUG-dependent and -independent effects. One possible explanation for the uAUG-independent positive effect of this region could be that it can act as an IRES. However, the IRES activity within this region was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). Furthermore, we wanted to test if there is a specific interaction between RNA-binding protein(s) and the region 222-323 in an electro-mobility shift assay. Under the standard experimental conditions we applied, we could not detect specific interactions, possibly due to the high GC content of BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR (data not shown). Further testing is required to evaluate the presence of any <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor able to bind this region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that BACE1 translation is inhibited by uAUGs in its 5&#x02032; UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Other studies suggested different mechanisms involving inhibition by highly structured regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and the possibility to bypass inhibitory regions in a cell-specific way by ribosomal shunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). To shed more light on the molecular mechanism of translational regulation of BACE1, we performed a detailed analysis of its 5&#x02032; UTR.</p><p>We have previously reported an alternative splicing within BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Since spliced forms of the 5&#x02032; UTR of mRNAs have been reported to control protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), we re-evaluated our findings. However, the data obtained in this study question the existence of BACE1 5&#x02032; UTRs different from the full-length form under normal physiological conditions.</p><p>In the previous report, we used the MVA-T7pol vaccinia virus expression system, a strategy that allows the transcription of gene of interest to occur solely in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). In spite of this, the robust transcription and translation in cytosol driven by the virus can override the physiological mechanisms of translational regulation. For this reason, we preferred to use RNA transfection and <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assay in this study, i.e. techniques that mimic better the physiological conditions and should, in principle, allow us to monitor exclusively translational regulation and avoiding the interference of transcriptional or additional post-transcriptional events.</p><p>The BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR has a GC content of 77% and it is predicted to form very strong secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Secondary structures can play an important role in translational regulation. A hairpin structure with a free energy &#x0003c;&#x02212;30&#x02009;kcal/mol situated close to the cap structure can impede scanning by interfering with the binding of the small ribosomal subunit complex to the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), while a hairpin with a free energy &#x0003c;&#x02212;50&#x02009;kcal/mol can inhibit scanning of the small ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50 B51 B52">50&#x02013;52</xref>). In the case of BACE1, our results clearly imply that the high GC content of BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR, predicted to represent a constitutive translational barrier, does not hinder the scanning process of the small ribosomal subunit complex as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Instead, our data suggest that uAUGs fully account for the observed inhibition of BACE1 translation. It is noteworthy that we mutated uAUGs into UUGs, i.e. we changed a purine with a pyrimidine. Even though this kind of substitution might produce subtle structural changes in the transcript, it is unlikely that such mutations (as in case of the second uAUG) would abolish a very strong secondary structure that does not allow the small ribosomal subunit to go through. Indeed, bioinformatic tools (such as MFOLD) did not predict any significant structural change upon these substitutions.</p><p>The progressive rescue of BACE1 translation by cumulative uAUG mutations also questions a possible shunting mechanism in which the small ribosomal complex could bypass inhibitory segments of the 5&#x02032; UTR. In our analysis, instead, the contribution of all uAUGs to translational efficiency, with the strongest impact of the second uAUG, is more consistent with the scanning model of translational initiation. The possibility that shunting might affect BACE1 levels in pathological conditions is certainly intriguing, but it would require further investigation.</p><p>The presence of uAUGs is usually inhibitory to translation of the main ORF. uORFs can regulate mRNA stability and translational efficiency in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Our stability assay on deletion-containing mRNA reporters suggests that the 5&#x02032; UTR of BACE1 does not affect translation efficiency by changes in stability of the mRNA. More notably, the mutational analysis of uAUGs shows that all four uAUGs affect translation, but to a different extent, being the second uAUG efficiently recognized, while the others probably skipped by leaky scanning. Interestingly, to make the construct 1-218, we deleted the last nucleotide in the stop codon of the second uORF, thereby we created an out of frame, overlapping uORF. Efficient recognition of the second uAUG (or even the third in-frame uAUG) and translation of one of these newly created overlapping uORF(s) could explain the observed low translational efficiency of this reporter mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. The rescue due to mutation of the second uAUG revealed that it is efficiently recognized, and the low-translational efficiency of construct 1-218, indeed, could be ascribed to the translation of the newly created overlapping uORF. Taking together these results, we propose that BACE1 translation is mainly limited by the low re-initiation frequency after translation of the second uORF, while leaky scanning of the other uAUGs seems rather efficient and does not give a major contribution to the translational inhibition of BACE1. These data on the key role of the second uAUG are consistent with a recent report on the same subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), while the different results obtained by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) might be explained by taking into account that the high GC content of the BACE1 5&#x02032; UTR hides a cryptic promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) that, albeit weak, might influence results in certain conditions or in specific cell types.</p><p>For the process of re-initiation, the length and the nucleotide sequence between the termination codon of the translated uORF and the downstream initiation site can be critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Re-initiation can be influenced by the nucleotide sequence around the termination codon, up to 12&#x02009;nt downstream. The decrease in translational efficiency observed upon deletion of the 222-323 region might indicate the importance of this region as a spacer between the translated uORF and the downstream AUG. On the other hand, the construct with the 222-323 region in antisense orientation showed an even stronger translational repression suggesting that the primary sequence of this region play a more important role than just as spacer for the process of re-initiation, i.e. it could function as positive element by keeping high the re-initiation efficiency, acting at the level of the termination event of the uORF. Together with the stimulation of translation obtained with the 222-323 construct, these results highlight this region as an element that might act positively in <italic>cis</italic> on the transcript and/or as a binding site for positive <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. Further work will address this issue in light of the higher translation efficiency that has been detected in primary neuronal cultures when compared with other cell types, and considering the increase in translation efficiency that can be obtained in astrocytes upon activation with cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Furthermore, even if our data are not in favor of a specific model to explain the striking difference in BACE1 translation between human brain and pancreas, they keep open the two most notable possibilities, i.e. the expression in pancreas of high levels of a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor (either a protein or a miRNA) that inhibits translation of BACE1, and the existence in brain of a regulator/mechanism that allows a partial skipping of the uAUG block occurring in the other tissues. The presence of multiple variants of the BACE1 transcript, ascribed to alternative polyadenylation signals, may add further complexity to this scenario.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>M.M. was guest in Hentze's laboratory for a year and thanks the other members of the lab for useful discussions and help.

Electrophoretic banding patterns of a plasmid (pHZ209), reflecting DNA degradation, displayed a clear change from a preferential modification site in strain 1326 to more random modifications in the mutant. Fourteen randomly modifiable sites on pHZ209 were localized, and each seemed to be able to be modified only once. Residues in a region (5&#x02032;-c&#x02013;cGGCCgccg-3&#x02032;) including a highly conserved 4-bp central core (5&#x02032;-GGCC-3&#x02032;) in a well-documented preferential modification site were assessed for their necessity by site-directed mutagenesis. While the central core (GGCC) was found to be stringently required in 1326 and in the mutant, &#x02018;gccg&#x02019; flanking its right could either abolish or reduce the modification frequency only in the mutant, and two separate nucleotides to the left had no dramatic effect. The lack of essentiality of DndB for S-modification suggests that it might only be required for enhancing or stabilizing the activity of a protein complex at the required preferential modification site, or resolving secondary structures flanking the modifiable site(s), known to constitute an obstacle for efficient modification.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A novel DNA sulfur modification was found in the soil-dwelling, antibiotic-producing bacteria <italic>Streptomyces lividans</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces avermitilis</italic>. Three distinctive features were associated with the modification: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) Tris-dependent DNA degradation occurred during normal or pulse-field gel electrophoresis (the Dnd phenotype); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) the Dnd phenotype did not seem to be inhibited by treatment with formaldehyde, proteinase K and/or lysozyme; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) the Dnd phenotype could be repressed if the electrophoretic buffer was supplemented with a small amount of reducing agents, especially those containing sulfur, like thiourea, or if Tris was replaced by Hepes in the electrophoresis buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6">1&#x02013;6</xref>). The Dnd phenotype and its inhibition in the presence of thiourea were not limited to the above-mentioned two <italic>Streptomyces</italic> strains, but found in a large array of gram-positive and -negative bacteria such as <italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>), <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), <italic>Pseudomonas flurensences</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> and <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), although in most cases the phenomenon has been interpreted as nuclease contamination in the DNA samples. Gene clusters rendering Dnd phenotype had been identified in <italic>S. lividans</italic>, <italic>S. avermitilis</italic>, and many of the above-mentioned microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, and X. He <italic>et al</italic>., submitted for publication).</p><p>The DNA sulfur modification is site specific, as well as post-replicative because single-stranded plasmid replication intermediates do not seem to contain the modification sites, as evidenced from primer extension experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The dsDNA modifications occur at the first guanine residues within a 6-bp palindromic core sequence of cGgccg, as elegently identified by Dyson <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Three independent pairs of a 13-bp direct repeat flanking both sides of the modified site were also recognized to be important for the modification process. Deletion of either the leftmost or the rightmost repeat abolished the modification, whose site lies within the central repeat sequence, while deletion of the left-hand repeat changed the modification to other sites on plasmid pIJ101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we reported that the <italic>dnd</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) of <italic>S. lividans</italic> 1326 is directly involved in the DNA modification process that incorporates sulfur into specific sites of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), although the precise chemical nature of the modification remains obscure. Experiments including the use of gene disruption and gain and/or loss of function techniques showed that the five genes in the <italic>dnd</italic> locus are all essential for the DNA sulfur modification. Of these, DndA, DndC, DndD and DndE showed remarkable similarities to cysteine desulfurase, PAPS reductase, chromosome segregation protein and phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase, respectively. While DndB showed 25% identity and 38% similarity to ABC transporter ATPase from <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> sp. SKA58 (ZP_01303985), and 26% similarity to a DNA gyrase (GyrB) from <italic>Mycoplasma putrefaciens</italic> it is also noticeable that the predicted DndB is likely to be a basic protein (pI: 8.79) under physiological conditions and would conceivably bind nucleic acids. Indeed, this feature was implied by the fact that the Dnd phenotype was significantly aggravated in a <italic>dnd</italic>B<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant, reflecting a relaxed preference for modification sites on DNA. Here, we describe an altered Dnd phenotype in a <italic>dnd</italic>B<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant, and its subsequent use for the convenient and detailed characterization of the consensus sequence on a pIJ101-derived plasmid, pHZ209, containing a well-characterized preferential modification site. This resulted in a clear demonstration that a consensus sequence with a 4-bp central core is highly conserved and required for modification, but the requirement of its flanking sequences differs remarkably in DndB-deficient strain, HXY2. DndB was implicated as an important mediator for the efficiency of DNA modification.

Briefly, PCR amplification using a fixed primer (UP1) designed upstream of an EcoRI site leftward to the nucleotides to be mutated (i.e. nucleotides upstream of 2374&#x02013;2385) and variable primers (DP2 series, depending on the site to be mutated) would generate a Step Ia product (725&#x02009;bp). Meanwhile, PCR amplification using variable primers (UP3 series, depending on the site to be mutated) and a fixed primer (DP4) designed downstream of an XhoI site rightward to the nucleotides to be mutated (i.e. nucleotides downstream of 2374&#x02013;2385) would generate a Step Ib product (502&#x02009;bp). A mixture of the Step Ia and Ib products (with a 40-bp overlap between the 3&#x02032;-end of Ia and the 5&#x02032;-end of Ib, to provide mutual priming) was used as templates in a subsequent PCR amplification using two fixed primers (UP1 and DP4) to yield the Step II product (1187&#x02009;bp). On digestion with EcoRI and XhoI, fragments of identical size (949&#x02009;bp) but variable mutations along 5&#x02032;-cGGCCgccg-3&#x02032; were ligated into the corresponding sites of pBluescript II SK(+), to obtain transient plasmids in <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B. Their EcoRI&#x02013;XhoI fragments were recovered from agarose gels and cloned into the corresponding sites of pHZ209 after digestion with the same enzymes (EcoRI and XhoI), so that the fragment of the same size was conveniently replaced. All the replaced fragments in pHZ209 derivatives were sequenced to confirm the desired mutation at specific nucleotide positions before protoplast transformation of <italic>S. lividans</italic> 1326 and its mutants HXY2 and HXY6 to test the effect of each mutation on modification specificity.

The great majority of the pHZ209 DNA in both lanes, pHZ209/1326 and pHZ209/HXY2, remained stable as a 5413-bp non-degraded and linearized pHZ209, as originally loaded in lane pHZ209/HXY6, suggesting that not all of the pHZ209 DNA molecules were modified, in agreement with the early report by Zhou <italic>et al</italic>.

This suggested that the plasmid molecule is not further modified in other positions once the preferential site is modified. If this site were the only one that could be modified <italic>in vivo</italic>, no other degradation bands should be observed.</p><p>This is obviously not the case as we saw many additional bands resulting from the cleavage of pHZ209, in either 1326 or HXY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) at other positions. This prompted us to attempt sequencing of as many as possible of the additional fragments with modified termini originating from degraded pHZ209 in HXY2.</p><p>A total of 141 clones were obtained after EcoRV-linearized pHZ209 was treated with activated Tris-buffer to cleave the modified site before insertion into SmaI-digested pBluescript SK(+), and subjected to multiple restriction enzyme analysis (data not shown). Thirty-three clones equal in size to that of linearized pHZ209 (ca 5.4&#x02009;kb) (three of which were confirmed to be linearized pHZ209 by sequencing from both termini), and 15 clones with inserts larger than 5.4&#x02009;kb (and so carrying multiple fragments), were disregarded. Forty-eight of the 93 remaining clones, which were obviously smaller than linearized pHZ209 (5.4&#x02009;kb), were selected for sequencing from both termini. Apart from one clone that seemed to derive from degradation of contaminating chromosome DNA, 41 clones each contained a contiguous piece of pHZ209 DNA, clearly derived from degradation at a single site, and the other six clones contained rearranged DNA fragments resulting from ligation of at least two degraded pHZ209 fragments.</p><p>The terminal sequences resulting from ligation of a single DNA fragment among 24 clones could be mapped to 16 positions relative to the unique reference site (EcoRV) on pHZ209. A preliminary assembly of the end positions of 14 sequence reads indeed first revealed an obvious sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) conforming to the site identified by Dyson <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), although the two modified nucleotides on opposite strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) seemed to be adjacent rather than separated by two bases within the consensus region as originally identified by experiments involving <italic>in vitro</italic> Tris-activation and PCR (see Discussion). However, 17 independent sequence reads did not conform to the consensus sequence (not shown) but matched totally random nucleotide positions on pHZ209, in sharp contrast to those sequence reads leading to the assembly of the consensus sequence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, some of which had been sequenced more than once using random and independent clones from the same cloning experiment.</p><p>In an attempt to discover whether all the sequence reads, or only those conforming to the consensus sequence, represented genuine modifiable sites, we repeated the above cloning experiment using EcoRV-linearized pHZ209 isolated from HXY6 (a strain with complete deletion of the <italic>dnd</italic> gene cluster, hence without modified DNA). Indeed, 24 multiple clones were obtained, but none of the sequence reads from them corresponded to consensus sequences, and none of them matched the sequences from the random and independent clones generated in the earlier experiment, suggesting that they were &#x02018;noise&#x02019; sequences generated by non-specific and physical breakage of DNA fragments during the cloning process involving <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with activated Tris-buffer and exonuclease III.</p><p>In order to confirm that mapped modifiable sites on pHZ209 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) originating from the above assembled consensus sequence were meaningful, thus ruling out non-specific noise, we sequenced DNA fragments from some additional isolatable specific bands from degraded pHZ209 in HXY2 after cloning into pGEM-T in the same way as we had done for one of the two most intense bands (3034&#x02009;bp) of pHZ209 from 1326 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Four bands were chosen (4R, 5R, 6R and 9R, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), whose sizes added up to 5.4&#x02009;kb, equivalent to the total size of pHZ209. (Sequencing of other fragment pairs was unsuccessful, mainly because different DNA fragments of the same size were recovered for cloning, which resulted in co-transformation influencing the sequencing reads.) Consistently, the distribution of these sequence reads, which were sure to have resulted from the Dnd phenotype, could be easily localized at positions 4, 5, 6 and 9, respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, conforming to the same sites for the generation of the consensus sequence as from the shotgun cloning into pBluescript M13(+) described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).</p><p>The common consensus sequence generated from either a shotgun cloning of a mixture of fragments [into pBluescript SK(+)] or from the targeted cloning of specific fragments (into pGEM-T) clearly suggested that each degraded DNA fragment originated from specific cleavage of the plasmid, which had been modified at different modifiable positions, and that each pHZ209 molecule is modified not more than once, even though multiple sites are available for modification. To further prove this, we analyzed the specific banding patterns of the two specifically degraded fragments from pJTU2031 linearized with three restriction enzymes on which the recognition sites are all unique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). [pJTU2031 is a pHZ209 derivative plasmid with &#x02018;C&#x02019; mutated to &#x02018;A&#x02019; at nucleotide 2374 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), resulting in a reduced intensity of the two specific bands compared with those caused by preferential modification in pHZ209]. Modification at position 10 (L/R), for example, would generate DNA fragments of 4182 and 1231&#x02009;bp if pJTU2031 (or pHZ209) was linearized with EcoRV. The banding profile was assumed to change into one with 3027 and 2386, 3976 and 1437, 4687 and 726&#x02009;bp bands if pJTU2031 were linearized with EcoRI, XhoI or NdeI, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), as expected (the intensity of the shifted bands varied because occasionally some heterologous fragments of the same sizes migrated together, as detected before in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In fact, nearly all of the degraded DNA fragments seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> could be attributed to cleavage at one specific site of the many on the EcoRV-linearized pJTU2031 (or pHZ209), thus establishing a map with S-modifiable sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In other words, the sizes of any pair of fragments generated by cleavage of linearized pJTU2031 (or pHZ209) at any modifiable site in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> correlated well with the corresponding bands in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> (and/or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), confirming the conclusion that each pJTU2031 (or pHZ209) molecule could be modified either at none or, at most, only one of the multiple modifiable sites, which is also consistent with the routine observation that the cleavage of un-linearized pHZ209 will only generate a concentrated full-size linear fragment together with some un-cleavable circular pHZ209 (not shown), as detected on agarose gels.

We again chose to mutate the site surrounding the preferential recognition sequence 5&#x02032;-cGGCCgccg-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), whose specificity changes could easily be monitored by the intensity changes of the bands of 3.0 and 2.4&#x02009;kb after DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Each of the 9&#x02009;bp in the putative consensus sequence (5&#x02032;-cGGCCgccg-3&#x02032;) was independently changed to an &#x02018;A&#x02019; by three steps of PCR-based sited-directed mutagenesis (see Materials and methods section) before each of the mutated pHZ209 derivatives was independently introduced into 1326 and HXY2, respectively. pHZ209 DNA was then isolated from each transformant in order to detect possible small changes in the Dnd phenotype reflected by variations in DNA banding patterns.</p><p>Both the 3.0- and 2.4-kb bands remained unchanged no matter whether pHZ209 originated from 1326 or HXY2 when the first residue &#x02018;c&#x02019; of the 5&#x02032;-cGGCCgccg-3&#x02032; was mutated to &#x02018;A&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4) as compared with their respective controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2) without mutation. In sharp contrast, each independent change from any one of the following four residues from &#x02018;GGCC&#x02019; to &#x02018;A&#x02019; resulted in complete disappearance of the two DNA bands, no matter whether pHZ209 DNA came from 1326 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 5, 7, 9 and 11) or HXY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 6, 8, 10 and 12). Thus, each of the four residues GGCC was deduced to be equally essential for modification specificity both in 1326 and in HXY2.</p><p>When each of the last four residues &#x02018;gccg&#x02019; was independently mutated to &#x02018;A&#x02019;, the relative intensity of the two corresponding DNA bands did not seem to change if the mutated plasmids came from 1326 (lanes 3, 5, 7 and 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). In contrast, when the plasmid DNA originated from HXY2, the two bands almost disappeared when the first &#x02018;g&#x02019; of the last four residues &#x02018;gccg&#x02019; was mutated to &#x02018;A&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 4), but was &#x0223c;50% reduced for the corresponding change in the third &#x02018;c&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 8), while changes in the second &#x02018;c&#x02019; and the fourth &#x02018;g&#x02019; had little effect (lane 6 and 10 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B), as judged by their scanned band intensities. Thus, while gccg is concluded as non-essential for modification specificity in 1326, the first (g) and the third (c) of the four nucleotides (gccg) is either essential or important in HXY2. As a control, a pHZ209 derivative (pJTU2003) with a &#x02018;c&#x02019; at the third position of the &#x02018;gccg&#x02019; mutated to &#x02018;A&#x02019; in HXY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) could be fully complemented when pHZ1904 carrying the complete <italic>dnd</italic> gene cluster, was integrated into the chromosome of the host strain HXY2, forming LJD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), or partially complemented by pJTU2020 carrying the <italic>dnd</italic>B gene only, forming LJD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>A similar mutation three nucleotides left of the central core (site 2374 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 11) also caused a &#x0223c;40% reduction of the relative modification frequency in HXY2.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The consensus sequence (5&#x02032;-cGGCCgccg-3&#x02032;) identified in this work agrees well with that deduced from analysis of preferential modification sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), although the modified site positions varied by one base pair inward from each side, still at G on both strands. A combination of earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and our current work indicates that the base-pairing between C and modified G, if it still occurs, is probably not as strong as normal G&#x02013;C pairing, and therefore, the primer extension reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) used earlier to localize preferential modification sites could have run off one base before meeting the modified/cleaved site(s), in all cases.</p><p>It is obviously difficult to predict exactly how the five products of the <italic>dnd</italic> gene cluster interact with each other, and with the nucleotides of the highly conserved central core or the flanking regions. The absolute requirement of the central core (GGCC), in which modification sites were located at the two central bases on complementary strands, indicates unambiguously that the modifying activity is concentrated on these four nucleotide residues (GGCC) both for preferential and random modification in wild-type 1326 and in the <italic>dnd</italic>B<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant HXY2. Conceivably, these four nucleotides must be in close and direct contact with one of the major modifying enzymes. The preferential recognition specificity, totally unaffected in 1326 but variably abolished or reduced in HXY2, after mutation of the four nucleotides flanking the right, and two separated nucleotides flanking the left of the central core (GGCC), strikingly implicates the necessity of DndB in determining the recognition specificity. This agreed well with the detection of the significant amino acid sequence similarity of DndB to a DNA gyrase, which suggests that the DndB protein could in someway affect DNA topology, and thus the efficiency and/or specificity of S-modification on certain sites flanked by the sequences with a potential to form secondary structures. This could also explain why the DndB protein is not required at &#x02018;simple&#x02019; recognition sites without flanking sequence complexity. We assume that the change from preferential modification sites, as detected in wild-type 1326, to a relatively random distribution of modification sites, as detected in its <italic>dnd</italic>B mutant HXY2, is mediated by the DndB protein encoded by <italic>dnd</italic>B. It is likely that random modification does not need DndB but a close association of DndB with the modifying enzymes could stabilize the contact between GGCC and the modifying complex.</p><p>It is not clear why a 5.4-kb circular plasmid molecule could only be modified once, although multiple modification sites are available. The presence of numerous modifiable sites on the chromosome suggests that modification frequency does not depend on the number of molecules, large or small, but more likely, by the length of the DNA flanking both sides of the modified site occupied by modifying enzymes. We do not know whether it is the binding of the modifying enzyme complex to a specific GGCC-containing site, or the result of modification, which prevents further binding of the modifying enzyme complex to a neighboring GGCC-containing site on either chromosome or plasmid, but it is hard to think that the result of modification could have contributed to this phenomenon. The fact that the Dnd phenotype could only be observed when a plasmid carrying the <italic>dnd</italic> gene cluster was present either in the integrated form or on a low copy number (&#x0003c;10) plasmid, but not at high copy number (Li,A.. unpublished data) implied that the expression of the <italic>dnd</italic> gene cluster in 1326 could be tightly controlled, and thus the dosage of the modifying enzyme complex could be limited in the cell. We propose that a protein complex formed at one specific site which involved nicking, winding and unwinding of the supercoiled double helix could exclude nearby site(s), and additionally, the number of sets of the Dnd protein complex is restricted to a cell-tolerated number by an unknown mechanism. To test the former hypothesis, it would be interesting to define the approximate length of the sequences flanking the consensus GGCC, within which modifiable sites were insensitive to modification, by analyzing plasmids of variable size. This work is now under consideration.</p><p>The proposed biochemical pathway leading to DNA modification by S involves five putative proteins encoded by a well-characterized <italic>dnd</italic> gene cluster. Of these, DndA was characterized as a PLP-containing homodimer that specifically catalyzes formation of L-alanine and elemental S using L-cysteine as substrate, DndC as an ATP pyrophosphatase catalyzing hydrolysis of ATP to pyrophosphate (PPi), and the function of DndC was found to be mediation of the formation of an [4Fe-4S] iron&#x02013;sulfur cluster protein, whose reconstitution was activated by DndA (25). Instead, the exact biochemical functions of DndD and DndE, have not been demonstrated. While DndD, a bioinformatically predicted SMC-like ATPase with a distinguishable myosin-tail consisting of a coiled-coil region and a flexible hinge, could function as an ATP-modulated DNA cross-linker and energy generator by ATP hydrolysis, DndE was expected to involve in determining the sulfur-existing status. From the present work, it seems reasonable to assume that DndC, forming a [4Fe&#x02013;4S] iron&#x02013;sulfur cluster protein, might provide a platform for the orchestrated assembly of the Dnd protein complex, although some member(s) could be associated or not at specific stages of their required activities. The merit of the present work is thus, in essence, to have provided information for additional experiments aimed at demonstrating the interaction(s) between different proteins or between variable combinations of protein(s) and specific target DNA, including those mediating secondary structure formation and/or binding tightly or loosely under different condition(s) using, e.g. immuno-precipitations and gel shift mobility assays. This work is now in active progress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are very grateful to Prof. Sir David Hopwood, FRS for his continuous support and encouragement throughout this study for many years, and critical and patient editing of the manuscript.

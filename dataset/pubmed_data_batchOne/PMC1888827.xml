The study of miRNA function in mice and potential therapeutic approaches largely depend on modified oligonucleotides. We recently demonstrated silencing miRNA function in mice using chemically modified and cholesterol-conjugated RNAs termed &#x02018;antagomirs&#x02019;. Here, we further characterize the properties and function of antagomirs in mice. We demonstrate that antagomirs harbor optimized phosphorothioate modifications, require &#x0003e;19-nt length for highest efficiency and can discriminate between single nucleotide mismatches of the targeted miRNA. Degradation of different chemically protected miRNA/antagomir duplexes in mouse livers and localization of antagomirs in a cytosolic compartment that is distinct from processing (P)-bodies indicates a degradation mechanism independent of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Finally, we show that antagomirs, although incapable of silencing miRNAs in the central nervous system (CNS) when injected systemically, efficiently target miRNAs when injected locally into the mouse cortex. Our data further validate the effectiveness of antagomirs <italic>in vivo</italic> and should facilitate future studies to silence miRNAs for functional analysis and in clinically relevant settings.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MiRNAs are an abundant class of non-coding RNA ranging from 20 to 23&#x02009;nt of length that are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. MiRNAs have been mainly associated with developmental processes in metazoa such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> or <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). However, evidence also suggests a role for miRNAs in a wide range of functions in mammals, including insulin secretion, heart, skeletal muscle and brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Furthermore, miRNAs have been implicated in diseases such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and hepatitis C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), which make them attractive new drug targets. In contrast to the widely used RNAi technology using small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, strategies to inhibit miRNAs have been less well investigated. Reverse-complement 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl sugar modified RNA is frequently being used to block miRNA function in cell-based systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The use of miRNA inhibitors in mice, however, remains challenging. Recently, two independent approaches to silence miRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> have been reported. Our group demonstrated silencing of miRNAs in mice based on RNA analogs termed &#x02018;antagomirs&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Antagomirs are RNA-like oligonucleotides that harbor various modifications for RNAse protection and pharmacologic properties such as enhanced tissue and cellular uptake. They differ from normal RNA by complete 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of sugar, phosphorothioate backbone and a cholesterol-moiety at 3&#x02032;-end. Antagomirs efficiently silence miRNAs in most tissues after three injections at 80&#x02009;mg/kg bodyweight (bw) on consecutive days. Esau <italic>et al</italic>. recently demonstrated a different strategy to silence miRNA(miR)-122 in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). They inhibited miR-122 following a four-week treatment protocol with two injections per week of 12.5&#x02013;75&#x02009;mg/kg bw of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) harboring a complete 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methoxyethyl and phosphorothioate modification.</p><p>Ultimately the efficient use of oligonucleotides to target miRNAs for functional studies and therapeutic use will be dependent on characterizations based on miRNA targets <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, more efficient strategies could be developed through a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms of miRNA silencing. In this study, we begin to address these questions using regulation of endogenous miR-122 targets and fluorophore-tagged antagomirs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Synthesis of antagomirs</title><p>The single-stranded RNAs and modified RNA analogs (antagomirs) were synthesized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and a schematic representation of the chemical modifications is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Quasar-570 (Q570) phosphoramidite from Biosearch Technologies was coupled to the 5&#x02032;-terminal under standard solid-phase phosphoramidite synthesis conditions to obtain fluorophore-tagged antagomir 122 and mm-antagomir-122. Extended 15-min coupling of quasar-570 phosphoramidite was carried out at a concentration of 0.1&#x02009;M in CH<sub>3</sub>CN in the presence of 5-(ethylthio)-1<italic>H</italic>-tetrazole activator followed by standard capping, oxidation and deprotection afforded labeled oligonucleotides. The Q570 conjugated sequences were HPLC purified on an in-house packed RPC-Source15 reverse-phase column. The buffers were 20&#x02009;mM NaOAc in 10% CH<sub>3</sub>CN (buffer A) and 20&#x02009;mM NaOAc in 70% CH<sub>3</sub>CN (buffer B). Fractions containing full-length oligonucleotides were pooled and desalted. Analytical HPLC, CGE and ES LC-MS established the integrity of the compounds. For duplex generation, equimolar amounts of miR-122 and antagomir were heated in 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;PBS at 95&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;min and slowly cooled to room temperature.

Two phosphorothioates are located at the 5&#x02032;-end and four at the 3&#x02032;-end. To test whether the number of phosphorothioates is critical for the ability of antagomir-122 to silence miR-122, we compared four different antagomir-122 molecules that only differ in the number of phosphorothioate modification (P=S). Injection of antagomir-122&#x02009;at 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20&#x02009;mg/kg bw with no P=S into mice did not influence miR-122 levels in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The addition of a single P=S did not alter miR-122 levels either as compared to the antagomir-122 with six P=S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Intriguingly, complete P=S modification of the antagomir-122 did not further increase the effect on miR-122 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). These results demonstrate that phosphorothioates are important for antagomir-122 function, however, complete replacement of P=O by P=S decreases its efficiency. The result can be explained by the enhanced stability provided by the terminal P=S-linked antagomir and the reduced thermodynamic stability of the fully modified P=S antagomir duplex with targeted miRNA.

Together, these results further elicit the requirement of optimum number of phosphorothioate modifications and minimum length of antagomirs for their biological function <italic>in vivo</italic>.

The effect of 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;40&#x02009;mg/kg on miR-122 levels is stable for at least 8 days (=5 days after the last injection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The expression of miR-122 targets correlated with the reduction of miR-122 levels in northern blots and showed highest upregulation at antagomir concentrations between 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;40 and 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;80&#x02009;mg/kg bw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). All targets analyzed showed stable upregulation for at least 5 days after the last injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Together, the results demonstrate that robust and lasting upregulation of miR-122 targets is achieved at antagomir concentrations between 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;40 and 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;80&#x02009;mg/kg bw as early as 24&#x02009;h after the last injection.

Four mismatches, two mismatches or a single mismatch at position 19 was sufficient to prevent downregulation of miR-122 and upregulation of three different miR-122 targets (AldoA, Tmed3 and Hfe2) as measured by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). However, single nucleotide mismatches at two different positions (nt1 or nt11) did not prevent downregulation of miR-122 levels or target regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). These data demonstrate that antagomirs can exhibit high sequence specificity. However, discrimination at the single nucleotide level is position-dependent and has to be tested for each microRNA sequence that is being targeted.

We synthesized duplexes of antagomir-122 and a synthetic miR-122 that harbored modifications to protect against different RNAse activities. MiR-122 was either protected at the outside (&#x02018;out&#x02019;) with a phosphorothioate modification to protect against exonucleases or at two consecutive internal positions (nt13 and nt14 of miR-122; &#x02018;in&#x02019;) using 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl sugar modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) to protect against endonuclease activity. Injection of both types of duplexes led to the appearance of degradation products of the synthetic miR-122 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). These degradation products did not appear when the duplexes were directly analyzed on the polyacrylamide gels or after they had been subjected to the RNA isolation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, &#x02018;spiked control&#x02019;). Furthermore, the spiked control data demonstrate that the synthetic miRNA was not lost during the isolation procedure. These data show that both types of stabilized miR-122 that were bound to the antagomir-122 had been degraded. Accordingly, both types of protected duplexes upregulated three different miR-122 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). We conclude that antagomir-mediated-silencing of miRNAs involves target degradation. However, this process does not depend on exonuclease activity and seems to differ from the RNAi pathway.

Q570-labeling did not impair antagomir-122 function, although silencing efficiency was slightly decreased (data not shown). First, we fractionated liver homogenates from mice that had been treated with Q570-mm-antagomir-122 by ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradients. Northern blot analysis of various fractions showed a single peak of tRNA in fraction 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). In contrast, miR-122 and mm-antagomir-122 localized both to two peaks, fraction 2/3 and fraction 7/8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). We next investigated whether co-localization of antagomirs and miRNAs involves the P-body compartment. To visualize P-bodies in mouse liver <italic>in vivo</italic> we used a GFP-expressing construct (GFP-GW182) that has previously been demonstrated to act as a marker for the P-body compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). We overexpressed GFP-GW182 in liver using high-pressure high-volume tail vein injections and analyzed GFP- and Q570-fluorescence with laser-scanning microscopy. Q570-labeled antagomirs were exclusively localized in the cytosol and distinct from P-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). There was no overlap between these two compartments. Together, we conclude that antagomirs and miRNA interact in a cytoplasmic compartment upstream of P-bodies.

PBS injections into the contra lateral side of the same animal served as controls. A single injection of &#x0223c;0.8&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of antagomir led to a robust decrease in miR-16 expression at 3 days after the injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).

A detailed understanding of this process is needed to investigate miRNA function in mice and exploit their therapeutic potential. Our study provides a unique platform since its major read-out is based on the dose-and time-dependent regulation of several endogenous and validated targets of miR-122.</p><p>Specificity of drug-like oligonucleotides is important to minimize off-target effects and to discriminate between related miRNAs that sometimes differ by only a single nucleotide. Previous studies have demonstrated that locked nucleic acid (LNA) are sensitive to single mismatch in <italic>in-situ</italic> staining protocols of zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Tissue-culture-based luciferase assays indicated that 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methoxyethyl oligonucleotides might have a similar specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In line with these data we show that the antagomir chemistry enables discrimination of a single nucleotide. Intriguingly, this effect depends on the position of the mismatch within the antagomir sequence. Nucleotide exchanges at the very 5&#x02032;-end of the antagomir or in the center did not prevent downregulation of miR-122 levels in northern blots and upregulation of miR-122 targets. This observation is in agreement with the work published by Davis <italic>et al</italic>., who reported a similar result in luciferase-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Asymmetry of a single nucleotide mismatch may therefore be more detrimental for targeting miRNAs than symmetric changes. These data are important for the design of antagomirs that target specific members of miRNA families or when off-target effects have to be considered.</p><p>The mechanism of oligonucleotide-mediated miRNA silencing is still unknown. Previous data from our group and others suggested that this process involves degradation of the miRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Northern blots of tissue samples treated with antagomirs fail to detect fragments of the targeted miRNA. This could be explained by cellular RNase activity that readily degrades them. We have previously demonstrated that increasing the cellular amount of endogenous miRNA by introducing duplexes of miRNA/antagomir leads to detectable degradation products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In this study, we used this approach to ask whether antagomir-mediated silencing of miRNA involves a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-dependent cleavage mechanism. In the RNAi pathway, the siRNA duplex of passenger strand and guide strand is integrated into the RISC complex and the argonaute-2 (Ago2) protein subsequently cleaves the passenger strand across from the guide strand's phosphate bond between position 10 and 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This cleavage was inhibited by a single 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of the passenger strand corresponding to nucleotide 11 of the guide strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Hypothetically, antagomirs could cleave miRNAs within RISC with the antagomir acting as the guide strand. To test this, we injected miRNA/antagomir-duplexes into mice that harbored a 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl endonuclease protection of the microRNA corresponding to nucleotide 10 and 11 of the antagomir. However, endonuclease protection between nucleotides 10 and 11 did not prevent the degradation of the miRNA as demonstrated by abundant miRNA fragments in northern analysis, nor did it prevent the upregulation of miR-122 targets. Thus Ago2-mediated cleavage is unlikely to mediate this process. Similar results were obtained when the miRNA was protected at the outside positions using phosphorothioates, indicating that the miRNA targeting does not dependent on exonuclease activity either. However, the fact that miRNA/antagomir-duplexes regulate miRNA targets suggests antagomir recycling. The appearance of miRNA fragments of decreased length suggests that degradation is involved in this recycling process. Further elucidation of the mechanism of degradation will be important for optimizing miRNA silencing.</p><p>To address the subcellular compartment where interaction of miRNA and antagomir occurs we engineered flurophore-labeled antagomirs. Flurophore labeling of siRNA has previously been used to evaluate cellular uptake of siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Q570-labeled antagomirs were cleared from the plasma at a <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of &#x0223c;30&#x02009;min (data not shown), which is considerably faster than the plasma-clearance of cholesterol-conjugated siRNA of &#x0223c;90&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). A striking overlap of the subcellular localization profiles of antagomirs and miRNAs by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of liver homogenates indicates that they might share subcellular compartments. Antagomir localization within hepatocytes was strictly limited to the cytosol. This could explain why antagomirs did not influence steady-state levels of the nuclear precursors of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). We asked whether antagomirs could localize to P-bodies, since this compartment has been linked to the miRNA pathway. P-bodies are enriched in Ago 2 as well as mRNA that is targeted by miRNAs. It is, however, still unknown to which degree endogenous miRNAs localize to P-bodies. In any case, we did not observe any co-localization of antagomirs and P-bodies and conclude that the interaction of antagomirs and miRNAs occurs upstream of this compartment.</p><p>In this study, we also extended our previous analysis of the influence of different chemical modifications on antagomirs. Phosphorothioate modifications provide protection against RNase activity and their lipophilicity contributes to enhanced tissue uptake. On the other hand, phosphorothioates decrease the melting temperature of RNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and have been shown to be general inhibitors of cellular RNAse activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Indeed our results indicate a critical balance of the number of phosphorothioates within the antagomir chemistry. While a significant number of phosphorothioates increases efficiency, complete phosphorothioate modification decreased efficiency. Our data also demonstrate that antagomirs require &#x0003e;19-nt length for optimal function.</p><p>Lastly, we demonstrate that antagomirs can efficiently decrease miR-16 levels in mouse brain when injected locally. Systemic infusions of antagomir-16 do not change brain levels of miR-16, most likely because of an inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Local injections of small amounts of antagomir-16 efficiently reduced expression of this miR-16 in the cortex. This inhibition was specific since the expression of other miRNAs was not affected and no alteration in miR-16 levels were measured in the contralateral hemisphere that was injected with PBS. These results suggest that miRNA-inhibitors could facilitate the elucidation of miRNA function in the CNS.</p><p>Different chemical modifications have been described to block miRNA function <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) or <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, detailed characterizations of these inhibitors are either lacking or based on heterologous miRNA target reporter assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In this study, we used the expression levels of endogenous miR-122 targets as a read-out. We show that antagomirs can be used in a time- and dose-dependent fashion to study miRNA targets. Furthermore, we characterized antagomirs with regard to specificity, functional minimal-length requirements and effectiveness in the CNS following direct application. Our data support the conclusion that antagomirs will be powerful tools for further studies on miRNA function in mice and possibly non-rodent models and enhance the validation of miRNA inhibitors as potential therapeutics.</p></sec>

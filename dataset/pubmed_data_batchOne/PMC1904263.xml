Temperate phages can grow lytically or form lysogeny after infection. A transcriptional switch that contains two con-vergent promoters, Pe and Pc, and two repressors regulate what life mode to enter. The immunity repressor C is the first gene of the lysogenic operon, and it blocks the early Pe promoter. In this work, some characteristics of the C proteins of P2 and W<bold>&#x003a6;</bold> are compared. An <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic analysis shows that W<bold>&#x003a6;</bold> C, like P2&#x02009;C, has a strong dimerization activity in the absence of its DNA target. Both C proteins recognize two directly repeated sequences, termed half-sites and a strong bending is induced in the respective DNA target upon binding. P2&#x02009;C is unable to bind to one half-site as opposed to W<bold>&#x003a6;</bold>, but both half-sites are required for repression of W<bold>&#x003a6;</bold> Pe. A reduction from three to two helical turns between the centers of the half-sites in W<bold>&#x003a6;</bold> has no significant effect on the capacity to repress Pe. However, the protein&#x02013;DNA complexes formed differ, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift experiments. A difference in spontaneous phage production is observed in isogenic lysogens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The original classification of the temperate P2-like phages was based on common characteristics such as serological relatedness, host-range and non-inducibility by UV light and serologically unrelatedness to phage lambda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Since then, several phages or prophages have been found in various &#x003b3;-proteobacteria that based on similarities of genome organization and gene content have been classified as P2-like, for a recent review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). P2-like phages are common in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and &#x0223c;30% of the strains in the <italic>E. coli</italic> reference collection ECOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) contain P2-like prophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). An analysis of the structural genes of 18 isolated P2-like coliphages has shown that they have at least 96% identity to those of P2, and therefore might be considered as different isolates of P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, a sequence analysis of the immunity repressors of 19 P2-like prophages in the ECOR collection and 13 P2-like coliphages identified seven different immunity classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Temperate phages have after infection a choice either to grow lytically or form lysogens. A developmental, or transcriptional switch determines which pathway the phage will enter. The transcriptional switches of the P2-like phages have some common characteristics, i.e. two converging promoters and two repressors that recognize different operators. Thus, they differ from the well characterized transcriptional switch of phage &#x003bb; where the repressors recognize the same three operators containing a 17-nt long inverted repeat, although with different affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The immunity repressors are termed C or CI, and the lytic repressors are termed Cox or Apl. The immunity repressors of the P2-like phages can be divided into two types depending on size, sequence similarity and control; the 186-like CI proteins and the P2-like C proteins. The CI protein of phage 186 is 196 aa long and consists of two domains. The N-terminal domain contains the DNA-binding motif and the C-terminal domain contains the oligomerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The CI repressor recognizes three inverted repeats of two types in the early promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In addition, there are distantly located operators and cooperative binding between the operators in the early promoter region and the distal operators has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The structure of the C-terminal domain of 186 CI has been determined, and it has been shown to form a heptamer of dimers that are believed to wrap the operator DNA around the outside of the large 14-mer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Like phage &#x003bb; the <italic>cI</italic> gene of phage 186 has two promoters, one for establishment of lysogeny and another for its maintenance. The promoter for establishment of lysogeny is activated by the phage-encoded CII protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>The P2-like C proteins are small homologous proteins &#x0223c;100 aa long. They recognize directly repeated sequences in the early promoter region and are expressed from one promoter only, thus no CII like protein has been identified. The C proteins of phage P2 and W&#x003d5; represent two different immunity groups, where the operators have been located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The identity between the C repressors is 43% at the amino acid level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). The C proteins recognize a pair of direct repeats, but the repeats differ in sequence, length, spacing and location relative to the early promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b).

In P2, the center-to-center distance between the half-sites is two helical turns (22&#x02009;nt), and in W&#x003a6; approximately three helical turns (34&#x02009;nt). The transcriptional start sites of the promoters of the early operon (Pe) and the lysogenic operon (Pc) of W&#x003a6; have been determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), while those of P2 are not known.

A primer located 125&#x02009;nt downstream of the presumed &#x02212;10 region was used to detect the start site of the Pe transcript.

In the case of P2, this cannot be done without affecting the Pe promoter and the transcriptional start site. In W&#x003a6; it is possible to change the distance between the transcriptional start site and O2 without affecting the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b). Therefore, the wild-type W&#x003a6; operator/promoter region and two constructs removing 6 or 10&#x02009;nt, respectively, upstream of the O2 half&#x02013;site were inserted in front of a promoter-less <italic>cat</italic> gene (plasmids pEE938&#x02013;pEE940). The capacity of the W&#x003a6; C protein to repress the wild type and the modified operators were analyzed by determination of the CAT activity after transformation into a W&#x003a6; lysogenic strain. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, there is no significant difference in the level of CAT expression using the wild type and the modified operators, and the level is only 1&#x02013;9% of the activity obtained with the respective fully derepressed Pe promoter, i.e. in the absence of C. Thus, the spacing between the two operator sites of W&#x003a6; can be reduced by a half or a full helical turn without affecting the capacity of C to repress the promoter.

Thus, we were interested in analyzing the complexes formed between W&#x003a6; C and its operator when the center-to-center distance between the half-sites was changed to 2 and 2.5 helical turns, respectively. Using PCR fragments from the same constructs as in the reporter system above in an EMSA with the W&#x003a6; C protein (plasmids pEE938&#x02013;940), only two shifted bands are evident with wt DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This can either be explained by the fact that this construct lacks the phage sequences flanking the operator, or by the locations of the operator half-sites relative to the end of the fragment, since W&#x003a6; C bends its DNA target, see below. Furthermore, the slow migrating band is not obtained when the distance between the half-sites of the operator was changed by a half or one helical turn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, it seems as if the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions used in the EMSA, using linear DNA as a target, will not allow binding of W&#x003a6; C to both half-sites simultaneously if the distance between the half-sites is decreased.

With vector sequences flanking the promoter/operator only two fragments are consistently generated, and surprisingly even though the fragments have about the same length in both constructs they migrate differently. It also seems as if the protein concentration required to detect binding is slightly higher in the absence of flanking phage DNA. However, the dissociation constants calculated from titrations, using a constant amount of DNA and an increasing amount of C, followed by a quantification of shifted DNA in the EMSA and a linear regression analysis of the generated curves, were the same.

Since the spacing between the half-sites of the operators differ in P2 and W&#x003a6;, binding of the two C repressors might affect DNA topology differently. To investigate the bending capacity of the two C repressors, the respective early promoter/operator region was cloned into the pBend2 vector, a pBR322 derivative containing a directly repeated polylinker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The pertinent region was amplified from the vector by PCR, and the amplified fragment was cleaved with restriction enzymes generating fragments of the same size, but the location of the operator relative to the ends of the fragments varied. After incubation with the respective C protein, the relative mobility of each fragment was analyzed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Depending on the location of the operator, the fragments would migrate differently of the C repressors bend DNA upon binding.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>a shows the results using W&#x003a6; C and its operator region.

This shows that W&#x003a6; C bends the DNA substrate. The bending center seems to be located between the O1 and O2 half-sites, which was analyzed by plotting the relative mobility values against the location of the operator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>a).

P2&#x02009;C has been shown to form dimers but the capacity to form higher oligomers in the absence of DNA is very weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Since the oligomeric state of W&#x003a6; C had not been studied, the dimerization and oligomerization efficiency of W&#x003a6; C was analyzed and compared to that of P2&#x02009;C using an <italic>in vivo</italic> plasmid system based on the interaction between &#x003bb; CI repressor and its right operator O<sub>R</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The N-terminal domain of &#x003bb; CI contains the DNA-binding motif, but efficient operator binding requires dimerization. The dimerization domain is located in the C-terminal domain of &#x003bb; CI. By fusing a protein able to dimerize to the N-terminal domain of CI, high-affinity binding to the &#x003bb; operator can be restored. The W&#x003a6; <italic>C</italic> gene was fused to the N-terminal domain of &#x003bb; <italic>cI</italic>, which was under the control of the <italic>lacUV5</italic> promoter generating plasmid pEE923. The construct was transformed into the reporter strain JH372. To quantify dimerization, a <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene, controlled by the right &#x003bb; operator/promoter (O<sub>R</sub>P<sub>R</sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic>), has been inserted into the chromosome of the reporter strain. The capacity of the CI-W&#x003a6;C fusion protein to bind to &#x003bb; O<sub>R</sub> and repress P<sub>R</sub> was quantified by measuring the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity is as low for the &#x003bb; CI-W&#x003a6;C fusion protein as for the &#x003bb; CI-P2C fusion protein and at least 8-fold lower that the negative controls pZ150 (no repressor) and pKH101 (contains only the N-terminus of &#x003bb; CI). It should be noted that the repression by both the P2 and the W&#x003a6; fusion proteins is more efficient compared to the full-length &#x003bb; CI proteins used as a positive control, indicating that the C proteins dimerize more efficiently than &#x003bb; CI.

This promoter is repressed only if the &#x003bb; CI repressor dimer binding to the strong upstream operator is able to recruit and stabilize another dimer at the weak operator. Plasmid pEE923 expressing the &#x003bb; CI-W&#x003a6; C fusion protein was transformed into strain AG1688(&#x003bb;112O<sub>S</sub>P<sub>S</sub>), where <italic>lacZ</italic> expression is controlled by the synthetic promoter&#x02013;operator region, and into strain AG1688(&#x003bb;XZ970), where the promoter of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene is under the control of only the weak &#x003bb; operator to measure the background repression caused by binding of the dimer to the weak proximal operator. The ratio between the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities between the two strains will reflect the capacity of cooperative binding to the strong and the weak operator. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>, the ratio for the &#x003bb; CI- W&#x003a6; C fusion of is 0.9, and that of P2 is 1.5, while the positive control pJH622 (expressing a modified CI-GCN4 fusion protein that forms tetramers) gives a ratio of 7.0, and the negative controls pJH370 (expressing the CI-GCN4 fusion protein that only forms dimers) and pZ150 (expressing no fusion protein) gives ratios around 1. This implies that under these conditions the W&#x003a6; C protein, like the P2&#x02009;C protein, is unable to bind cooperatively or form higher oligomeric structures in the absence of its DNA target.

To compare the level of free phages released by P2 and W&#x003a6; lysogens, bacteria lysogenic for the respective phage were grown and the titers of free phages and bacteria were determined in overnight cultures.

The repressors might, however, form higher oligomeric structures upon binding to DNA. Both C repressors induce bending of its respective DNA target upon binding, and it seems as if P2&#x02009;C induces a slightly stronger bend in the DNA. However, this difference may be a consequence of the locations of the operator half-sites, or within the fluctuations caused by the limitations of the determination of the bending angle in the circular permutation analysis.</p><p>The distance between the operator half-sites in P2 and W&#x003a6; differs, but as shown here, a reduction of the distance between the half-sites in W&#x003a6; from 3 to 2.5 or 2 turns has no effect of the capacity of W&#x003a6; C to repress the early promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the complexes formed in our electrophoretic mobility shift analysis differ, only the fast migrating complex is formed when the distance is decreased. Possibly this fast migrating band correspond to binding to only one half-site, and that the substrate needs to be supercoiled for binding to both half-sites when the distance between the half-sites is reduced. This possibility is supported by the fact that in constructs containing only one half-site (O1), where O2 has been mutated or in the hybrid promoter/operator constructs, only one retarded protein&#x02013;DNA complex is formed and the <italic>in vivo</italic> assays show that C cannot regulate the constructs that lacks the other half-site.</p><p>The electrophoretic mobility shift analysis performed in this work indicate that P2 and W&#x003a6; C have different requirements for DNA binding and that the protein&#x02013;DNA complexes formed differ. P2&#x02009;C is unable to bind to one half-site as opposed to W&#x003a6; C. Furthermore, W&#x003a6; C gives three retarded fragments to its wild-type operator/promoter region, indicating an ability to bind to the half-sites independently. However, our analysis shows that the phage sequences upstream of the &#x02212;35 region and downstream of O2 affects both the promoter activity and the repressor&#x02013;DNA complexes formed. Replacing the phage flanking sequences with vector DNA leads to an almost 100-fold increase in the <italic>in vivo</italic> expression system using the <italic>cat</italic> reporter gene in the absence of the repressor, indicating an interference of some phage sequences or an enhancement of the vector DNA. This is an interesting observation that has not been studied further in this work, since the capacity of the W&#x003a6; C to repress both constructs is as efficient, indicating that the flanking sequences do not affect the capacity of C to bind and repress its operator <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the repressor&#x02013;DNA complexes formed in the electrophoretic mobility shift analysis differ. Instead of the three fragments generated by the wild-type operator/promoter region, only two fragments are generated when the phage flanking regions are replaced by vector sequences. A possible explanation could be that secondary binding sites are present in the flanking sequences. However, since both the construct containing multiple mutations in O1 with flanking phage DNA and the hybrid operator/promoter constructs that contain only O1 or O2 generate only one shifted band in our EMSAs secondary binding sites seems very unlikely. Our results clearly points to the difficulties in interpretation of the biological significance of complexes formed <italic>in vitro</italic> using EMSA, and the importance of complementary <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis.</p><p>Localization of the start sites of the P2 Pe and Pc transcripts confirm that the transcripts overlap by &#x0223c;35&#x02009;nt. A foot-print analysis of P2&#x02009;C shows that the C protein covers not only the O1 and O2 region, but also &#x0223c;12&#x02009;nt downstream of O2, i.e. to &#x0223c;+16 of Pe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The protected region is interrupted by at least three enhanced cleavage sites, giving four short protected sites spaced by enhanced cleavage two of them correspond to O1 and O2, one to the spacer region between the half-sites, and the fourth is located downstream of O2. One way of interpreting this is that four C protein molecules bind to this region. Since RNA polymerase binding to Pc should cover 75&#x02013;80&#x02009;nt, (from &#x02212;60 to +20), i.e. P2&#x02009;C and the polymerase should be very close which can explain the autoregulation of C expression on Pc expression. In W&#x003a6;, however, the Pe and Pc promoters are further apart from each other and the transcripts overlap by 82&#x02009;nt, and O2 is located 60&#x02009;nt from the start site of Pc. Since it is not known if W&#x003a6; C regulates its own Pc promoter, further studies are required before any conclusions can be drawn about the consequences of the difference in distance between the Pe and Pc promoters of the two phages. The observed difference in spontaneous phage production from strains carrying either P2 or W&#x003a6; prophage might reflect differences in the components of the transcriptional switch, such as relative strengths of the Pe and Pc promoters and the kinetics of the interactions between the C and the Cox repressors and their respective operator. The kinetics of the interactions between the C proteins to their respective operator has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), but not the interactions of the Cox proteins with their operators. Other phage or cellular factors could also affect the burst size.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Jim Hu for providing the strains and plasmids for the dimerization/oligomerization assays, and B.H.Lindqvist for helpful discussions.

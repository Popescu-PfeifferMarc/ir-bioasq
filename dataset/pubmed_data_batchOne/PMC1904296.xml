Steroid receptors bind as dimers to palindromic response elements differing in the two central base pairs of repeated motifs. Predictions based on one amino acid&#x02014;one base-pair relationships may not apply to estrogen receptors (ERs), which recognize the two central base pairs of estrogen response elements (EREs) via two charged amino acids, each contacting two bases on opposite DNA strands. Mutagenesis of these residues, E203 and K210 in ER&#x003b1;, indicated that both contribute to ERE binding. Removal of the electric charge and steric constraints associated with K210 was required for full loss of parental DNA-binding specificity and recognition of novel sequences by E203 mutants. Although some of the new binding profiles did not match predictions, the double mutation E203R-K210A generated as predicted a mutant ER that was transcriptionally active on palindromes of PuG<underline>C</underline>TCA motifs, but not on consensus EREs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of designing C4 zinc finger mutants with novel DNA-binding specificity, but also uncovers limitations of this approach.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nuclear receptors form a superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors that is characterized by two conserved domains, the DNA-binding domain (DBD) composed of two C4 type zinc fingers, and the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which also contains a dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Nuclear receptors can bind DNA as homo- and/or heterodimers, and recognize response elements arranged as direct repeats, palindromes or inverted palindromes of conserved motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Each motif is bound by the DBD of a single monomer, the two zinc fingers of the DBD combining into a single structural fold with a DNA recognition helix and variable dimerization interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Consensus estrogen response elements (EREs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), which are palindromes of PuGGTCA motifs with a three base-pair spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>), are bound by estrogen receptors (ERs) with highest affinity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Perfect or imperfect EREs present at promoter-proximal locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>) or, as revealed by genome-wide screens, at large distances from the transcriptional start site of estrogen-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), are bound by ER&#x003b1; <italic>in vivo</italic> and mediate regulation of estrogen target genes. Other steroid receptors, including the androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), also bind palindromes with a three base-pair spacer, but the repeated motifs are PuGNACA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Non-steroid receptors also recognize PuGGTCA or related motifs, but these motifs are arranged as direct repeats or everted repeats with variable spacing. The affinity and selectivity of nuclear receptors for single PuGGTCA motifs is generally low, but can be increased by receptor-specific recognition of additional 5&#x02032; flanking bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Thus, nuclear receptors have achieved selectivity in DNA recognition while interacting with only two main types of motifs. The fact that few variations have been observed in the base-contacting amino acids of the 48 human nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) suggests that this type of protein&#x02013;DNA recognition has been conserved throughout evolution, possibly because it affords the most favorable combination of affinity and selectivity. Interestingly, however, nuclear receptor homologs identified in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> offer a considerably wider variety of amino acid composition in the DNA recognition helix. Numerous mutations have also been described in the DBD of some nuclear receptors such as VDR and AR, but few changes in DNA-binding patterns have been reported for these mutant receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).

Exchanging three amino acids in the ER DBD for the corresponding ones in the GR DBD resulted in a receptor mutant capable of transactivating glucocorticoid target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The converse experiment also demonstrated that amino acids at the same three positions (P box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, underlined residues) in the GR were crucial for discriminating between glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) and EREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In addition, a loop in the second zinc finger was found to be responsible for specific recognition of two motifs arranged as palindromes with 3&#x02009;bp spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>). Crystallographic analyses of complexes between the ER or GR DBDs and their response elements have uncovered the amino acid&#x02013;base-pair interactions established by these two receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Two residues of the P box, V at the third position in the GR and E at the first position in the ER (E203), contact the central discriminating bases in the ERE and GRE motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). In addition, an invariant K residue located further C-terminal in the DNA recognition helix (K210 in ER&#x003b1;) binds the two central bases on the opposite strand with respect to bases contacted by E203 in the ER&#x003b1;&#x02013;ERE complex, but does not participate in contacts in the GR&#x02013;GRE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Other bases common to the ERE and GRE are contacted by amino acids conserved in ER and GR (K206 and R211 in ER&#x003b1;). In addition, these interactions are buttressed by a complex network of amino acid&#x02013;amino acid interactions and amino acid&#x02013;phosphate interactions.</p><p>The specificity of response motif recognition by steroid receptors is thus determined by a small number of specific interactions established by 3&#x02013;4 amino acids. As a consequence, it may be expected that changing the identity of interacting amino acids in the DNA recognition helix would alter the selectivity of receptor&#x02013;DNA interaction as can be achieved with artificial C2H2 zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B28">25&#x02013;28</xref>). A simple model for amino acid&#x02013;base interactions within the structural framework of the steroid receptor DBD has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). This model relies on chemical rules for possible pairing of amino acid side chains and DNA bases through hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions, and also incorporates stereochemical contraints specific to steroid receptors, based on the position of the DNA recognition helix with respect to the major groove of the DNA. Small, medium or large chains may thus be prefered depending on the position of the interacting amino acids in the DNA recognition helix with respect to the bases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D for possible interactions involving amino acid at position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Study of a spontaneous mutation in the first amino acid of the P box of the AR has revealed changes in DNA-binding specificity compatible with the predictions of this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Replacement of G at the first P box position in the AR DBD by R resulted in a mutant that could only bind a subset of the PuGNACA motifs normally bound by this receptor, and this according to the chemical preferences of the R residue with respect to the base at the third position of the motif. However, it remains unclear whether novel types of DNA specificities can be achieved through rational design of nuclear receptor mutants, especially in the case of the ERs, which appear to have more complex determinants of motif recognition than other steroid receptors. The purpose of this study was to examine whether mutating ER&#x003b1; residues that interact with the two central base pairs of EREs either separately or in pairs could generate artificial nuclear receptor DBDs with novel DNA-binding specificities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The bacterial expression vector pET3.1-HE81 containing the ER&#x003b1; DBD has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

Although natural response elements are often imperfect palindromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), base-pair replacements usually result in a loss of affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). To verify that binding patterns are mainly derived from the DBDs of ERs, we have compared the effect of symmetric substitutions at each position of the consensus ERE on binding by full-length ERs transiently expressed in HeLa cells (ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B, respectively) or by the ER&#x003b1; or ER&#x003b2; DBD (ER&#x003b1; DBD and ER&#x003b2;DBD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and D, respectively). The wild-type ERE was bound by either the full-length ER&#x003b1; receptor or the corresponding DBD with the highest affinity (note the higher degree of free probe depletion with wt ERE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and C, lanes 19). Consistent with our previous observations that the DBDs of steroid receptors are sufficient to discriminate between EREs and GREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), ER DBDs selectively bound the array of probes in a pattern similar to that of the full-length receptors, although all probes were less efficiently bound with isolated DBDs. This is consistent with a loss of affinity, but not specificity, resulting from the absence of the strong dimerization interface in the LBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In addition, all replacements introduced in both arms of the ERE reduced binding to the same extent for ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; (compare panels A and B, and C and D), which share a high degree of conservation in their DBDs [90% in region C as defined in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>)].

Nucleotides G (&#x02212;5) and G (+2) interact with residues at position 5 (K206) and 10 (R211) of the DNA recognition helix, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). In addition, K210 (position 9 in the DNA recognition helix) interacts with both G (&#x02212;4) and T (&#x02212;3) through direct and water-mediated contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Thus, basic residues are involved in recognition of all positions in the ERE except &#x02212;/+6 and &#x02212;/+1, which are not directly contacted in the crystal structure, although both display a preference for purines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> A&#x02013;D, lanes 1&#x02013;3 and 16&#x02013;18). These direct interactions involving basic amino acids conform to general chemical rules, with G and T, which present only negatively charged groups in the major groove, being preferred over A, which presents both a positively and a negatively charged group, and C, which contains only a positively charged group, leading to unfavorable electrostatic interactions. Accordingly, replacement of G by C in a single motif at position &#x02212;4 or &#x02212;5 was sufficient to abolish binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lanes 5 and 8). Of note however, the order of the preferred bases is not identical for each contacting basic amino acid. Most noticeably, replacement in a single motif of G at position +2 by T was sufficient to abolish binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lanes 13). Molecular modeling suggests that lack of binding to T at position +2 results from steric hindrance due to the methyl group of T + 2, which prevents productive interaction between the amines of R211 and O4 of T + 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B).

Because E203 interacts with bases at positions +3 and +4, i.e. on the other DNA strand, in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), we compared the roles of both K210 and E203 in modulating patterns of base recognition. While E203 has an opposite and complementary type of chemical selectivity for bases (C &#x0003e; A &#x0003e; T &#x0003e; G) compared to K210, the complex mode of recognition of the two central base pairs by two amino acids may be expected to result in increased steric constraints. At position &#x02212;4, replacement in a single motif by T drastically reduced binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 9) and replacement in both motifs of the ERE completely eliminated complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;D, lanes 9) and transactivation [data not shown, see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>)]. This contrasts with the capacity of other nuclear receptors such as RAR, RXR and VDR to bind to PuGTTCA motifs [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>); see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) for a review]. Energy minimization indicates that movement of K210 to avoid the methyl group of T-4 prevents interaction with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). In addition, E203 is not capable of interacting with the amino group of A at position +4 (not shown). At position &#x02212;3, G was less favorable than T (compare lanes 12 and 19 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;D), contrary to what is observed at the other positions recognized by basic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Modeling indicates that C + 3 would create packing problems with E203, preventing interaction of this amino acid with C + 4, and K210 is too distant to interact with G&#x02212;3 (not shown). Thus, our experimental and modeling data suggest that both E203 and K210 contribute to the selectivity of response element recognition with respect to the two central bases of the ERE.</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of E203 and K210 in the specificity and affinity of ER interaction with palindromic response elements</title><p>To better analyze the respective roles of E203 and K210 in determining the specificity and affinity of ER interaction with response elements, we further characterized the ER-binding specificity with respect to the two central base pairs of the palindrome motifs using a panel of 16 probes representing all combinations of these central bases introduced in both arms of the palindrome. Full-length ERs and isolated DBDs bound with high affinity only to the GT (response elements are designated by bases found on the minus strand at position &#x02212;4/&#x02212;3) combination found in the wt ERE and, with lower affinity, to the GG element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D).

Crystallographic analysis of the GR DBD indicates that contacts are established only with the base at position +3 through a V residue (position 6 in the DNA-binding helix). E203 is replaced by a G residue in GR and AR, and the K residue corresponding to K210 in ER&#x003b1; does not contribute to GRE recognition. The higher selectivity of ER interaction with response elements could therefore result either from the fact that E203 interacts with both adjacent +4/+3 bases, and/or from the contribution of K210 in recognizing the &#x02212;4/&#x02212;3 bases on the opposite strand of DNA.</p><p>To investigate the respective roles of these two amino acids to the affinity and/or selectivity of binding, we replaced either E203 or K210 by A residues in ER&#x003b1; and examined complex formation with the panel of 16 probes corresponding to all possible variants at the two central positions of the repeated motifs. Both mutants still bound with highest efficiency to the consensus ERE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 12), although the intensity of the retarded band was &#x0223c;5-to 10-fold lower than with the wt ER&#x003b1; (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 12 and 17; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). However, the K210A mutation was active in transactivation assays using a reporter gene containing the consensus ERE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). Intriguingly, peak transcriptional activity was &#x0223c;60% higher for K210A than for the wt receptor, suggesting that K210 plays a negative role in transcriptional activation.

Binding of E203A to the AT probe suggests that the main role in restricting binding to this element in the wt receptor is played by E203 rather than K210. The absence of high affinity complexes observed with the K210A mutant suggests that the role of K210 in the selectivity of response element recognition is redundant with the role played by E203.</p></sec><sec><title>The effects of mutations of E203 on selective DNA binding are not predictable from simple chemical and steric compatibility rules</title><p>A simple DNA recognition model for steroid receptors has been proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), based on both the general rules of chemical compatibility between amino acids and base pairs, and stereochemical constraints due to the position of the DNA-binding helix across the major groove as derived from the crystal structures of the ER and GR DBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D for predicted interactions at amino acid position 2). Note that this model is based on a one amino acid&#x02013;one base interaction relationship, and in particular does not take into account recognition of the two central bases by both K210 and E203 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, dotted lines), considering only the role of E203 with C + 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, bold line). Our finding that E203 and K210 cooperate for selective binding to GT palindromes incited us to test the predictions of this model for replacement of E203 by other amino acids. Replacement of E by N is predicted to switch recognition from C at position +4 to A (TN elements), and replacement by H or R should lead to specific recognition of a G at this position (CN elements, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). These mutations were introduced in ER&#x003b1; full length and in the isolated DBD. Similar expression levels were obtained for all full-length mutants and the wild-type receptor as determined by western analysis (data not shown). Whole cell extracts containing the mutant receptors E203N and E203H formed complexes mainly with the wt ERE (GT probe, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B, lanes 13 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D and E, lanes 12). While binding to the wt ERE was not abolished, the patterns of probe recognition were altered with both mutants, which bound to the AT element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B, lanes 5 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D and E, lanes 4). These interactions are transcriptionally productive, as demonstrated by transient cotransfection of CAT reporter vectors containing the corresponding response elements cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter with expression vectors for the different mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B, ERE-tk-CAT and AT-tk-CAT reporter vector). Titration curves were performed using varying concentrations of transfected plamids, and protein levels were measured by western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Surprisingly, saturation was reached at identical protein concentrations for all receptors on either response element, indicating that the difference in efficiency of complex formation <italic>in vitro</italic> is not observable in our reporter assay (data not shown). This is possibly due to cooperative effects with other transcription factors bound to the promoter, or to chromatin organization. Peak transactivation levels were similar for the wt and mutant receptors on the consensus ERE, reflecting intact transcription activation properties for the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). On the other hand, mutant E203H, but not E203N, had &#x0223c;6-fold lower peak levels of transactivation on the AT element than on the consensus ERE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B; peak levels on the two response elements were obtained at the same protein concentration). The differential levels of maximal transcriptional activation by the E203H mutant on the two response elements may be related to the previously reported allosteric effect of the DNA sequence on ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activation properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).

Accordingly, the TT and CT elements did not confer estrogen responsiveness to the tk promoter in the presence of these mutants (data not shown). Note that no specific complexes were observed with the E203R mutant on any of the PuGNNCA probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 6</xref>C and F). Lack of binding to the consensus ERE and lack of transactivation on an ERE-tk-CAT reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C) suggest that R at this position has a destabilizing effect that is stronger than the absence of side chain (A mutation, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Replacement of E203 by R in the structure of the ER&#x02013;ERE complex reveals that the R side chain is too bulky to fit in the major groove of DNA, and that the amino groups exert repulsive effects with the positively charged groups of C + 4 and C + 5 and steric conflict with C + 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C and data not shown). In addition, neither binding to CN elements nor transactivation from reporter vectors containing the CT palindrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C, CT-tk-CAT reporter vector) was obtained, indicating again that the predicted switch in specificity has not occured. These results indicate that a model based on a one amino acid&#x02014;one base-pair relationship is not an accurate description of the interaction between the ER and its target response element, and suggest that K210 plays a role in modulating the DNA-binding specificity of receptors carrying mutations at position 203.</p></sec><sec><title>K210 restricts changes in DNA-binding specificity of mutants at position 203</title><p>Contrary to the total absence of binding observed with the E203R mutant of ER&#x003b1;, mutation of the corresponding amino acid in the AR (G577) to R led to a different pattern of response element binding than that of the wt receptor. While wt AR bound all four PuGNACA elements, the G577R mutant bound PuGGACA elements very weakly, but interacted with the three other PuGNACA elements, with a preference for the element containing a G at position +4 (PuG<underline>C</underline>ACA). In the context of the GR DBD, and presumably also the AR DBD, the K residue corresponding to K210 (position 9 in the DNA recognition helix) does not bind DNA, but is involved in an interaction with E at position 13 in the DNA recognition helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, we investigated whether mutation K210A may facilitate association of the E203 mutants to novel binding sites and/or reduce binding to the consensus ERE. The resulting E203N/K210A and E203H/K210A double mutants had a much reduced binding to this probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), confirming the role of K210 in binding to the consensus element in the absence of a residue at position 203 recognizing C + 4.

On the other hand, the double mutant E203R-K210A gained binding to the CT element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), as could be predicted from chemical compatibility between R at position 203 and G + 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D).

Thus, the specificity of base recognition expected from replacing the E203 residue by R was revealed in the presence of the K210A mutation, although an additional unpredicted complex was also formed with comparable efficiency. As the level of complex formation on the CT element was much lower than that of the wt receptor on the consensus ERE, we examined whether the interaction between the E203R-K210A mutant and the CT probe is transcriptionally productive. Whereas no estradiol-induced transcription could be detected with wt, K210A or E203R on a CT-tk-CAT reporter vector, the double mutant E203R-K210A gave rise to a detectable increase in estradiol-stimulated transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C).

The complete switch in DNA-binding specificity of the double mutant was confirmed using reporter vectors containing tandem response elements. No transactivation of the reporter vector containing EREs was observed in the presence of the double mutant after estrogen treatment, while peak stimulation of the reporter vector containing CT elements was comparable to that of wt ER&#x003b1; on the reporter containing consensus EREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D).

A possible reason for success in the rational design of artificial C2H2 zinc finger proteins is the modular structure of this type of DBDs, each finger recognizing three base pairs and multiple zinc fingers extending the length of bound DNA. On the other hand, steroid receptors bind DNA as dimers recognizing palindromic response elements. As dimerization contributes to the affinity of DNA binding, binding to non-palindromic sequences would likely be of low affinity. Nevertheless, the question remains whether steroid receptors can bind other DNA elements than their two natural cognate response elements. A previously proposed model for prediction of specific amino acid&#x02013;base interactions by the steroid receptor DNA-binding helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) incorporates both chemical rules governing amino acid&#x02013;base interactions and stereochemical constraints resulting from the position of the DNA recognition helix in the major groove of response element as determined by crystallographic studies. However, this model relies on one amino acid&#x02014;one base-pair relationships and ignores some of the contacts described in the ER&#x02013;ERE cocrystal structure. In particular, E203 recognizes not only the base at position +4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, bold line), but also that at position +3 (dotted line), and bases on the opposite strand make contacts with K210. On the other hand, the lysine residue corresponding to K210 in the context of the GR does not bind DNA, and its role in binding of ERs to EREs has not been experimentally confirmed.</p><p>Contrary to the GR and AR, which recognize motifs with variable base composition at position &#x02212;4 conforming to the PuGNACA consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), ERs display a high degree of specificity for bases at position &#x02212;4/&#x02212;3. GT was the only element bound with high affinity, while GG was tolerated when introduced in only one motif, such as in the ERE found in the promoter of the rabbit uteroglobin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), but reduced binding efficacy dramatically when introduced in both motifs. This binding pattern is consistent with chemical preferences of E203 for C or A at position +4 and +3, and of K210 for G or T at position &#x02212;4 and &#x02212;3, with restrictions imposed by steric constraints with either amino acids. Mutagenesis of each amino acid indicated that both contribute to recognition of the two central base pairs in terms of binding efficiency. E203 also plays a specific role in restricting binding to AT elements, since mutation E203A, but not K210A, allowed formation of complexes. Molecular modeling indicates that this is due to steric conflicts between the carbonyl group of E203 and the methyl group of thymine +4.</p><p>The contribution of K210 to ERE binding likely explains the fact that E203N and E203H mutants still interacted with high affinity with the consensus response elements (GT). Interactions with the AT element, which were not predicted by the proposed model, were observed in gel shift and transactivation assays with both E203N and E203H mutants, and likely result from removal of negative constraints exerted by E203 on T + 4, as observed also in the E203A mutant. Our modeling indicates that the methyl group of thymine can be accomodated by side chain rearrangement when E203 is replaced by N or H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A and B). On the other hand, lack of binding of the E203R mutant to all tested elements and of transcriptional activity on the consensus ERE and CT element can be explained by conflicts in charge preference between R203 and K210 for recognition of the same base pairs.

As noted above, the K residue in AR at the corresponding position does not contact DNA, explaining the capacity of the AR mutant with an R at the position equivalent to 203 to interact with G + 4. Another difference between the two receptors is the contribution of V at position 6 in the DNA recognition helix of AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) in complex stabilization. This may explain the relatively low affinity of the E203R-K210A mutant for the CT element. However, this interaction was transcriptionally productive. Surprisingly, similar levels of transactivation were obtained with the mutant receptor on the CT element as with the wt receptor on the consensus element at comparable protein concentrations along a range of amounts of transfected plamids, failing to reveal a different efficiency of reporter DNA saturation (data not shown). Titration curves of mutant E203N and E203H on the consensus ERE and AT element also failed to reveal a shift in protein concentrations necessary to reach peak transcriptional activity. This indicates that our <italic>in vivo</italic> assay may not discriminate between binding sites in the range of affinities that is observable in gel shift assay (within 30-fold of wt ER&#x003b1;-consensus ERE affinity) and may be due to synergism with other transcription factors for binding to our reporter genes <italic>in vivo.</italic> A higher stringency of <italic>in vitro</italic> versus <italic>in vivo</italic> assays is supported by the observation that half-palindromes, which are not bound in our gel shift assay, are enriched, albeit to a much lower degree than high-affinity EREs, in chromatin fragments bound by ER&#x003b1; in a genome-wide analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). On the other hand, our transactivation data confirms the total loss of interaction between the E203R-K210A and the consensus ERE and thus the switch in specificity toward the CT element.</p><p>Binding of the E203R-K210A to some unpredicted sites, i.e the AC element, reflects the limitations of simple models in fully accounting for the complex interactions between these residues and the two central base pairs. In addition, the expected binding of the E203H-K210A mutant to the CN palindromes and of the E203N-K210A mutant to the TN elements were not observed. Replacement of E203 by N or H reveals that both residues are too short to interact with charged groups at position 6 or 7 of A (+4) or G (+4), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A and B). Finally, mutants E203H-K210A or E203N-K210A still bound the consensus ERE (GT element), contrary to what was observed with mutation E203R-K210A. The total abrogation of binding to the consensus ERE appears due to charge and steric conflict of R with C + 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C).</p><p>Together, our results indicate that simple chemical and stereochemical rules cannot predict accurately the changes in the selectivity of ER&#x02013;DNA interactions induced by specific mutations in the two central base pairs. A clear limitation is the need to incorporate the contribution of several amino acids to recognition of the same base pairs, and the role of one amino acid in recognizing two adjacent bases. The combined effects of E203 and K210 in interacting with the same bases is apparent both at the level of charge and steric constraints, resulting in the tighter DNA-binding specificity for the two central base pairs observed for ER versus other steroid receptors. Further, steric constraints play an important role in preventing potential interactions. Additional experiments will also be necessary to determine whether the effect of amino acid replacement at other positions in the ER&#x003b1; DNA-binding helix, which are involved in simpler one residue&#x02013;one base interactions, is more easily predictable. It remains possible that other receptors may be more amenable to the rational design of mutant receptors with altered DNA-binding specificity, due to differences in composition of the DNA-binding helix and/or in the mode of DBD dimerization. In this respect, it will be of interest to investigate the DNA-binding specificity of non-classical <italic>C. elegans</italic> receptors, which contain widely diverging combinations of amino acids in their DNA recognition helix. Finally, combinatorial approaches as performed for C2H2 zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) may help clarify how amino acids of the DNA-binding helix cooperate toward the establishment of novel DNA-binding specificities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) grant to S.M.

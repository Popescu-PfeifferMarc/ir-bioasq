Our study shows that the (UUAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGAU) RNA sequence, from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1 polypurine tract or PPT sequence) forms <italic>in vitro</italic> a stable folded structure involving the G-run. We have investigated the ability of pyrimidine peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers targeted to the PPT sequence to invade the folded RNA and exhibit biological activity at the translation level <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells. We find that PNAs can form stable complexes even with the structured PPT RNA target at neutral pH. We show that T-rich PNAs, namely the tridecamer-I PNA (C4T4CT4) forms triplex structures whereas the C-rich tridecamer-II PNA (TC6T4CT) likely forms a duplex with the target RNA. Interestingly, we find that both C-rich and T-rich PNAs arrested <italic>in vitro</italic> translation elongation specifically at the PPT target site. Finally, we show that T-rich and C-rich tridecamer PNAs that have been identified as efficient and specific blockers of translation elongation <italic>in vitro</italic>, specifically inhibit translation in streptolysin-O permeabilized cells where the PPT target sequence has been introduced upstream the reporter luciferase gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA and RNA oligomers that contain consecutive guanine (G) nucleotides are capable of folding into stable secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes, wherein four Gs are hydrogen bonded together into a roughly square planar array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). G-quadruplexes are of remarkable stability and have been proposed to be involved in regulation of gene expression. For example, a DNA G-quadruplex structure formed in the <italic>c-myc</italic> promoter region functions as a transcriptional repressor element and an RNA G-quadruplex is believed to regulate alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA coding for hTERT, the reverse transcriptase component of the enzyme telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) contains the 5&#x02032;A<sub>4</sub>GA<sub>4</sub>G<sub>6</sub>A polypurine tract sequence (PPT) that is conserved in all HIV-1 strains and is present in the coding region of integrase (IN) and nef messenger RNAs. G-quadruplexes have been implicated in HIV-1 RNA dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and recently were shown to occur in a reverse transcription intermediate, namely between the overlapping strands of the HIV-1 central DNA flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). It has been shown that HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NCp) and gp 120 envelope protein exhibit a high affinity for several tetramolecular quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). RNA quadruplexes are more stable than their DNA counterparts and in most cases no dissociation is experimentally observed for G tracts involving five guanine quartets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have used peptide nucleic acid (PNA) targeted to the folded PPT sequence of HIV-1 messenger RNA. PNAs are DNA analogues in which the <italic>N</italic>-(2-aminoethyl) glycine units replace the deoxyribose phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). PNAs are capable of sequence specific recognition of DNA and RNA, obeying the Watson&#x02013;Crick hydrogen-bonding or/and Hoogsteen schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). The neutral amide backbone of PNAs increases their binding affinity to DNA and RNA and the hybrid complexes exhibit high thermal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). Short PNA probes were shown to be able to disturb and finally to bind folded RNA structures used as target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Here, we show that pyrimidine PNAs overcome kinetic and thermodynamic obstacles and succeed to hybridize to folded PPT sequence and finally to unfold it. We have examined whether complexes formed with PNAs on the PPT sequence, likely triplex and duplex structures, affect RNA translation elongation <italic>in vitro</italic>. The cellular antisense activity of the best inhibitors <italic>in vitro</italic> was tested in streptolysin-O (SLO) permeabilized cells stably transformed with two reporter genes, the firefly luciferase (<italic>luc</italic>) and GFP that contain upstream of the reporter genes either the wild-type HIV-1 PPT target sequence, or a mutated HIV-2 PPT sequence, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>The DNA, RNA and PNA oligonucleotides presented here were synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). 13-mer-Acr PNA was synthesized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).

For each experiment, in a 48-well dishes, 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells in 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;l were permeabilized by addition of an optimized amount of SLO (110&#x02009;ng) and then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 15&#x02009;min, in the presence of PNAs. Resealing was achieved by addition of 800&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and further incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;min.

In the same time, cells were examined with respect to permeabilization efficiency and viability by flow cytometry (Facsort, Beckton Dickinson).

The luciferase activity and GFP expression shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> were normalized to the absorbance data, that reflect the amount of proteins, and then expressed as a percentage compared with the luciferase activity and GFP fluorescence levels that were obtained in SLO-treated cells in the absence of PNA.

Several slow migrating species are detected with wild-type RNA (lane 1), while the derived 19-mer mutated RNA, RNA-III-mut, in which two adenines break the G-tract migrates faster and as a single species (lane 2). Such observations supports the involvement of the G-run in the structure of the RNA PPT sequence that likely adopts a quadruplex form. Indeed, stretches of guanines can associate through hydrogen bonding to form four-stranded structures. G-quadruplexes are of remarkable stability and have a preferential affinity for monovalent cations (typically K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup>) that exhibit a suitable size for interaction with the electronegative carbonyl oxygen ring inside the G-quartet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Recently, Mergny <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) have shown that the RNA sequence r-UG<sub>4</sub>U, forms extremely stable parallel RNA quadruplex that is much more stable than its DNA counterpart. The increased stability of RNA quadruplexes results from a faster association and a slower dissociation. Strand concentration and ionic environment plays an important role in the kinetics of quadruplex formation. In our case, the folded RNA structure was observed at very low 19-mer RNA-III-wt concentrations (2 nM) in the absence of added monovalent ions. One explanation is that this 19-mer RNA sequence is already folded after the synthesis and that during sample drying, setting in solution and dilution, the folded structure is maintained. This is not astonishing insofar as the lifetime of r-UG4U quadruplex at 37&#x000b0;C was estimated to be more than 100 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The multiple bands of RNA-III-wt can be assessed to folded structures isomers. We have used in our studies different batches of synthesis and always observed the same profile of migration. NaOH addition to the RNA-III-wt showed a shift of the folded structures to an unfolded structure, which migrated at the same position as mutated RNA-III-mut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Folded structures titration by NaOH allowed the determination of a mid-point transition from structured-RNA-III-wt to RNA-III-wt monomer at 9&#x02009;mM NaOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).

We postulated that retarded low mobility species result from the fixation of PNAs to the A-rich region of the target sequence not engaged in the structure formed by the G-tract while high mobility complexes result from the invasion of RNA structures by 13-mer-I and 13-mer-II PNAs.13-mer-II PNA that can form six C.G base pairs invades slightly more efficiently folded RNA than 13-mer-I PNA that can form only four C.G base pairs with the PPT RNA target. The binding of the two tridecamer PNAs was also studied on the mutated target, RNA-III-mut. This RNA sequence is not stably structured and is complementary on 11 and 8 contiguous nucleotides with 13-mer-I and 13-mer-II PNAs, respectively. Then, binding of 13-mer-PNAs can be also observed on this RNA sequence, with complexes migrating at the same position as the ones observed on the wild-type sequence after PNA-induced unfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Binding efficiencies of 13-mer-PNAs on the two RNA targets, wild type and mutated, was measured. For tridecamer-PNAs complexed to RNA-III-wt, we could not determine precisely the K<sub>50</sub> values (that means the concentrations of PNAs required for the formation of 50% of complex) because of the multiplicity of the slow-mobility complexes, however these values are situated between 2 and 5 nM. On the contrary, K<sub>50</sub> values can be determined on unstructured RNA-III mut; for unmodified and acridine-modified tridecamer-PNAs complexed to RNA-III-mut, K<sub>50</sub> was determined around 4 nM.

They are complementary both to the wild-type and the mutated sequence, to the A-rich region that is not involved in the structure of the PPT RNA. The 9-mer and 11-mer sequences were also used as bis-PNAs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for sequences), that were expected to bind efficiently to the PPT sequence. As expected, these short sequences bind to folded RNA-III-wt sequence and no unfolding was observed even at high PNA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), consistent with the fact that the target sequence is not involved in the structure. The 9-mer and 9-mer-bis PNAs, bind very efficiently to the wild-type and mutated RNA sequences. K<sub>50</sub> values are situated in the range of 2&#x02013;4&#x02009;nM. On the mutated RNA target, the complexes are well resolved; with the monomeric PNA 9-mer an unique complex is observed whereas with both bis-PNAs, 9-mer and 11-mer-bis PNAs, two discrete shifted complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>) were observed. In the case of 11-mer-bis PNA, there are two bands in complex C<sub>1</sub>. Probably, 11-mer-bis PNA forms with RNA-III-wt two structurally isomeric C<sub>1</sub> complexes. Similar structurally isomeric complexes formed between homopyrimidine bis-PNAs and single- and double-stranded DNA targets have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). At low bis-PNA concentrations, complex C<sub>1</sub> was predominant while at high concentrations complex C<sub>2</sub> was predominant. The complex C<sub>1</sub> formed with 9-mer bis-PNA migrates as complex formed with 9-mer PNA and corresponds to the triplex formed with the A<sub>4</sub>GA<sub>4</sub> purine sequence with two 9-mer PNAs. Complex C<sub>2</sub> can be assigned to the triplex formation with two bis-PNAs as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A. If it was the case, this complex would contain two free PNA strands that could form a PNA&#x02013;RNA&#x02013;PNA triplex with another RNA target. Indeed, upon addition of an excess of 19-mer RNA super-shifted complexes have been obtained with 9-mer bis-PNA and 11-mer bis-PNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B shows that in the presence of 400&#x02009;nM PNAs, almost the totality of the RNA-III-wt was converted in slow migrating (s) and fast migrating (f) complexes depending on PNA sequences. Upon addition of an excess RNA-III no change in the migration of complexes were observed except for complexes formed with 11-mer-bis and 9-mer-bis PNAs that were super-shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). These results support a model where each bis-PNA molecule participates in the triplex structure with only one arm; the second arm of each bis-PNA remains free (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, complex C<sub>2</sub>). It is noteworthy that the lifetimes of complexes formed with RNA-III-wt are higher than those formed with RNA-III-mut as upon addition of an excess of target RNA followed by 5&#x02009;min of incubation, partial dissociation of PNA&#x02013;RNA-III-mut complexes was observed, whereas PNA&#x02013;RNA-III-wt complexes were not dissociated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>PNA<sub>2&#x02013;</sub>RNA triplexes resist to denaturing gel conditions</title><p>In order to explore the stability of folded RNA and of its complexes with different PNAs we loaded the samples on denaturing acrylamide (7&#x02009;M urea) gel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows that wild-type RNA structures and complexes with PNA resist to the denaturing conditions.

For the two PNA tridecamers, 13-mer-I and 13-mer-II, the melting profiles are very different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>); the heating and cooling curves are superimposed for the 13-mer-II in contrast to that is observed for the 13-mer-I. In the latter case, temperatures of dissociation and association depend on the heating rate, supporting non-equilibrium conditions during experiment which gave rise to hysteresis phenomenon. This observation is consistent with duplex formation with 13-mer-II PNA and triplex formation with 13-mer-I PNA since triplex formation is known to be slower than duplex one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). At acidic pH the melting curves of 13-mer-II PNA were similar to those obtained at neutral pH, suggesting that cytosine protonation is not involved in complex stability as expected for triplexes formed with C-rich third strand (data not shown). Altogether, these results suggest that tridecamer PNAs form at neutral pH stable complexes involving duplex (13-mer-II) or triplex (13-mer-I). To better characterize the complex formed with the 13-mer-I PNA on the PPT RNA, melting profiles were performed with the 9-mer PNA that forms a triplex on the A<sub>4</sub>GA<sub>4</sub> sequence.

The two tridecamer PNAs that form at neutral pH very stable complexes, likely involving duplex (13-mer-II) or triplex (13-mer-I) formation with target PPT RNA, specifically inhibit translation in SLO-permeabilized cells. In the present study, we show that tridecamer PNAs are as efficient as 18-mer phoshoramidate oligonucleotide, also administrated by a SLO procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), to act as antisense molecules by binding to the complementary RNA target, present in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region of a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Moreover, while the phosphoramidate 18-mer, complementary to the PPT sequence did not exhibit, <italic>in vitro</italic>, any inhibitory effect when targeted to the coding portion of the mRNA, tridecamer PNAs very efficiently arrested translation elongation with concomitant synthesis of truncated peptide. Interestingly, this steric blockage of translation elongation was not only observed with T-rich triplex-forming PNAs as already described but also with C-rich duplex-forming PNAs. Our results open new perspectives for the development of such PNAs that can be targeted to any RNA sequence, to produce intracellularly truncated proteins of interest including dominant negative versions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Fabio Cannata for technical assistance.

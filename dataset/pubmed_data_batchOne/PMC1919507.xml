There are two isoforms of topo II (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;) that have limited functional redundancy, although their catalytic mechanisms appear the same. Using their COOH-terminal domains (CTDs) in yeast two-hybrid analysis, we have identified phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) as a binding partner of both topo II &#x003b1; and &#x003b2;. Although predominantly a plasma membrane protein involved in phosphatidylserine externalization, PLSCR1 can also be imported into the nucleus where it may have a tumour suppressor function. The interactions of PLSCR1 and topo II were confirmed by pull-down assays with topo II &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; CTD fusion proteins and endogenous PLSCR1, and by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous PLSCR1 and topo II &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. PLSCR1 also increased the decatenation activity of human topo II&#x003b1;. A conserved basic sequence in the CTD of topo II&#x003b1; was identified as being essential for binding to PLSCR1 and binding of the two proteins could be inhibited by a synthetic peptide corresponding to topo II&#x003b1; amino acids 1430-1441. These studies reveal for the first time a physical and functional interaction between topo II and PLSCR1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoforms of mammalian DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) decatenate double-stranded DNA and are involved in numerous cellular processes including replication, gene transcription, chromosomal segregation, differentiation and apoptosis as well as playing an important role in chromatin structure and remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Topo II&#x003b1; is found mainly in proliferating cells and its expression levels vary substantially in different phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In contrast, topo II&#x003b2; is expressed at constant levels throughout the cell cycle and in a broad range of cell types, with higher expression levels during embryogenesis and in tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Topo II&#x003b2; has also been implicated in cellular maturation and differentiation in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The two mammalian isoforms have comparable catalytic activities in that both can complement functional defects in yeast that conditionally lack the single yeast topo II isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). However, <italic>Top2a</italic>-/- mice die early in embryogenesis because nuclei fail to divide properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), while <italic>Top2b</italic>-/- mice die at birth due to defects in diaphragm muscle innervation and have significant abnormalities in neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Thus, topo II&#x003b1; is essential for cell division, while topo II&#x003b2; serves a critical role in development.</p><p>In addition to their roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation, topo II &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; are well-established targets in cancer chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). Clinically important and widely used topo II-targetting drugs such as doxorubicin and etoposide are considered topo II poisons because they stabilize cleaved DNA/enzyme complexes, leading to the induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Other drugs are known as catalytic inhibitors and act at different stages of the topo II catalytic cycle, such as when topo II binds to DNA or ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). There is a substantial body of compelling evidence indicating that changes in topo II expression, function and/or localization can play a major role in the response of cancer cells to drugs that target these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16 B17">13&#x02013;17</xref>).</p><p>Both topo II &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; consist of three domains: the NH<sub>2</sub>-proximal ATPase domain, the central DNA cleavage and religation domain (both of which are highly conserved), and the divergent COOH-terminal domains (CTDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Mutant topo II&#x003b1; lacking its CTD retains activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that the CTD has more of a regulatory function rather than being essential for catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The CTDs of topo II contain most of the utilized phosphorylation sites which are COOH-proximal to the enzymes&#x02019; nuclear export sequences (NES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24">21&#x02013;24</xref>). The CTDs also contain nuclear localization sequences (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and mutations in these sequences (at least in topo II&#x003b1;) lead to cytosolic localization of the protein and confer drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Quite recently, Linka <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) reported convincing evidence that the topo II CTDs are important determinants of the isoform-specific functions of these enzymes.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that human topo II&#x003b1; and topo II&#x003b2; both participate in protein&#x02013;protein interactions with a diverse range of nuclear proteins, including p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), retinoblastoma protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein and c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), 14-3-3&#x003b5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and caspase-activated DNase (CAD) nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). However, there is evidence that the screens for topo II protein binding partners to date have been incomplete. In the present study, by using yeast two-hybrid analysis with the CTDs of topo II &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; as &#x02018;bait&#x02019;, we have identified phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) as a novel binding partner of both isozymes. While the majority of studies of this primarily plasma membrane localized protein have focused on its role in phosphatidylserine externalization during apoptosis, PLSCR1 is also actively imported into the nucleus, where it appears to have a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Since topo II is involved in proliferation (&#x003b1; isoform) and differentiation (&#x003b2; isoform), and both isoforms are known to have a role in the cellular responses to cytotoxic drugs, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that interactions between topo II and PLSCR1 may influence tumour cell growth and drug responsiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>&#x02018;Bait&#x02019; plasmids pOBD2/topo II&#x003b1;1152-1531 and pOBD2/topo II&#x003b2;1165-1621 were prepared by PCR amplification of pBS/hTOP2 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and pYEShTOP2B (gift of Dr. I.

As the identification of protein&#x02013;protein interactions can often provide insight into regulatory pathways, we undertook a search for novel topo II binding partners using yeast two-hybrid analysis. The sequence divergent topo II CTDs were used as bait because there is compelling evidence that many of their regulatory elements are contained in this region.</p><p>Since topo II &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; are normally localized to the nucleus, we initially found it surprising that our analysis identified PLSCR1, which is primarily localized to the endofacial plasma membrane in most cell types, as a topo II-binding protein. However, PLSCR1 can also be found in the nucleus and other organelles, albeit at much lower abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). A non-classical functional NLS has been identified in PLSCR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) and it has been demonstrated that PLSCR1 binds to a unique site in the nuclear import carrier protein importin &#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Thus, there is strong evidence that under certain conditions, PLSCR1 is actively imported into the nucleus making its interaction with topo II <italic>in vivo</italic> feasible.</p><p>PLSCR1&#x02009;at the plasma membrane is multiply palmitoylated which, like other forms of lipid modification, often induces or enhances membrane localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). The factors that regulate PLSCR1 palmitoylation are not known, nor is it known precisely how palmitoylation affects the non-plasma membrane localization or function of this protein. However, when palmitoylation of PLSCR1 is inhibited, either by mutation of the palmitoylated cysteines in the COOH-proximal end of the protein or by treatment of cells with 2-bromo-palmitate, PLSCR1 becomes primarily localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Since the conditions used to prepare samples for the topo II pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays in the present study would be expected to yield predominantly palmitoylated and unpalmitoylated PLSCR1, respectively, our observations suggest that palmitoylation does not affect the interaction of PLSCR1 with topo II &#x003b1; or &#x003b2;, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, because both topo II isoforms are almost exclusively found in the nucleus, it would seem likely that they interact primarily with unpalmitoylated PLSCR1 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Protein&#x02013;protein interactions involving both yeast and human topo II have been reported to result in several different functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31 B32 B33">26&#x02013;33</xref>). In some cases, the topo II&#x02013;protein interactions modulate the DNA decatenating activity of the enzyme which is critical for regulated chromosomal segregation. Thus, HDAC1 and the underphosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma protein inhibit the DNA decatenating activity of human topo II&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) while in contrast, the cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), the mitotic cdc2 cyclin-dependent kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and CAD nuclease stimulate this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Our data indicates that PLSCR1 behaves like the latter proteins in its ability to stimulate DNA decatenation by topo II&#x003b1;.</p><p>To better understand the molecular basis of the interaction between topo II and PLSCR1, we investigated the region of topo II&#x003b1; responsible for its binding to PLSCR1. Using a series of nested truncated GST-fusion proteins in pull-down assays, a basic stretch of amino acids (residues 1432-1441) in topo II&#x003b1; in a region of the enzyme that is predicted to be unstructured was shown to be critical. The importance of these amino acids was confirmed by demonstrating that a synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to this sequence could inhibit binding of topo II and PLSCR1. However, while topo II&#x003b1; residues1432-1441 are essential, it remains possible that they are not sufficient by themselves to mediate the interaction between the two proteins. Other proteins reported to bind to the topo II CTD include HDAC1 and HDAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). It will be of interest to determine the relationships, if any, among the different topo II CTD binding proteins (which now includes PLSCR1) with respect to topo II functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Most studies of PLSCR1 have focused on its role in phospholipid mixing at the plasma membrane. More recently it has been suggested that PLSCR1 may have a role in suppressing tumorigenesis. For example, when human ovarian tumour cells stably transfected with PLSCR1 were implanted into athymic mice, the resulting tumours were much smaller and more differentiated than those arising from untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Additionally, Huang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) showed that induction of PLSCR1 arrested proliferation of human myeloid leukemia cells and stimulated their differentiation. Elevated PLSCR1 mRNA levels have also been reported to be a positive prognostic factor in a clinical study of patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). In contrast, when transplanted into syngeneic or athymic mice, an NH<sub>2</sub>-truncated form of murine Plscr1 (designated as TRA1) is leukemogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Ongoing studies are aimed at determining how the tumour-suppressor effects of PLSCR1 might be related to its effects on topo II activity.</p><p>The function(s) of nuclear PLSCR1 is presently not well understood. Recently, a domain within the putative NH<sub>2</sub>-proximal regulatory region of PLSCR1 was shown to stimulate expression of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1), a protein involved in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum, by binding directly to its promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). It may be that PLSCR1 participates with other nuclear proteins to regulate expression of IP3R1 and possibly other genes by recruiting topo II or alternatively, topo II recruits PLSCR1 to specific regions of DNA in order to regulate topo II activity. For the topo II-nuclear protein interactions characterized thus far, it is the interacting protein partner that appears to be recruited by topo II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). For example, it has been shown that chromatin remodelling occurs in response to topo II-mediated recruitment of the mitotic cdc2 cyclin-dependent kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>).</p><p>IP3R1 seems unlikely to be the only gene regulated by PLSCR1 and indeed, PLSCR1 has been reported to bind to promoter fragments from three other uncharacterized genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). PLSCR1 did not induce transcription from these promoter fragments in a luciferase reporter assay, an observation that could be explained if PLSCR1 is acting as a negative regulator of these genes or if a necessary adaptor protein was not present in the cells used. It has also been shown that nuclear levels of PLSCR1 can be enhanced substantially by treatment of at least some cell types with both type I and II interferons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Whether or not the ability of PLSCR1 to modulate topo II activity is involved in the cellular activities of interferons, however, remains to be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, our study shows for the first time a physical and functional interaction between topo II and PLSCR1. Further investigation of the interactions between these proteins is needed to better understand their possible role in tumour proliferation, as well as cellular differentiation and drug responsiveness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Ms Kathy Sparks for expert technical assistance.

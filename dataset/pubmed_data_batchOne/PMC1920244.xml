Many medically important viruses, such as influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Ebola, can form filamentous particles when budding. Although filamentous virions have been previously studied, details of how viral filaments bud from the plasma membrane remain largely unknown. Using molecular beacon (MB)-fluorescent probes to image the viral genomic RNA (vRNA) of human RSV (hRSV) in live Vero cells, the dynamics of assembled viral filaments was observed to consist of three primary types of motion prior to egress from the plasma membrane: (i) filament projection and rotation, (ii) migration and (iii) non-directed motion. In addition, from information gained by imaging the 3D distribution of cellular vRNA, observing and characterizing vRNA dynamics, imaging vRNA/Myosin Va colocalization, and studying the effects of cytochalasin D (actin depolymerizing agent) exposure, a model for filamentous virion egress is presented.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Several medically important enveloped viruses that infect the respiratory tract, such as influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">4&#x02013;8</xref>), and parainfluenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) virus, form both spherical and filamentous virions at the surface of infected cells. This has been observed both in cell culture models with high passage, laboratory strains, and from virus isolated directly from nasopharyngeal secretions or observed in pathology samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It has been shown that in influenza, filamentous virions have a higher specific infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), and it has been theorized that the filamentous virus morphology may be more effective for both infecting cells and evading the host immune responses, particularly in the respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>One important question about the filamentous virion is: What are the mechanisms by which these virions bud from the plasma membrane of an infected cell? To answer this question, we chose as our model system the A2 strain of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), grown in non-polarized Vero cells. Since many aspects of virion assembly and replication have been studied with RSV, this system is ideal for the study of filamentous virion egress. To image the live-cell dynamics of the genomic viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) of hRSV, a molecular beacon (MB)-fluorescent probe was designed to target specifically the vRNA. This allowed for direct observations of both the morphology and mechanics of the processes leading to viral egress within the cellular context. This approach has significant advantages over the DIC (differential interference contrast) method used in the previous dynamics study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) of RSV, which lacked molecular specificity and the contrast needed to observe vertically oriented virions.</p><p>Molecular beacons are dual-labeled, nucleic acid probes with a reporter fluorophore at one end and a quencher at the other. They are designed to form a stem-loop hairpin structure so that fluorescence emission occurs only when the probe hybridizes to a complementary target, resulting in a high signal-to-background ratio (SBR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Although MBs have been used in limited live-cell mRNA studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14 B15 B16">12&#x02013;16</xref>), their potential for the analysis of viral RNA in living cells has only recently been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Other methods for imaging RNA in live cells, including the use of fluorescently labeled full-length RNAs or RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22">19&#x02013;22</xref>) and GFP-fused RNA-binding proteins (GFP-MS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), do not allow for the evaluation of unmodified viral particles.</p><p>For the imaging experiments, a single chimeric MB, with a DNA backbone stem and 2&#x02032;-O-Methyl RNA backbone hybridization domain, was designed to target a gene-end-intergenic-gene-start sequence, 3&#x02032;-UUU UUA CCC CGU UUA U-5&#x02032;, that has three exact repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Successfully used in antisense experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), this site was considered the most accessible and therefore a prime site for probe hybridization. Targeting the repeated sequence provided signal amplification, resulting in a significantly increased SBR. In addition, since the target RNP is concentrated in cytoplasmic granules, often called inclusion bodies, and in viral filaments, which contain multiple copies of the vRNP, the signal was further enhanced. A 2&#x02032;-O-Methyl RNA/DNA chimera design was used for the MB primarily because of its generally higher SBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) when binding to RNA. This enhanced our ability to observe viral RNA being packaged into filamentous virion (SBR ranging from 11 to 30 using chimera versus less than 5 using DNA), and is likely due to 2&#x02032;-O-Methyl RNAs higher affinity for RNA than DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29">27&#x02013;29</xref>). The enhanced nuclease resistance is also a positive feature of using 2&#x02032;-O-Methyl RNA for the hybridization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), but we did not ever observe evidence of active probe degradation with DNA or chimera probes. The lack of probe degradation is likely due to the use of streptolysin O-based delivery, which avoids the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).

Infected cells were live-cell labeled with the hRSV specific MB as discussed above. Thirty minutes after live-cell MB hybridization, cells were fixed with room temperature (RT) 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) in nuclease free PBS for 10&#x02009;min. They were then washed twice with 1&#x000d7; PBS and incubated in 5% RNase-free BSA (Fisher Scientific, Horsham, PA) in 1&#x000d7; PBS for 60&#x02009;min at RT. They were then washed twice with 1&#x000d7; PBS and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of mAb RSV3206 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for 60&#x02009;min at RT. After being washed twice with 1&#x000d7; PBS for 5&#x02009;min, the cells were then incubated with a 1:400 dilution of Alexa 488-goat-anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

For staining vRNA and myosin Va, the vRNA was labeled in live-cells with the MB as mentioned above, fixed as mentioned above, but in addition were permeabilized 0.1% Triton X in 1&#x000d7; PBS for 3&#x02009;min, followed by a 1&#x000d7; PBS wash after fixation. The primary antibody used was a rabbit polyclonal to myosin Va (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:100 dilution in PBS; the secondary antibody used was an Alexa 488-goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>Cytochalasin D treatment</title><p>In order to further understand the role of actin in the dynamics of viral genomic RNPs, MBs were delivered into Vero cells 2-day PI. Thirty minutes after MB delivery the cell media were removed and replaced with their normal growth media with 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml of cytochalasin-D bodipy FL (Invitrogen). Time-lapse epifluorescence imaging of the cells was performed at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO2, immediately after the media were changed for &#x0223c;15&#x02009;min. Out of focus light was removed using ImageJ &#x02018;background subtraction&#x02019; in order to improve the contrast of the filaments shown. No other alterations were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>3D reconstructions</title><p>Fixed cell images (in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1&#x000d7; PBS) of vRNPs or vRNP/myosin Va co-stained samples were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope with a 100X Plan-Neofluor objective (NA = 1.3). The pinhole for the confocal microscopy was set such that each image is 0.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m thick, with 0.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m between images, and up to 31 images (&#x0223c;15&#x02009;&#x003bc;m in the z direction) were taken. Bitplane was utilized to reconstruct the z-stack images. This enabled the actual length of the vRNPs to be measured, not just the 2D projection length.</p></sec><sec><title>Live-cell imaging</title><p>All of the live-cell imaging performed was with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 epifluorescence microscope equipped with an internal shutter, and a Zeiss Axiocam MRm cooled CCD camera. Control of the internal shutter and image acquisition was performed using Zeiss Axiovision 4.4. Chroma filter sets 41007a and 49002 were used to image the Quasar570 and Alexa 488 fluorescence, respectively. All images were taken with a 100X EC-Plan-Neofluor objective (NA = 1.3). Fixed cell imaging was performed in 4-well, Nunc Labtek II chambered coverslips (#1.5), while all live-cell imaging was performed with Bioptechs DeltaT black dishes with a #1.5 coverslip for a bottom. The live cells were kept at 37&#x000b0;C using the Bioptechs DeltaT4 system and objective heater, and in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air environments via a port in the heated lid of the DeltaT4 system.</p><p>Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (NIH) v. 1.33u, or using Bitplane by Imaris. ImageJ was utilized to produce the image sequence data from the time-lapse images of vRNP dynamics, and to false color the images. The only modification to the time-lapse images was the mapping of the 8-bit gray scale to the &#x02018;fire&#x02019; color maps in ImageJ. No other changes to the images were performed. SBR measurements were performed with the background intensities of both the non-infected and infected cells being the same value. Only linear changes were made to equilibrate their backgrounds. In addition, ImageJ and Bitplane were used to analyze the motion of vRNPs and the length of filamentous vRNPs. This information was then used in Microsoft Excel to calculate the mean square displacement (MSD) of the vRNPs as a function of time, and the filament length distribution.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Molecular beacons were delivered into a confluent monolayer of Vero cells 2-day PI with the A2 strain of hRSV, as well as non-infected Vero cells, using reversible cell membrane permeabilization with streptolysin O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), in order to determine both the specificity of the MB probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and characterize the morphologies of the vRNPs. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, infected cells exhibited strong fluorescence with signal concentrated in spherical inclusion bodies (average SBR of 80) and individual viral filaments (average SBR of 11), while the non-infected cells were quite dark, demonstrating excellent probe specificity. The infection was confirmed using PCR; infected cells exhibited a very high level of hRSV amplicon, unlike the non-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). To demonstrate probe accessibility for vRNPs that were in the process of being packaged, we fixed the hRSV-infected cells after delivering MBs, and then co-stained for the RSV F protein with indirect immunofluorescence. The F or fusion protein is a membrane glycoprotein that mediates viral fusion and entry, and also promotes fusion of the infected cell membrane with adjacent cell membranes, leading to the formation of syncytia. We observed significant image overlap of the filamentous MB signal with that from the anti-F-protein antibody on the surface of the cells, indicating that MBs can bind to vRNPs localized to the inside of the plasma membrane in the midst of the packaging process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). In addition, the F protein and MB signal colocalization implies that the RNPs are located throughout the filament.</p><p>In order to better describe the morphologies observed using MB imaging in the infected cells, 30&#x02009;min after MB delivery, the cells were fixed, imaged with confocal microscopy and later reconstructed in three dimensions using Imaris Bitplane. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, four images showing only the fluorescent information at distances greater than 12, 8, 4 and 0&#x02009;&#x003bc;m from the glass surface are shown. The 0&#x02009;&#x003bc;m view represents all of the signal from the bound MBs within the infected cells displayed in two dimensions; the cross section is &#x0223c;15&#x02009;&#x003bc;m thick from the coverglass to the tops of the viral filaments (as represented by the fluorescent signal). Both cytoplasmic inclusions and viral filaments are easily viewed and measured, with the upper 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;m (perpendicular to the image plane) dominated by filaments. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, one <italic>XZ</italic> and <italic>YZ</italic> cross section are shown. In these cross-sectional views, the filaments are easily seen protruding from the curved, apical side of the cells, while the inclusions are distributed throughout the cytoplasm, but often closer to the apical membrane than the coverslip. The filament lengths from the 3D reconstructions were measured in Bitplane, and the distribution is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C. The distribution is log-normal, ranging from &#x0223c;2.6 to 8.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, with an average filament length of 4.6&#x02009;&#x003bc;m and a SD of 1.54&#x02009;&#x003bc;m. This is very consistent with prior measurements of filament length measured using electron microscopy; Armstrong <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) quoted lengths up to 2.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, Norrby <italic>et al</italic>.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) up to 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, and measurements by Roberts <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) quoted a range from 4 to 8&#x02009;&#x003bc;m. In addition, we found that some filamentous vRNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, white circles) are connected at one end, with average angles of &#x0223c;71.4 &#x000b1; 3.5&#x000b0;, which is very similar to morphologies formed by the actin network near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).

Images of infected cells were taken using 100&#x02013;200&#x02009;ms exposures, with 5&#x02009;s between exposures for up to 15&#x02009;min, after which photobleaching became significant. Twelve image sequences were taken per experiment and 10 experiments were performed, yielding 120 time-lapse movies. After analyzing the movie sequences, three primary modes of motion were identified: (i) filament projection and rotation, (ii) migration, and (iii) non-directed motion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and Supplementary Movie 1, filamentous vRNPs on the surface of the cells rotated dramatically on one end after a period of little motion. A quantitative analysis indicated that the vRNPs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A exhibited little rotation for &#x0223c;250&#x02009;s, then rapidly rotated to a near vertical position relative to the cell membrane within 50&#x02009;s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The average rate of rotation after the vRNPs appeared to separate from the membrane was &#x0223c;1.67&#x000b0;/s. Once the vRNPs became vertical, they either continued to rotate rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and Supplementary Movie 2), with a rate &#x02264;6&#x000b0;/s, or they migrated over short distances, exhibiting the second mode of motion observed (migration). It should be noted that the filamentous groups of vRNPs observed while rotating are flexible in nature. An example of a flexible filament can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, panel two (5&#x02009;s, where the filament appears &#x02018;bent&#x02019;), and panel three (10&#x02009;s, where the filament appears curved) and in Supplementary Movie 2. The flexibility of RSV nucleocapsids has previously been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), but were not observed in real-time during the egress process.

(<bold>C</bold>) Once the vRNPs are vertical, two types of motion were observed, violent rotation (see Supplementary Movie 2) or migration. A time series of the rapid rotation of packaged vRNPs is shown here; where within 15&#x02009;s, the vRNPs pictured here rotate 69.4&#x000b0;. (<bold>D</bold>) The flexibility of RSV filaments is shown in this time-lapse sequence. The RSV filament appears both &#x02018;bent&#x02019; and exhibits curvature at both 5 and 10&#x02009;s from the initial time of observation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm246f3"/></fig></p><p>A typical example of the migration mode can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and Supplementary Movie 3, where a vertically oriented vRNP migrated &#x0223c;2.8&#x02009;&#x003bc;m in 50&#x02009;s; the path of the vRNP is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B. Prior to and after this migration, the particle is static. The path taken by the particle is very similar in morphology to that of lipid rafts (see inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B) as imaged using an Alexa 488-labeled cholera toxin probe. We hypothesize that the raft acts as a guide for the particle path, which is consistent with the observation that vRNP packaging occurs in the lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34 B35 B36">33&#x02013;36</xref>). The speeds observed of &#x0223c;25 migrating filaments ranged from &#x0223c;29.5 to 102 nm/s with an average speed of 56&#x02009;nm/s, while the path lengths traveled ranged from &#x0223c;1 to 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;m, with an average path length of 2.36 &#x000b1; 0.9&#x02009;&#x003bc;m. The speeds measured are commensurate with myosin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>); myosin has been implicated in RSV viral protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and given the connection between lipid rafts and the actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), myosin-driven transport likely plays a role in RSV virion egress.

This evidence, in conjunction with previous studies of RSV filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36">34&#x02013;36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42 B43 B44 B45 B46">42&#x02013;46</xref>), points to motor driven transport on the cytoskeleton as the likely driver of the observed migratory motion, and possibly the rotational motion. Previous studies of RSV have demonstrated that actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) and their growth, mediated by profilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and rhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), are vital to virion egress. In many of those studies, infected cells were exposed to cytoskeletal depolymerizing agents. The amount of free virion or viral RNA in the cell culture media, or changes in virion morphology, as measured via immunofluorescence imaging, were used to gauge the effect of these agents on virion egress. In previous studies, actin depolymerization via cytochalasin D had the most adverse effects on virion egress, therefore making actin/myosin the most likely cytoskeletal/motor combination involved in the motion observed in our investigation. In addition, since assembly occurs at the lipid rafts and the rafts are linked to the actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), depolymerzing them should effect the observed motion.</p><p>Live-cell MB hybridization, cell fixation and permeabilization, followed by immunostaining of myosin Va, and confocal microscopy imaging was performed in order to confirm the presence and possible role of myosin. Myosin V has previously been implicated in trafficking messenger RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), granules on the actin network near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), and RSV proteins to the apical membrane in polarized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The results from our simultaneous labeling experiments can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, where the blue represents myosin Va, the red represents vRNPs (hybridized MBs) and the purple represents their colocalization. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, four images showing only the fluorescence information at distances greater than 9, 6, 3 and 0&#x02009;&#x003bc;m from the glass surface are shown. The 0&#x02009;&#x003bc;m view represents all of the fluorescent signal from within the infected cells, displayed in two dimensions; the cross section is &#x0223c;12&#x02009;&#x003bc;m thick from the coverglass to the tops of the viral filaments. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, <italic>XZ</italic> and <italic>YZ</italic> cross-sectional views are shown, with crossed lines representing where they were taken in the <italic>XY</italic> plane. From the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B, it can be seen that the filaments are largely distributed along the apical surface, and that they colocalize well with myosin Va (purple color). Throughout the volume of the cell monolayer, both myosin Va (blue), represented as small dots, and vRNPs (MB, red), predominately in cytoplasmic inclusions, do not colocalize and appear independent. It is clear from this figure that the strongest colocalization occurs predominately in the filaments and near the surface of the monolayer, implicating myosin Va's role in the assembly and egress process.

We observed that many filamentous vRNPs exposed to cytochalasin D, tended to aggregate and form circular, inclusion-like structures of vRNPs within &#x0223c;1&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and Supplementary Movie 6). Two minutes later, these circular aggregates tended to move from the surface of the cell into the cell cytoplasm. After 15&#x02009;min, almost all of the vRNPs had separated from the cell surface and were concentrated in granules. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, a typical syncytia is shown; high concentrations of filamentous structures surround the syncytia, while a lower density of filaments and particles lie along the apical membrane. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C, a syncytia 15&#x02009;min after cytochalasin D exposure composed of predominately circular granules. This experiment helps confirm filamentous actin's role in governing vRNP morphology, and explain why virion egress is decreased when actin filaments are depolymerized.

Presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A&#x02013;D are sketches of the possible actin network/nucleocapsid interactions for all three types of motion discussed above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A and B represents how vRNP rotation might be achieved. Myosin motors, attached to the vRNP and moving along the actin network, could cause the virion to flip up on one end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), given that actin filaments are quite flexible. It is possible that this motion frees much of the virion from the plasma membrane, allowing for more rigorous rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) or migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The rigorous rotation may cause the separation of daughter actin strands within the virion from mother strands at the Arp2/3 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). The dissociation constant for Arp2/3 with the mother strand is &#x0223c;50 times higher than with the daughter strand, and thus the weakest part of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This separation would then allow the virion to leave the cell. The initiation of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) may be the result of myosin motors as a part of the virion, and their intermittent function once the vRNPs are physically separated from the actin network. This is supported by our observation of myosin Va colocalization with vRNPs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). Non-directed motion or anomalous diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C) may occur for several reasons; for example, if vRNPs lack the ATP necessary to cause directed motion or if the vRNPs are separated from the actin network via the ADF/cofilin mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) too early and not by mechanical motion, they may be left trapped within the plasma membrane. It is also possible that these virions were released from an infected cell earlier and reabsorbed, or they are involved in genome replication, and not competent for egress. Future studies of the protein/vRNP interactions at the membrane are required to reveal the exact reasons of the non-directed motions, and identify conclusively the proteins involved in this process.
<fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Hypothesized biophysical model of vRNP motion. (<bold>A</bold>) Active myosin V motor proteins, attached to both the viral genomic RNP and the actin network, cause the rotation of the virion and partial separation from the plasma membrane, via their translation along the actin network. (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) Once the virion is partially free from the cell surface due to vigorous motion (B), motor motion could possibly cause daughter actin filaments within the virion to break from the mother filaments at the Arp2/3 protein complex, allowing for rigorous rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and Supplementary Movie 2) or (C) migration along the actin network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and Supplementary Movie 3). (<bold>D</bold>) Some particles exhibit &#x02018;non-directed&#x02019; or obstructed diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C and Supplementary Movie 4), possibly due to the action of the ADF/cofilin complex leaving it embedded in the membrane without the actin network/motors to propel it from the cell.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm246f7"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p>

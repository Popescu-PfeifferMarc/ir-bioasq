We now present a novel study of rate control by eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) using yeast strains in which chromosomal eIF genes have been placed under the control of the <italic>tetO7</italic> promoter system. The results reveal that, contrary to previously published reports, control of the initiation pathway is distributed over all of the eIFs, whereby rate control (the magnitude of their respective component control coefficients) follows the order: eIF4G&#x02009;<bold>&#x0003e;</bold>&#x02009;eIF1A&#x02009;<bold>&#x0003e;</bold>&#x02009;eIF4E&#x02009;<bold>&#x0003e;</bold>&#x02009;eIF5B. The apparent rate control effects of eIFs observed in standard cell-free extract experiments, on the other hand, do not accurately reflect the steady state <italic>in vivo</italic> data.

This process is performed by large macromolecular machines composed of proteins and rRNA molecules. These ribonucleoprotein complexes, called ribosomes, each comprise a small subunit and a large subunit that cooperate to decipher (translate) the information encoded in mRNA molecules. Recruitment of the small (40S) eukaryotic ribosomal subunit onto a cellular mRNA generally occurs via the capped 5&#x02032;end. Since the AUG start codon of a gene can be located many hundreds (in some cases thousands) of nucleotides downstream of the 5&#x02032;end, the 40S subunit then has to translocate (scan) along the mRNA to reach the initiation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). This processive, sequence-independent scanning phase involves at least 11 eukaryotic initiation factors [eIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>)], equivalent in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to at least 21 proteins, that participate in a series of different complexes, as well as a number of (largely undefined) conformational states. The control of translation initiation is a key determinant of growth, is important to the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and, when malfunctional, contributes to disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). It is therefore important to understand rate control of this process at a quantitative level. Moreover, as understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying eIF function progresses, we will be able to fit them into a quantitative framework that can serve as a robust model for the overall process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Binding of the ternary complex (comprising Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup>, eIF2 and GTP) to the 40S subunit is stabilized by eIF1A and eIF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Yeast eIF3 binds to eIF2, thus promoting binding of mRNA to 40S; mammalian eIF3, on the other hand, seems to be capable of binding (in an RNA-dependent manner) directly to the 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). eIF4F is anchored to the 5&#x02032;end of the mRNA via the cap-binding protein eIF4E which, despite its small size, may play roles in a number of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Genetic experiments in yeast have indicated that eIF1, eIF2 and eIF5 influence start codon selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), while <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical experiments have shown that eIF1 and eIF1A play roles in scanning and formation of the 48S complex, which comprises 40S, the eIFs and mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). A growing body of evidence indicates that, at least in budding yeast, eIF1, eIF2, eIF3 and eIF5 may bind to the 40S subunit as a preformed multifactor complex (MFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Thus the MFC components, together with eIF1A, play a key role in 40S-mRNA recruitment, scanning of the 5&#x02032; untranslated region, and start codon recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>). Recognition of the start codon in an mRNA leads to hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP, followed by 60S joining aided by eIF5B-GTP. Hydrolysis of the latter GTP precedes initiation of protein synthesis.

However, thinking on the rate control of processes such as translation has been influenced by the expectation that control is usually determined by a single rate-limiting step. For example, it has frequently been suggested or assumed that eIF4E acts as a rate-limiting factor in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">16&#x02013;20</xref>). This approach to posttranscriptional gene expression probably derives from early models of metabolic control, widely disseminated in biochemistry teaching texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>), in which it has been assumed that one enzyme-catalysed step would be responsible for rate control through each pathway. On the other hand, uncertainty about the role of eIF4E in rate control has been created by contrasting observations of the effects of artificially enhanced eIF4E synthesis in primary cell cultures as opposed to cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>Up to now, translation has not been subjected to detailed quantitative control analysis, and therefore the mode of control in the translation initiation pathway could not be precisely elucidated. In this article, we address the issue of rate control in the translation initiation pathway using genetic titration combined with control analysis of eIF synthesis rates <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have chosen to perform this work in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the eukaryotic organism with the best-defined translation system as well as the eukaryotic organism of choice for attempts to achieve comprehensive characterization of metabolic and genetic pathways in the coming years. Studies of this relatively simple eukaryote are far more readily integrated into coherent models of rate control than are the largely qualitative results derived from the diversity of dissimilar higher eukaryotic systems under study. In our study, we find that control follows a distributed model in which all steps investigated contribute to the determination of overall rate, albeit to differing degrees. The approach taken here has broad relevance for research on gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of doxycycline-regulatable eIF strains</title><p>pCM225 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) was employed as template for PCR amplifications of the promoter-substitution cassettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).

Complementation of the doxycycline-inducible phenotypes of strains PTC209, 210, 229, 230 was achieved via transformation using plasmids expressing the eIF-encoding genes.

Antibodies against eIF4E and eIF1A were generated by immunization of rabbits with the purified factors (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Antibodies against eIF4G1 were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), while an anti-eIF5B serum was kindly provided by Tom Dever (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The membranes were incubated with FITC-labelled anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), washed and then scanned using a Typhoon Imager (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Translation in cell-free extracts was studied as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Each quantitation experiment was repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of rate control data</title><p>We applied basic concepts derived from metabolic control analysis (MCA), which was originally developed to examine the relative control exerted by each step in a metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), to the translation initiation pathway. Specifically, we applied the concept of the sensitivity coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), which expresses the dependence of a variable of the system (in this case the flux through the pathway, i.e. the translation initiation rate) on the rate of a certain step in the pathway. The original term referred to the effects of changes in enzyme concentration on catalytic flux through a metabolic pathway. The component control coefficient, as defined here, refers to the effect of changes in the concentration of a component engaged in the assembly of a macromolecular complex that has catalytic activity. This coefficient is defined at the steady state as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkm283i1.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>J</italic> is the flux through the system (in this case the translation rate).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Imposed modulation of eIF synthesis</title><p>Our overall aim was to analyse key steps of control at the three major phases of the initiation pathway: 40S recruitment, 40S scanning leading to AUG recognition, and ribosomal subunit joining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). In order to do this, we placed transcription of the chromosomal genes encoding eIF4E and eIF4G (<italic>CDC33</italic> and <italic>TIF4631</italic>, respectively; 40S recruitment), eIF1A (<italic>TIF11</italic>; scanning and AUG recognition) and eIF5B (<italic>FUN12</italic>; subunit joining), under the control of the Tet-off operator system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). We chose both eIF4E and eIF4G because there has been a long-standing debate in the field as to whether eIF4E, as opposed to any other factor acting on the initiation pathway, acts as the &#x02018;rate-determining&#x02019; factor in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">16&#x02013;20</xref>).</p><p>The doxycycline-dependent slow-growth phenotypes of the strains could be suppressed by genetic complementation upon transformation using expression plasmids bearing the corresponding wild-type genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Additionally, PCR was used to confirm the structure of the chromosomal insertions (data not shown). We next tested whether the four strains constructed as described earlier would allow us to regulate synthesis continuously over a wide range of steady-state levels. Calibrated western blot analysis was used to quantitate the abundance of each eIF over a range of doxycycline concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, B, C, D and E). These &#x02018;genetic titrations&#x02019; enabled us to investigate the relationship between intracellular eIF levels and the rates of cell growth and of protein synthesis over a range that does not become excessively restrictive to cell function (see below). In control experiments, we investigated whether the levels of eIFs whose synthesis was not subject to Tet-off regulation were affected by doxycycline (data not shown). The results revealed that, in each of the four strains, only the eIF encoded by the <italic>tetO7</italic>-regulated gene was subject to limitation.

Growth limitation by doxycycline was explored down to a growth rate of &#x0003c;20% of wild type, thus providing a broad range of data points for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F). Control experiments revealed no effects of doxycycline upon growth of a strain that did not have a gene subject to control by the Tet-off control system. We also followed the rate of protein synthesis <italic>in vivo</italic> as a function of eIF abundance in the steady state. Polysomal gradients revealed shifts in the distribution of ribosomes from the polysomal fractions into the monosomal fractions (see SupplementaryData), and indicated differences in the sensitivity of the initiation pathway to comparable changes in abundance of the four eIFs.</p><p>In order to obtain a more exact picture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, B, C and D), we determined the rates of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine incorporation into cells. Plotting these rates versus relative abundance of each eIF, we were then able to identify the quantitative differences between them in terms of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). A remarkable feature of the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> is that they all seem to approximate to a biphasic structure, with a break at 80% of maximum [eIF] or higher between two regions of distinct <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> values. One possible explanation for this behaviour is that progressively reducing the amount of intracellular eIF at some point restricts the redundancy of the macromolecular assembly routes, thus limiting eIF binding to a route that has a higher <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> value. Irrespective of the mechanistic basis for this effect, the most relevant region in terms of normal assembly of the translation initiation apparatus is the region with the smaller <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> value that is observed at higher eIF concentrations&#x02014;this tells us the contribution to control of each eIF at or near its wild-type level in the cell.

Here we have developed the concept of the component control coefficient (<italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup>) for a macromolecular assembly pathway (see Materials and Methods section). The strength of rate control (component control coefficients) declined in the order: eIF4G &#x0003e; eIF1A &#x0003e; eIF4E &#x0003e; eIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E). The rationale for calculating the component control coefficients as we have done in this work is summarized in the Materials and Methods section. The largest <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> value obtained at near wild-type levels was 0.50 for eIF4G1. This means that for every change of 2% in [eIF4G1], the rate of initiation changes by 1%. Rate control imposed by eIF5B, in contrast, is more than three times weaker.</p><p>In control experiments, we examined whether the abundance of typical endogenous mRNAs in the constructed strains is affected by <italic>tetO7</italic>-regulated changes in eIF gene transcription rate. We quantitated the abundance of a typical long-lived mRNA (<italic>PGK1</italic>) and of a typical short-lived mRNA (<italic>MAT&#x003b1;1</italic>) in the strains listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> as a function of doxycycline addition. In all cases, doxycycline-induced inhibition of <italic>tetO7</italic>-regulated eIF production had no effect on mRNA abundance (data not shown). We, therefore, conclude that the changes in protein synthesis rate associated with reductions in the intracellular availability of the selected eIFs are not likely to be attributable to reduced mRNA stability. This finding is fully consistent with our earlier observations that reduced eIF activities, at least over a certain range, do not cause general destabilization of mRNA in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>A truly rate-limiting factor would have a <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> value of 1, and as we can see from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, all of the eIF <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> values determined here fall far short of 1 (in the near-wild-type concentration range). This unpredicted result therefore tells us that the eIFs share rate control of the overall pathway, and that no single eIF exercises complete rate control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). A further key issue relates to the summation rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), which states that the sum of all control coefficients should equal 1. More recent results have indicated that this sum can in fact be &#x0003e;1 (approaching 2) for metabolic pathways if there is macromolecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) or where the enzymes on a pathway exchange substrate groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Our data now show that rate control summation in the translation initiation pathway, and therefore probably in other macromolecular assembly pathways, follows a different rule to that applicable to most metabolic pathways.

However, we need to bear in mind that as protein synthesis is attenuated, this affects cell growth and physiology that in turn could, at least theoretically, feed back on the rate control relationships of the respective factors. A useful indication of the global state of the cell as a function of changes in the rate of protein synthesis is provided by the plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, which derive from the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and in the Supplementary Data section. In all four cases, growth is tightly linked to protein synthesis rate, with some variation in the slope. This suggests that there is a common fundamental relationship between growth and protein synthesis, with only a small dependence on which eIF is mediating limitation, thus simplifying the analysis and interpretation of the rate control data. However, it should be noted that we have not characterized the influence of changes in the cell physiological state on the <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> values estimated here, which would be necessary for hierarchical control analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) of this system. Thus the control relationships we describe can only be assumed to apply to the log phase growth conditions specified.

Analysis of translation rate as a function of total eIF present in each extract revealed that the apparent control effects exercised by eIF4E and eIF1A in the lower concentration ranges were much greater than in the comparable <italic>in vivo</italic> states. The relationship between translation rate and eIF1A abundance in the extract from strain PTC229 grown in the presence of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, and compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C) did not approximate to the type of biphasic form seen <italic>in vivo</italic>, showing instead a region of very strong dependence on factor concentration leading to a (non-responsive) plateau. On the other hand, the dependence of translation rate on eIF4E concentration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A includes a region of intermediate factor dependence. In control experiments, it was found that extracts prepared from the same strains grown in the absence of doxycycline showed relatively minimal responses to the addition of eIF4E or eIF1A (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). This minimal response was slightly higher in the case of PTC209. This was most likely because the chromosomal <italic>tet-off</italic> construction in this strain directed a somewhat reduced maximal (non-suppressed) rate of <italic>CDC33</italic> transcription, and thus of eIF4E synthesis, compared to the level directed by the wild-type promoter (data not shown).

The procedure utilized here could be applied to all of the macromolecular assembly pathways based on intermolecular interactions and different conformational states, thus building up an increasingly accurate picture of control across the network of intracellular interactions that are involved in gene expression. Establishing this common quantitative framework for representation and modelling of the control and regulation of gene expression should be generally useful.</p><p>Our study illustrates how quantitative control data provide important insight into the workings of a complex biological system. The data show that rate control is distributed over different steps (and different eIFs) in the initiation pathway. It was noted previously that distributed rate control could be an inevitable consequence of the action of evolutionary &#x02018;forces&#x02019; on a pathway of this type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). An additional outcome is that there is no simple relationship between intracellular eIF concentration and a factor's contribution to control of the system. Thus, eIF4E is significantly more abundant in yeast cells than are eIF1A and eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), yet its <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> value is far from proportionately smaller than those of these other two factors. In other words, it is unwise to base any judgments of likely control strength of a component of such a pathway on intracellular abundance alone. This consideration is also relevant to any models of disease caused by mutationally induced deficiencies in eIF function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>), since the quantitative data presented here show that we need to abandon the assumption that any particular eIF commands full control over the rate of the overall pathway under any particular set of conditions.</p><p>It is of course essential to remember in a study of this type that at least eIF1A and eIF4G may act at more than one site on the initiation pathway, and thus that each <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> value for these proteins represents the sum of multi-site action. This does not detract from the usefulness of these values as quantitative indicators of factor-centric control as manifested by the system under the defined conditions, but does mean that any mechanistic interpretation must take the multi-site functions into account. In this context, for example, it is remarkable that despite being involved in several steps on the initiation pathway, eIF1A manifests a <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> value that is only 16% greater than that of eIF4E, a factor that is thought to have a single site of action on the pathway.</p><p>In relation to potential targets for regulation of translation initiation, it is notable that the comparable <italic>C</italic><sup>J</sup> values of three of the eIFs studied in this work make them all potentially effective sites for targeting regulation. Thus, the observation of distributed control in the translation initiation pathway also tells us not to assume that regulation is likely only to be effective if targeted to one or two of the characterized eIFs. Finally, the current study sets the stage for comprehensive rate control analysis of this, and other, eukaryotic gene expression pathways. This will ultimately lead to the discovery of new general control principles that guide such systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p>

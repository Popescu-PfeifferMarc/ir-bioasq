To discover novel cytokine-receptor interactions, an advanced support vector machines (SVMs) model, CytoSVM, was constructed in this study. This model was iteratively trained using 449 mammal (except rat) cytokine-receptor interactions and about 1 million virtually generated positive and negative vectors in an enriched way. Final independent evaluation by rat's data received sensitivity of 97.4%, specificity of 99.2% and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.89. This performance is better than normal SVM-based models. Upon this well-optimized model, a web-based server was created to accept primary protein sequence and present its probabilities to interact with one or several cytokines. Moreover, this model was applied to identify putative cytokine-receptor pairs in the whole genomes of human and mouse. Excluding currently known cytokine-receptor interactions, total 1609 novel cytokine-receptor pairs were discovered from human genome with probability &#x0223c;80% after further transmembrane analysis. These cover 220 novel receptors (excluding their isoforms) for 126 human cytokines. The screening results have been deposited in a database. Both the server and the database can be freely accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.xmu.edu.cn/software/cytosvm/cytosvm.php">http://bioinf.xmu.edu.cn/software/cytosvm/cytosvm.php</ext-link>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The binding of cytokines to their receptors on cell membranes triggers the cellular activities such as immunological regulation, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and migration in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Therefore, characterization of novel cytokine-receptor pairs becomes the shortcut to understand these cytokine-mediated signal pathways.</p><p>The traditional isolation and characterization methods for identification of cytokine-receptor pairs are significantly limited by their characteristics of short half life, low plasma concentrations, pleiotropy and redundancy. It has been improved by the applications of modern molecular technologies such as cloning technology. Furthermore, as a complementary solution to experimental approaches, searches for new members of cytokines or their receptors are now often conducted by identifying genes highly homologous to known cytokine/receptor genes. Currently, 203 human cytokine-receptor pairs have been characterized as presented in KEGG pathway database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Unfortunately, it has become more and more difficult to discover new partners of cytokine and receptor if no new sequence features were identified. Especially for those peptides without significant sequence similarity to known cytokines/receptors, their functions are difficult to be probed on the basis of homologous or clustering methods.</p><p>Various alternative methods for describing protein interactions have been developed in recent years. These include evolutionary analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), Hidden Markov Models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), structural consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>), protein/gene fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), motifs recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), family classification by sequence clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and functional family prediction by statistical learning methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Support vector machines (SVMs) is a two-class classifier, which has been previously used in the classification of cytokine families (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinfo.tsinghua.edu.cn/%7Ehn/CTKPred/index.html">http://www.bioinfo.tsinghua.edu.cn/%7Ehn/CTKPred/index.html</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In this study, we constructed an improved SVM model, CytoSVM, for the identification of cytokine-receptor interactions on the basis of protein primary sequences. This model was further applied to screen the whole genomes of human and mouse for novel cytokine-receptor pairs.</p></sec><sec><title>CONSTRUCTION OF CytoSVM MODEL</title><p>CytoSVM is a model based on the statistical learning algorithm, SVM. This algorithm has been well-studied and implemented to solve a variety of protein classification problems including protein functional class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), fold recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), analysis of solvent accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), prediction of secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). As a method that uses sequence-derived physicochemical properties of proteins as the basis for classification, SVM may be particularly useful for functional classification of distantly related proteins and homologous proteins of different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Such a feature makes SVM a potentially attractive method for probing the novel cytokine receptors, especially when the diversity of cytokine receptors in sequence cannot be properly handled by sequence homology-based approaches.</p><sec><title>The data sets</title><sec><title>The positive data pool</title><p>The positive data (the true cytokine-receptor interactions) were collected from the KEGG pathway database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and the literatures. These interaction pairs cover 449 distinct known cytokine-receptor interactions in mammals except rat. To be eligible for model construction, every sequence was represented by specific feature vector assembled from encoded representations of tabulated residue properties including amino acid composition, hydrophobicity, normalized Van der Waals volume, polarity, polarizability, charge, surface tension, secondary structure and solvent accessibility for each residue in the sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19">15&#x02013;19</xref>). A positive vector of interaction pair was formed by joining the vectors of the cytokine and its complementary receptor. To enlarge the positive data pool, four virtual vectors were generated around each positive vector by slightly (about 1/1000 folds) increasing/decreasing the value of vector elements in multi-dimension space. As a result, total 2243 positive data (449 true positives and 1794 virtual positives) were prepared for model training.</p></sec><sec><title>The negative data pool</title><p>The negative data pool includes both the true and the virtual data. The true negatives are literature-reported 126 non-cytokine&#x02013;protein interactions, which are very limited in the representation of sequential and structural features of non-cytokine&#x02013;receptor interactions. To cover all possible negative conditions, a large number of virtual negative interaction pairs were generated as follows: 7816 seed sequences representing diverse domain families, excluding those containing any known cytokine or its receptor, were extracted from Pfam protein families database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). These Pfam seeds were paired with, covering all possible combinations, mammal cytokines to form the virtual negative interactions. Same transformations from sequences to vectors were demonstrated to these negative interaction pairs as described earlier. Totally, about 1 million negative data were ready in negative data pool.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>The SVM algorithm</title><p>The theory of SVM has been well described in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The structural and physicochemical features of a protein interaction are represented by a feature vector quantified from its primary sequence as described earlier. The vector is projected into a hyperspace wherein a hyperplane is used to classify this protein interaction pair as either positive (cytokine&#x02013;receptor interaction) or negative (non-cytokine&#x02013;receptor interaction) depending on the side of the hyperplane the vector is located. In this study, an RBF kernel function <italic>K</italic>(<italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>,&#x02009;<italic>x<sub>j</sub></italic>) was adopted to map the input vector into a high dimensional feature space:
<disp-formula id="M1"><label>1</label><graphic xlink:href="gkm254m1"/></disp-formula>
The output of SVM model is the respective class of input, directly associated with the posterior probability by fitting a sigmoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>):
<disp-formula id="M2"><label>2</label><graphic xlink:href="gkm254m2"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is the output of SVM, and the parameters <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> are estimated from the negative log likelihood of the training data. A higher probability indicates the higher confidence of positive prediction.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation and performance measure</title><p>As in the case of all discriminative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), the performance of SVM classification can be measured by: the quantity of true positives <italic>TP</italic>, true negatives <italic>TN</italic>, false positives <italic>FP</italic>, false negatives <italic>FN</italic>, sensitivity <italic>SE</italic>&#x02002;=&#x02002;<italic>TP/</italic>(<italic>TP</italic>&#x02002;+&#x02002;<italic>FN</italic>) which is the accuracy of cytokine&#x02013;protein interaction prediction and specificity <italic>SP</italic>&#x02002;=&#x02002;<italic>TN/</italic>(<italic>TN</italic>&#x02002;+&#x02002;<italic>FP</italic>) which is the accuracy of non-cytokine&#x02013;protein interaction prediction. The overall performance of the model can be measured both using the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) below:
<disp-formula id="M3"><label>3</label><graphic xlink:href="gkm254m3"/></disp-formula>
and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). ROC plot is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate for the different possible thresholds of a model test. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is usu-ally adopted as a scalar measure that gauges one facet of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In this study, ROC plot (Please refer to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.xmu.edu.cn/software/cytosvm/help.htm#roccurve">http://bioinf.xmu.edu.cn/software/cytosvm/help.htm#roccurve</ext-link>) and AUC were used to compare the performance of different SVM models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). It is shown that the enriched-SVM model with virtual positives (model M1) has the best performance, which was chosen to classify the cytokine&#x02013;receptor interactions.

To represent all negative sequential and structural features and at the same time reduce the very unbalance between positive and negative data, the vectors in negative data pool were randomly divided into 230 groups of about 4200 negative vectors. These 230 negative data groups were combined with the 2243 positive data respectively to form totally 230 data sets for the construction of model. These data sets were arranged in the way of: 229 groups were used for independent trainings, while the remaining one was left for testing.</p><p>The SVM model was initialized by 229 independent model trainings and optimized through several rounds of training in an enriched way. The negative support vectors (vectors close to the hyperplane on negative side) that decide the hyperplanes of the 229 independent models were extracted to form a new negative data pool. This pool was further arranged into groups for next round of learning process. The iterative learning process, or enriched selection of support vectors, was continued to seek the global optimally separating hyperplane (OSH) until the positive and negative data come to a near balance, of which the ratio is about 1:3 in this case. The optimized model was first tested by the remaining data set to assess its theoretical performance, which achieved sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 99.98% and MCC of 0.99. Considering the &#x02018;overfitting&#x02019; problem due to the overtraining on the same data set, the model was further independently evaluated by 79 real cytokine&#x02013;receptor interactions and 2360 generated negative data in rat, achieving sensitivity of 97.4%, specificity of 99.2% and MCC of 0.89 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Such performance is comparable to other computational approaches in protein&#x02013;protein interactions.

As a complementary method to homologous-based methods and other computational approaches in protein&#x02013;protein interaction prediction, CytoSVM shows its capability in functionally annotating those proteins that possess poor sequence similarity to known proteins. The application of CytoSVM in the discovery of novel cytokine&#x02013;receptor interactions in genome scale broadens the understanding of cytokines&#x02019; physiological activities in the systematic level. Via these predicted interactants, the identification of novel cytokine-involved cellular processes is possible. Furthermore, it prompts the identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of various diseases. It is thus expected that experimental verifications could be demonstrated according to the clues provided by our study in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#30400573) and the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) of MOE and Xiamen University are gratefully acknowledged.

However, little is known about the impact of higher order folding on DNA repair enzymes. We examined the catalytic activities of purified human base excision repair (BER) enzymes on uracil-containing oligonucleosome arrays, which are folded primarily into 30&#x02009;nm structures when incubated in repair reaction buffers. The catalytic activities of uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) and apyrimidinic/apurinic endonuclease (APE) digest G:U mismatches to completion in the folded oligonucleosomes without requiring significant disruption. In contrast, DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol &#x003b2;) synthesis is inhibited in a major fraction (&#x0223c;80%) of the oligonucleosome array, suggesting that single strand nicks in linker DNA are far more accessible to Pol &#x003b2; in highly folded oligonucleosomes. Importantly, this barrier in folded oligonucleosomes is removed by purified chromatin remodeling complexes. Both ISW1 and ISW2 from yeast significantly enhance Pol &#x003b2; accessibility to the refractory nicked sites in oligonucleosomes. These results indicate that the initial steps of BER (UDG and APE) act efficiently on highly folded oligonucleosome arrays, and chromatin remodeling may be required for the latter steps of BER in intact chromatin.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA is a constant target of spontaneous hydrolysis at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Two frequent hydrolysis reactions are depurination to produce non-coding abasic (AP) sites, and deamination of cytosine to generate uracil (U) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Minor base lesions and single-strand breaks are repaired primarily by base excision repair (BER) in mammalian cells. The first step of BER is removal of the damaged base by a DNA glycosylase, cleaving the <italic>N</italic>-glycosyl bond between the base and deoxyribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This results in forming apurinic or apyrimidic (AP) sites in DNA. As noted earlier, AP sites can also occur from depurination or depyrimidination yielding a common intermediate in BER. Subsequently, AP-endonuclease 1 (APE) incises the damaged strand 5&#x02032; to the AP-site generating a 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl and a 5&#x02032; deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Then, short-patch BER proceeds by action of DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol &#x003b2;), filling the single-nucleotide gap and removing the dRP group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Finally, the nick is sealed by DNA ligase I or III. Generally, replication and transcription are not significantly stalled at these types of base lesions. As a result, they can be mutagenic if not repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) resulting in genomic instability and such chronic disorders as cancer.</p><p>BER enzymes must deal with damage generated throughout the genome, and the majority of eukaryotic DNA is packaged into highly condensed structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). As shown in previous studies <italic>in vitro</italic> using mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), BER enzymes are significantly suppressed in mononucleosomes. However, recently, considerable flexibility of mononucleosome DNA has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), particularly at the sites of entry and exit from the nucleosome. Such dynamic properties of nucleosomes may allow certain small proteins to gain access to DNA. For example, it was found that Dnmt3a and Dnmt1 DNA methyltransferases act more efficiently on nucleosome DNA than naked DNA, and do not require disruption of histone octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Furthermore, Thoma and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) have shown that UV photolyase, a light-dependent DNA repair enzyme, recognizes and repairs CPDs in nucleosomes within seconds in intact yeast cells, suggesting this protein takes advantage of nucleosome dynamics to gain access to CPDs in chromatin.</p><p>Although dynamic properties of nucleosomes may contribute to the accessibility of DNA, they are not sufficient for some bulky proteins or protein complexes to gain access to internal sites. Indeed, several different types of chromatin remodeling factors have been identified that assist DNA accessibility. One class of these factors changes histone-DNA contacts by adding or removing covalent modifications from histone tails. Another class alters chromatin structure in a non-covalent manner using ATP hydrolysis, and this class has been subdivided into different families based on the ATPase subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The effect of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling on overall DNA repair has been shown using mono- or di-nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Recently, we reported that the SWI/SNF remodeling complex facilitates nucleotide excision repair (NER) of UV damage in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, the question of whether chromatin remodeling is required prior to damage recognition or during DNA repair has not been addressed. Furthermore, the initiation of DNA repair in highly compact chromatin remains an essential component for the understanding of BER in cells. Most BER enzymes are essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), making it more difficult to assess this pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, a complete understanding of DNA repair <italic>in vivo</italic> will remain elusive until the impact of higher order chromatin folding on repair enzymes is understood. Therefore, we are establishing conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> that more closely resemble physiologic templates <italic>in vivo</italic> to study BER in chromatin.</p><p>In this work, the process of short-patch BER was studied <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified human BER enzymes and highly folded oligonucleosomes containing DNA with uracil at different sites. We measured the efficiency of uracil removal by UDG and APE from G:U mismatch base pairs in oligonucleosomes reconstituted with 12 tandem repeats of a 208&#x02009;bp segment (208&#x02013;12) of <italic>Lytechinus variegates</italic> 5S rDNA. In addition, we examined the effect of yeast chromatin remodeling complexes ISW1 and ISW2 on Pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis in these oligonucleosome arrays. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining DNA repair at the 30&#x02009;nm oligonucleosome fiber level of DNA packaging in chromatin and linking chromatin remodeling with BER.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of uracil-containing template DNA</title><p>Linearized plasmid pSL208-12 was denatured in freshly prepared NaOH (0.32&#x02009;M) and mixed with 2&#x000d7; volume of 2% low melting agarose. Before it solidified, the mixture was transferred to mineral oil to form a bead. Each bead contained &#x0223c;500&#x02009;ng/&#x003bc;l of DNA. A 5&#x02009;M sodium bisulfite solution was mixed with 0.2 volume hydroquinone solution, and the pH adjusted to 5.0. Freshly prepared sodium bisulfite solution was added gently to the tube containing a bead. The tube was covered with foil and incubated at room temparature for 15&#x02009;min. Following chemical treatment, the bead was washed 10 times with 1&#x02009;ml TE buffer. Desulfonation was carried out by suspension in 0.2&#x02009;M NaOH for 10&#x02009;min, followed by extensive washing in TE buffer overnight. DNA was then extracted from the agarose beads, annealed, and digested with restriction enzymes to generate 208-12 templates for further use. The reaction was optimized such that the majority of single-strand DNA fragments received 1&#x02013;2 uracils.</p><p>Reconstitution of nucleosomal arrays&#x02014;Histone octamers were prepared from chicken erythrocyte nuclei as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

The degree of template saturation was controlled by varying the ratio of moles histone octamer to moles 208-bp DNA from 0.9 to 1.2. In our system, a ratio of 1.1 provided optimal efficiency of reconstitution.</p></sec><sec><title>EcoRI digestion assay</title><p>An aliquot of 700&#x02009;ng of oligonucleosomes (or naked DNA) was digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme in a buffer containing 10&#x02009;mM Tris, pH 8.0, 125&#x02009;mM NaCl, 2.5&#x02009;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1&#x02009;mM EDTA for 2&#x02009;h at 37&#x000b0;C.

A lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration was used than in previous studies to prevent oligonucleosomes from aggregating. Reactions were initiated by adding UDG and APE (1&#x02009;nM or 10&#x02009;nM final concentration), and incubations were carried out at 37&#x000b0;C for 0 to 1&#x02009;h. Aliquots were removed at different times and treated with phenol to stop the reaction. Digested DNA was resolved on denaturing alkaline gels, transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (GE Healthcare, England), probed with randomly labeled 5S rDNA fragments, and visualized on a PhosphorImager (model 445-P90, Molecular Dynamics).

Briefly, biotin-attached oligonucleotides, containing a sequence complementary to the 3&#x02032;-end of 208-12 DNA ([biotin]NNNNNNTTTTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTC), were synthesized and the biotin group was used to separate annealed fragments from the rest. The 6 Ns ensured full-length labeling of the fragment, and the 5 Ts allowed the annealed fragment to be extended with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dATP. Labeled fragments were separated in a 5.5% polyacrylamide denaturing gels.</p></sec><sec><title>Pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis</title><p>DNA synthesis with Pol &#x003b2; was performed in a mixture containing 50&#x02009;mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 2&#x02009;mM DTT, 0.2&#x02009;mM EDTA, 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml BSA, 10% glycerol (wt/vol), 4&#x02009;mM ATP, 5&#x02009;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP.

The experiments described in this report utilize a DNA fragment composed of 12 tandem repeats of a 208&#x02009;bp segment of the <italic>L. variegates</italic> 5S rRNA gene as a template for reconstitution of oligonucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Each repeat contains sequences that position nucleosomes both translationally and rotationally on the DNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). To study short-patch BER, uracil was incorporated at cytosine bases in the 208-12 DNA fragment by treatment with sodium bisulfite. This reaction was optimized to yield a majority of the single-stranded (ss) fragments with 1 or 2 uracils. For example, 35% of the fragments used for UDG/APE digestion (1&#x02009;nM each) contained a single uracil, 23% contained two uracils, and 15% of the fragments contained more than two uracils.

Initially, varying ratios (r) of histone octamers to 5S rDNA repeats were used for reconstitution to generate a fully loaded oligonucleosome array. To evaluate the degree of nucleosome loading, two different methods were used. First, gel mobility shift assays, following restriction digestion with EcoRI, were used. Since each repeat is flanked by EcoRI sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), a mononucleosome or 208-1 free DNA is released after EcoRI digestion. When only about 2&#x02013;5% of the 5S repeats are released in the free form, the 208-12 rDNA is considered to be fully saturated with nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). We obtained fully saturated oligonucleosomes when r = 1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Importantly, no significant differences in efficiency of oligonucleosome assembly were detected between intact 208-12 oligonucleosomes and those containing uracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). This result was expected since the G:U-mismatch has the capacity to form base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In addition, no additional disruption of the core particles was observed in the reconstituted oligonucleosomes in the BER reaction mixture buffer employed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>Sedimentation velocity analysis was also carried out to monitor the homogeneity of reconstituted oligonucleosome arrays, as well as the degree of salt-induced higher order structure formation. The majority of nucleosomal arrays both with and without uracil residues sediment as rather homogeneous populations of 28&#x02013;30S species in low ionic strength buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The small fraction of material with larger S values was due to super-saturated nucleosome arrays assembled with additional histones. Furthermore, as the BER buffer used in this study contains Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent folding of 208-12 oligonucleosomes was characterized. Hansen and colleagues have shown that saturated 208-12 nucleosome arrays form a maximally folded 55S structure in 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, with an extent of compaction equivalent to the classical higher order 30&#x02009;nm structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In the presence of 2&#x02009;mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, S values of both intact oligonucleosomes (open symbols) and uracil-containing oligonucleosomes (closed symbols) were shifted to higher values (more compact structures) in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). These results suggest that intramolecular folding of uracil-containing oligonucleosomes in solution is not disrupted in any significant way by G:U mismatches.</p><p>UDG and APE recognize and act on base lesions in folded oligonucleosomes. Incubation of either uracil-containing naked 208-12 DNA or oligonucleosomes with UDG and APE generates a single strand break that can be visualized on denaturing agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). When digested with 1&#x02009;nM each of UDG and APE, shorter bands are generated and the intensity of full-length (undigested) fragments is reduced during increasing digestion times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Furthermore, the disappearance of full-length fragments is slower with oligonucleosomes than with naked 208-12 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, graph), suggesting that the combined activity of these enzymes is reduced when DNA is folded into nucleosome arrays. The calculated initial rates for these digestion curves indicate that nucleosome arrays are digested &#x0223c;2&#x02013;3-fold slower by the combined action of UDG and APE. At higher enzyme concentrations (10&#x02009;nM each), however, the digestion reaction proceeded to near-completion with folded oligonucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). This result indicates that these enzymes can access G:U sites within higher order structures of chromatin and do not require a marked disruption of DNA-histone contacts.

Overall, incision at damaged sites within linker DNA regions (between ovals) was faster than in core DNA (within ovals). However, a few sites within each of the nucleosome core particles were cleaved considerably faster than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, red arrows). The rate of cleavage at these sites may reflect (i) the influence of flanking sequences in each of the 5S rDNA repeats, as observed for other DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), and/or (ii) the location of these sites at more accessible locations in the nucleosome cores (e.g. facing away from the histone surface in each nucleosome). In addition, some incised sites are detected within each of the repeats in the absence of UDG/APE digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, dotted arrows on left of 0&#x02009;min lane), indicating that some fragments contained nicks at specific sites following the sodium bisulfite treatment. Although DNA was treated for short times with high concentrations of bisulfite to limit these nicks, the glycosyl bond at purine residues is still susceptible to hydrolysis under acidic conditions. The resulting AP sites lead to single strand breaks during desulfonation under alkaline conditions. However, because these nicked sites do not change during the UDG/APE digestion, they serve as an intrinsic control for the enzyme-produced sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, dotted arrows).</p><p>Gap-filling by DNA Pol &#x003b2; is inhibited by oligonucleosome formation. To assess activity of Pol &#x003b2;, the single-nucleotide repair patch was labeled with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP. At a concentration of 1&#x02009;nM, Pol &#x003b2; efficiently incorporates dCMP into naked DNA and reaches a plateau after 90&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> inset, open circles). On the other hand, at this concentration, Pol &#x003b2; only incorporates dCMP into &#x0223c;20% of the sites in oligonucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> inset, closed circles). The oligonucleosome template used in this study includes about 60&#x02009;bp of linker DNA between nucleosome core particles (i.e. &#x0223c;30% of the total DNA). Therefore, folded nucleosomes may affect the efficiency of DNA synthesis in the linker DNA region. Indeed, even at a 10-fold higher concentration of Pol &#x003b2; (10&#x02009;nM), DNA synthesis on oligonucleosomes proceeded to a plateau of 37% in &#x0223c;60&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that nucleosome core particles are a formidable barrier for the efficient addition of nucleotides by Pol &#x003b2; in oligonucleosomes. Therefore, it is possible that other factor(s) assist this step in intact cells.

To investigate whether ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling facilitates Pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis, purified yeast remodeling complexes ISW1 and ISW2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) were tested with our BER-oligonucleosome model system. ISWI complexes induce nucleosome sliding both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), which makes DNA segments accessible while maintaining the overall packaging of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The ISWI complex is present in all eukaryotes, with the exception of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), and is relatively abundant. For example, ISWI is expressed during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development at levels as high as 100&#x02009;000 molecules/cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Moreover, ISWI induces nucleosome sliding on nicked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), which makes the ISWI remodeling complex a good candidate for assisting the Pol &#x003b2; step of the BER pathway in cells. A quantitative comparison of the synthesis of Pol &#x003b2; on oligonucleosomes in the absence and presence of these complexes was made by setting the maximum DNA synthesis achieved on oligonucleosomes in the absence of these factors to 1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, both of the yeast ISWI complexes promote efficient dCMP incorporation at cleaved uracil sites in the oligonucleosome templates. Indeed, after 4&#x02009;h, ISW1 and ISW2 increased incorporation by &#x0223c;4-fold and &#x0223c;6-fold, respectively. Thus, both remodeling complexes significantly increase the accessibility of nucleosome DNA to Pol &#x003b2;.

It has been shown that nucleosome structure reduces the accessibility of many different types of DNA processing proteins, and chromatin remodellers such as SWI/SNF enable the access by these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In the case of DNA repair, the question arises as to whether cells require chromatin remodeling prior to or during the repair process. Here, we show that two different chromatin states may be required for efficient BER by systematically examining BER <italic>in vitro</italic>, using highly folded nucleosome arrays of the 208-12 5S rDNA sequence, that more closely resemble natural substrates in intact cells than mono- (or di-) nucleosomes.</p><p>Uracil-containing DNA does not inhibit nucleosome formation or compaction. In this study, chemical deamination of cytosine to uracil was carried out to generate 1&#x02013;2 uracils/ss-fragment (i.e. &#x0223c;2&#x02013;4&#x02009;G:U mismatches in each array template). A G:U mismatch has the capacity to form a base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), which is most likely why these lesions do not affect nucleosome formation or compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This aspect of non-distorting DNA lesions makes their recognition more difficult than that of helix distorting DNA lesions such as <italic>cis-syn</italic> cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers caused by UV light, which bend the long axis of DNA &#x0223c; 30&#x000b0; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Furthermore, our sedimentation velocity results demonstrate that the reconstituted nucleosome arrays containing G:U mismatches form higher-order structures at increased ionic strength. Finally, cytosine deamination occurs more frequently where a segment of ssDNA is temporary exposed during transcription and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Our data supports the notion that such uracil-containing DNA can reassemble into nucleosomes and fold back into more compact structures in intact cells, if not repaired.</p><p>UDG and APE can access DNA base damage even in highly folded regions of chromatin. Differences occur in the activities of UDG and APE at different sites of oligonucleosomes, depending on the predicted rotational settings of the lesions as well as the flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), in agreement with previous studies on mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). More importantly, however, these enzymes digest the highly folded arrays to completion in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that both enzymes are capable of accessing dU-damaged sites within nucleosomes in a higher-order structure of chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, the strong inhibition of Pol &#x003b2; activity by oligonucleosomes following digestion with high concentrations of UDG/APE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) indicates there is no significant nucleosome disruption by UDG/APE digestion. Whether chromatin remodeling or recognition of DNA lesions would come first during BER in cells is unclear at this time. Phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX following induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by ionizing irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) is known to play an important role in recruiting DSB-recognition and repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), chromatin remodeling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and DNA damage-induced checkpoint proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). However, unlike induced DSBs, different types of minor base alterations occur constantly throughout the genome and, to date, there is no <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence showing that a specific histone modification is formed following DNA base damage. Our data suggests that, at least for BER, a variety of base lesions could be recognized directly by a substrate specific glycosylase in chromatin without requiring significant local chromatin remodeling. UDG and APE are relatively small, and bend the long axis of DNA only &#x0223c;20&#x000b0; and &#x0223c;35&#x000b0;, respectively, upon binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Such bending may be compatible with the DNA flexibility allowed on the nucleosome surface. Furthermore, such &#x02018;direct recognition&#x02019; by these enzymes may be critical for the cell to initiate BER in chromatin, especially in heterochromatin.</p><p>Pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis requires local chromatin remodeling. Unlike the UDG and APE enzymes, Pol &#x003b2; is strictly inhibited by the folding of DNA into nucleosome arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition to our previous observation on mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), our results clearly indicate that the major restriction of BER in oligonucleosome templates is the Pol &#x003b2; step. However, our new results indicate there are two levels of inhibition of Pol &#x003b2; in oligonucleosomes. At a lower concentration of Pol &#x003b2; (1 nM), &#x0223c;80% of the total gaps are not filled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, inset) in oligonucleosome arrays, which is equivalent to the portion of potential uracil sites (i.e. dC sites) in 168&#x02009;bp of nucleosomal DNA within the 208&#x02009;bp repeat. However, when the concentration of Pol &#x003b2; is increased 10-fold, &#x0223c;63% of total gaps remain unfilled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), which is almost equivalent to the fraction of potential uracil sites in the 147&#x02009;bp nucleosome core DNA (65%). This indicates that the outer 10&#x02009;bp of DNA at the points of entry and exit to the nucleosome are more accessible in oligonucleosomes than the inner 147&#x02009;bp of core DNA.</p><p>Pol &#x003b2; binding requires an &#x0223c;90&#x000b0; bend in the DNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), and such a radical distortion may not be tolerated by nucleosomes. This result may reflect the requirement for additional factor(s) to release the structural constraints of positioned nucleosomes in intact cells. Since BER intermediates such as single-strand breaks are also mutagenic, it is crucial that, once initiated, completion of BER occurs rapidly in cells. Therefore, we explored possible solutions for Pol &#x003b2; to overcome such structural barriers by examining the effects of two yeast chromatin remodeling complexes, ISW1 and ISW2, on Pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis in the oligonucleosome templates. Both of these complexes significantly facilitated Pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis on the folded oligonucleosome arrays <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This observation may reflect a need for ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling prior to the Pol &#x003b2; step of BER in chromatin.</p><p>Different chromatin structural states may be required for initial and latter steps of BER. Based on our results, we propose a mechanistic model for short-patch BER in chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). DNA glycosylases, which are relatively abundant for frequently occurring base damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), continually &#x02018;survey&#x02019; the genome and cleave glycosyl bonds of damaged bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Subsequently, APE, which is present at high amounts in cells (350&#x02009;000&#x02013;700&#x02009;000 molecules/cell), will incise at AP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Both of these enzymes may act directly on chromatin without requiring significant nucleosome disruption, possibly using the dynamic unwrapping of nucleosome DNA to gain access to internal nucleosome sites. In contrast, Pol &#x003b2; exists at lower levels in cells, &#x0223c;50&#x02009;000 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), and may only be able to access strand breaks in nucleosome-free DNA, or linker DNA regions. Access of UDG/APE-induced strand breaks within nucleosome core particles, however, may require nucleosome sliding or disruption prior to gap-filling synthesis. After removal of the dRP group by Pol &#x003b2;, the nick is sealed by DNA ligase. Completion of the repair process would then involve rearrangement of the repaired DNA back to the original chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).
<fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Schematic model of chromatin-remodeling during short-patch BER in chromatin. Damaged bases in chromatin are recognized and incised by a damage-specific DNA glycosylase and abundant APE. Chromatin-remodeling complex then locally disrupts nucleosomes to allow Pol &#x003b2; access to these single nucleotide gaps. Following gap-filling synthesis and removal of dRP group by Pol &#x003b2;, the nick is sealed by DNA ligase, and followed by nucleosome refolding.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm436f5"/></fig></p><p>Finally, Chambon and colleagues (51) reported that thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) associates with transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300. Thus, acetylation of histone tails by the CBP/p300-TDG complex may promote local chromatin relaxation at these sites. However, relaxation of closed chromatin structure to open form may only be sufficient for Pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis in linker DNA regions and may not be sufficient for access of Pol &#x003b2; to single-strand breaks in nucleosome core DNA. Indeed, preliminary results do not show a marked promotion of DNA synthesis on oligonucleosomes in the presence of a histone acetyl transferase (HAT1) (Nakanishi and Smerdon, unpublished results). Therefore, complete exposure of nucleosome core DNA, by either nucleosome sliding or disruption may be required to allow Pol &#x003b2; complete access to damaged sites. However, histone acetylation may have important roles in recruitment of additional factors, such as chromatin remodeling complexes, linking these two different chromatin states.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr Toshio Tsukiyama for helpful discussion and graciously providing yeast ISW1 and 2 remodeling complexes; Dr Jeffery C.

These cytotoxic ODNs all featured a 5&#x02032; G-rich sequence and induced cell death by a TLR9-independent mechanism. In this study, we examined the sequence and length dependence of ODNs for cytotoxicity. A G-rich sequence at the 5&#x02032; terminus of the molecule was necessary for cytotoxicity and the potency of ODNs with active 5&#x02032; sequences was length dependent. Cytotoxicity appeared to be generally independent of 3&#x02032; sequence composition, although 3&#x02032; sequences totally lacking G-nucleotides were mostly inactive. Nucleolin, elongation factor 1-alpha (eEF1A) and vimentin were identified as binding to a cytotoxic ODN (Dz13) using protein pull-down assays and LC-MS/MS. Although these proteins have previously been described to bind G-rich ODNs, the binding of eEF1A correlated with cytotoxicity, whereas binding of nucleolin and vimentin did not. Quiescent non-proliferating cells were resistant to cytotoxicity, indicating cytotoxicity may be cell cycle dependent. Although the exact mechanism of cytotoxicity remains unknown, marked potency of the longer (<bold>&#x02a7e;</bold>25&#x02009;nt) ODNs in particular, indicates the potential of these molecules for treatment of diseases associated with abnormal cell proliferation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and in particular certain G-rich ODNs have been widely reported to have effects on cells ranging from the induction of senescence and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) to inhibition of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). In some cases, secondary structure formation of ODNs (e.g. G-quadruplexes) facilitates the recognition by cellular protein(s) thus leading to cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In other cases, anti-proliferative activity of ODNs is related to the ability of the ODN to bind specific cellular proteins independent of secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Known targets of G-rich oligodeoxynucleotides include the human ribosomal protein L7a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), nucleolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), elongation factor 1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>DNAzymes are single-stranded DNA molecules that are able to cleave RNA in a site-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The molecules consist of a 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; binding arm and a catalytically active core region. The stability and activity of the DNAzymes <italic>in vitro</italic> make them a useful tool for gene silencing, and a number of different therapeutic applications have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We recently showed that the cellular effects of some ODNs, originally designed as DNAzymes against the transcription factors <italic>c-jun</italic> and <italic>c-myc</italic>, were not due to the cleavage of the target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Indeed, DNAzymes such as Dz13 (<italic>c-jun</italic>) and Rs6 (<italic>c-myc</italic>) and their catalytically inactive controls were cytotoxic when transfected into several cultured cell lines at concentrations as low as 10&#x02013;50&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). These cytotoxic ODNs all featured G-rich regions at the 5&#x02032; extremity suggesting that this sequence element is required for cytotoxicity. Although this cytotoxicity did not appear to be dependent on the formation of G-quadruplexes and other secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), replacement of any of the three contiguous guanosines of Dz13 with 7-deaza-guanosine abolished cytotoxicity. We therefore postulated that the 5&#x02032; extremity sequence element is necessary for cytotoxicity and may be involved in mediating specific interactions with cellular proteins.</p><p>The aims of the present article were to clarify the sequence elements or &#x02018;motifs&#x02019; required for cytotoxicity, to investigate the activity of various cytotoxic ODNs on different cell types, to determine the culture conditions required for cytotoxicity, and finally, to identify proteins that selectively bind to these cytotoxic molecules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligodeoxynucleotides</title><p>HPLC-purified oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Sigma and Trilink Biotechnologies.

First, a set of oligodeoxynucleotides containing regions of the Dz13 sequence was designed in order to identify any requirement for an active motif. ODNs corresponding to the 5&#x02032; sequence of the first 9 bases of Dz13 (DT1530), this 5&#x02032;sequence plus the 10&#x02013;23 catalytic core (15&#x02009;bp) in the reverse orientation (DT1531) and the 5&#x02032;sequence plus the catalytic core in the correct orientation (DT1532) were tested. All of these were substantially less active than Dz13 (data not shown), suggesting that either length or some other sequence requirement had not been met. Similar results were obtained with the corresponding ODN based on the 5&#x02032; Rs6 sequence (DT1533-5, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; Figure S1a).</p><p>In order to elucidate the requirements of the tail for cytotoxicity, Dz13 analogues of the same length but with modified 3&#x02032; tail sequences were tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These included both CG dinucleotides in the 3&#x02032; tail changed to GC (DT1536), the first 16 bases of Dz13 plus scrambled tail (DT1537), a pool of ODNs all consisting of the first 10 bases of Dz13 followed by a random mix of nucleotides in tail sequence (DT1538) and the first 10 bases of Dz13 followed by a polyA tail (DT1539). The polyA-tailed Dz13 analogue (DT1539) exhibited no cytotoxicity in HMEC-1 cells whereas DT1536 demonstrated intermediate cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Both the scrambled tail analogue (designed to remove the tail hairpin structure) and the mixture of random-tailed oligodeoxynucleotides had activity that was indistinguishable from Dz13, indicating minimal sequence requirements for the 3&#x02032; tail in these 33-mer oligodeoxynucleotides.

None were significantly cytotoxic, although some activity was noted for the 3&#x02032; reverse motif ODN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). This suggests that the motif may also be recognized in the 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction or that part of the activity relates to the rest of the molecule. In any case, this experiment confirmed that the optimal placement for the G-rich sequence of Dz13 is at the 5&#x02032; end.</p><p>Given the lack of activity of the shorter variants (DT1530&#x02013;DT1532), the next experiment sought to clarify the length requirement for the observed cytotoxicity. This was tested by using ODN pools containing the first 10 bases of Dz13 and 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 random bases (DT1544-48, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Cytotoxicity was concentration and length dependent with only the 35-mer ODN pool (DT1548) matching the potency of Dz13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), thus confirming the role of the tail length. A similar result was obtained with DT1572-6, which are based on a slightly different 5&#x02032; sequence (data not shown).</p><p>Given previous results indicating that potency was dependent on a relatively unbiased nucleotide composition of the 3&#x02032; tail, a new 35-mer ODN was tested in which the random tail was composed only of A, C and T bases (DT1552). This ODN was essentially devoid of cytotoxic activity over the concentration range tested (data not shown). These results indicate that the tail sequence has no particular sequence requirements but that potency is dependent on a relatively unbiased nucleotide representation, including some G content.</p><p>A set of 35-mer oligodeoxynucleotides were designed and synthesized in order to identify the minimal 5&#x02032; motif required for activity. This set comprised pools of oligodeoxynucleotides for which the first 10 bases of the Dz13 5&#x02032; G-rich sequence (plus a 25 random base tail; DT1548) was progressively reduced (DT1553&#x02013;DT1554) to the first 4 bases of this sequence plus a 31 base tail (DT1555). Only DT1553 (first 8 + 27 random) and DT1548 (first 10 + 25 random) retained full activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). The corresponding experiment with the Rs6 sequence (DT1557&#x02013;60) produced gradated cytotoxicity profiles with activity increasing with increased retention of the 5&#x02019; Rs6 sequence (Figure S1b).</p><p>The Dz13 5&#x02032; G-rich sequence, when extended with tail sequences of TAG and TAGGAT repeat elements (DT1570 and DT1571, respectively) had reduced activity relative to Dz13 (data not shown). These tail sequences were specifically free of C to prevent the formation of GC clamps and possibly more complex secondary structures.</p><p>As reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), other published G-rich oligodeoxynucleotides are capable of inducing cytotoxicity under the same conditions in HMEC-1 cells including the 20AG ODN described by Cogoi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). We examined whether extension of this sequence in a manner analogous to the Dz13 experiments would influence cytotoxic activity. Consistent with the Dz13 results, 16- (DT1591), 24- (DT1592), 28- (DT1593) and 32-mer (DT1594) variants of the 20-mer 20AG yielded length-dependent cytotoxic activities with the longest two molecules having similar profiles (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Activity of Dz13 in contact-inhibited cells</title><p>Given their potent cytotoxic activity against proliferating cells, Dz13 and the other cytotoxic oligodeoxynucleotides could be of use in several disease states. Dz13 has been reported as being active in several preclinical models of disease including ocular angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), vascular intimal proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), which are all diseases where inappropriate proliferation is present. To investigate any possible differential activity relative to non-proliferating cells, we examined the activity in two additional cell lines that display contact inhibition, namely ARPE-19 and NIH-3T3. In particular, ARPE-19 cells form differentiated, polarized monolayers <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) similar to that present in normal retinal epithelium. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, proliferating ARPE-19 cells were sensitive to Dz13-induced cytotoxicity with an IC<sub>50</sub> between 50 and 100 nM, whereas Dz13scr was inactive. Dz13 cytotoxicity in ARPE-19 cells was abrogated over that concentration range by increasing the cell seeding density to 50 000 cells/well, at which seeding density the cells grew to a uniform dense monolayer. Similar results were obtained for the murine fibroblast 3T3 cells, which are also contact-inhibited and for HMEC-1 cells, which form multilayered sheets at maximal confluence (data not shown). To rule out reduced transfection as the cause for this effect, repeat experiments were scaled up and transfection efficiency was determined using a fluorescent 5&#x02032;-OregonGreen-488 congener of Dz13 (DT1565; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), which was complexed with Fugene6 and transfected at a final concentration of 100 nM. DT1565 had reduced cytotoxicity compared to Dz13 (data not shown), which reduced the confounding effects of toxicity on analysis, and the transfection efficiency as determined by FACS analysis showed higher transfection at the higher cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). These preliminary experiments indicate selective cytotoxicity of Dz13 to proliferating cells as opposed to those that are contact-inhibited and non-proliferating.

In HMEC-1 cytotoxicity assays, these 3&#x02032;-biotinylated ODNs had very similar cytotoxic properties to their untagged counterparts (data not shown). For the pull-down experiments, the biotinylated ODN was coupled to magnetic streptavidin beads and a crossover design employed in which beads coupled to the biotinylated ODN of interest were incubated with HMEC-1 protein, washed with the opposite ODN and eluted with the non-biotinylated bait ODN. That is, when the beads were prepared with the biotinylated congener of Dz13scr and loaded with cell protein extracts, they were subsequently washed with a Dz13 solution and proteins eluted with a Dz13scr solution. For the Dz13-coupled beads, a large number of non-specific proteins were washed off with Dz13scr and a number of strong staining bands were obtained by competitive elution with Dz13, the major one being a &#x0223c;51&#x02009;kDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Elution with the non-cytotoxic Dz13scr yielded a large number of bands including a predominant band at &#x0223c;39&#x02009;kDa, however unlike Dz13, none of these were specifically eluted by Dz13scr.

In these experiments, the number of washes was increased to 30 while the elution volume was kept constant. Following concentration of the eluted fractions, the proteins were digested with trypsin and analysed by LC-MS/MS, with liquid chromatography used to separate the reasonably complex mixture of peptides prior to mass spectrometric analysis. A number of proteins eluting with both Dz13 and Dz13scr were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Proteins identified in the Dz13-eluting fraction (from Dz13-coupled beads) included microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4), nucleolin, vimentin, elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) RNA-binding protein, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and signal recognition particle 14&#x02009;kDa. Proteins identified in the Dz13scr-eluting fraction (from Dz13-coupled beads) included annexin II, GAPDH, heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear proteins A1, Lamin A/C isoform 1 and nucleolin. The 51&#x02009;kDa band was competitively eluted by Dz13 in three independent experiments and eEF1A was identified in these fractions by LC-MS/MS each time. Overall, a total of 10 peptides from this protein were identified that together spanned most of the protein sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Western blotting of pull-down proteins with an antibody directed to eEF1A confirmed that it was the major band identified by silver staining at 51&#x02009;kDa and that the protein bound to both Dz13 and Dz13scr beads but was only eluted by Dz13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The LC-MS/MS identification of vimentin was also confirmed by western blots in which vimentin was shown to bind to Dz-13 coupled beads as well as to Dz13scr-coupled beads (data not shown). Elution of vimentin from the beads with Dz13 or Dz13scr was not detected by western (data not shown). This may reflect the fact that more protein (5-fold) was loaded onto the beads for LC-MS/MS analysis. Vimentin distribution within the various cell compartments was assessed using cell fractionation and western blotting 24&#x02009;h post-transfection with Dz13 and Dz13scr. Vimentin was mostly localized to the cytoskeletal and nuclear fractions and this distribution did not appear to be modified 6 or 24&#x02009;h following transfection with 200 nM Dz13 (data not shown).

DT1501 (rat <italic>c-jun</italic> Dz13 homologue) and Dz13scr are non-cytotoxic to HMEC-1 cells under the conditions used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Cytotoxicity experiments were performed with a GT-rich oligodeoxynucleotide (DT1605; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) previously reported as binding to eEF1A and inducing cytotoxicity in human T-lymphoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, this GT ODN was not cytotoxic to HMEC-1 cells at concentrations of up to 200&#x02009;nM (data not shown). The oligodeoxynucleotides DT1595 (AGGG repeat), Rs6 (DT1556) and NT36 (DT1577; ATM-inducing) all resulted in significant cytotoxicity to HMEC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Elution of eEF1A from Dz13-coupled beads occurred for all the cytotoxic oligodeoxynucleotides tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, elution of eEF1A using non-cytotoxic oligodeoxynucleotides was very poor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Nevertheless, when Dz13 was subsequently used as an eluting solution, eEF1A was strongly released from beads that had been first eluted with the non-cytotoxic oligodeoxynucleotides Dz13scr and DT1501, and to a lesser extent with DT1605. eEF1A was only weakly released by Dz13 from beads where eEF1A had been strongly eluted using the cytotoxic oligodeoxynucleotides DT1595, DT1577 and DT1556 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This demonstrates that eEF1A initially captured by the biotinylated Dz13 beads and only weakly released by the non-cytotoxic ODN could still be released with Dz13 solutions.

Whereas eEF1A from the cytoplasmic, nuclear and membrane/organelle fractions bound to Dz13 beads, the major source of eEF1A eluted by Dz13 was from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Pull-downs were also performed with total protein lysates from a number of other cell lines including RSMC, HEK-293 and HCT-116, to which Dz13 is cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Predominant elution by Dz13 of the 51&#x02009;kDa band was observed in all cases and this band was confirmed as being eEF1A by western blotting (data not shown). The results indicate that eEF1A binding also occurs in other cell lines in which Dz13 is cytotoxic. When examined directly by western blotting, the abundance of eEF1A was not dependent on the cell type and was not affected by treatment with Dz13 for 24&#x02009;h (data not shown).

Nevertheless, in all experiments elution was only partial, and residual eEF1A was found associated with beads post elution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This suggests that the interaction might not be canonical or that eEF1A undergoes a conformational change upon binding that inhibits its release. In addition to <italic>in vitro</italic> binding experiments, cells were transfected with 100 nM biotinylated Dz13 and Dz13scr and pull-downs performed directly on cell extracts. There was binding of eEF1A to both Dz13 and Dz13scr beads (data not shown), confirming the presence of the interaction of both oligodeoxynucleotides when the binding occurs within the cells. Furthermore, despite the high abundance of eEF1A, a possible interaction between Dz13 and eEF1A directly in cells was demonstrated using fluorescence colocalization experiments (Figure S2).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Whilst there are a number of reports describing the cytotoxic nature of certain oligodeoxynucleotides, in particular G-rich oligodeoxynucleotides (see Introduction Section), there is little known about the motif or sequence requirements for cytotoxicity. The current study attempted to define further the exact requirements for cytotoxicity and identify proteins involved in binding to these oligodeoxynucleotides, thereby unravelling the mechanisms involved in the eventual cytotoxicity of the molecules.</p><p>We determined that the 5&#x02032; sequence, the core or the tail of Dz13 alone are insufficient to regenerate the cytotoxic activity of Dz13 against HMEC-1 cells, thereby indicating a length and/or sequence requirement. We used the novel strategy of testing pools of oligodeoxynucleotides comprised of random sequences along with the 5&#x02032; G-rich elements of Dz13 and Rs6 in various position and length contexts to demonstrate that the G-rich element needs to be present at the 5&#x02032; extremity and be followed by a tail component that is preferably composed of mixed nucleotides. A comparison of the active oligodeoxynucleotides, in combination with the 5&#x02032;-motif reduction experiment, leads us to conclude that the required 5&#x02032; sequence is G-rich, composed of 6&#x02013;9&#x02009;nt with at least four consecutive purines. The presence of a triple G motif (G-G-G) provides for the greatest potency and the 5&#x02032; extremity of the triple G motif needs to be positioned no more than 3&#x02009;nt from the 5&#x02032; end of the ODN. We have previously shown by CD that Dz13 does not assemble into stable secondary structures <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Nevertheless, substitution of any of the guanosines in the triple G motif of Dz13 abrogated its cytotoxic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This suggests that the hydrogen bonding activity of these guanosines does not lead to G-quadruplex formation, but is nevertheless required for cytotoxicity, perhaps by enhancing binding of the oligodeoxynucleotides to intracellular proteins. The tail sequence requirements were intriguing in that most sequences with some degree of &#x02018;complexity&#x02019; supported cytotoxic activity, but some individual tail sequences, in particular those free of guanosines, had reduced activity. It is possible that the less complex tail sequences such as the polydA tail are being sequestered by polydA-binding proteins thereby abrogating cytotoxicity. Wu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) have previously demonstrated that tail sequence and complexity encourages the multimeric aggregation of the oligodeoxynucleotides, thereby activating TLR9 and cell uptake. However, we have previously demonstrated a need for transfection and ruled out endosomal TLR engagement in the mechanism of action of Dz13 and Rs6 against HMEC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Therefore, although multimeric assembly remains a possibility, it is unlikely to relate to uptake and TLR engagement.</p><p>We previously compared the activity of Dz13, a prototypic G-rich oligodeoxynucleotide, with that of other published sequences including NT36, an ATM-inducing oligodeoxynucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and 20AG, an oligodeoxynucleotide originally designed to be a triplex-forming inhibitor of K-ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Both of these oligodeoxynucleotides have purine tracts in the 5&#x02032; sequence and NT36 is of comparable length to the active ODNs described in the present study. As shown for Dz13, the potency of the shorter 20AG ODN was length dependent. That is, the cytotoxicity of the AG molecule increased as the length of the molecule increased.</p><p>ODNs have been proposed to exert their cytotoxicity through specific interaction with cellular proteins such as nucleolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and eEF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Nucleolin was identified as one of the proteins that bound to Dz13 and Dz13scr. The absence of an effect on HMEC-1 proliferation by the nucleolin-binding oligodeoxynucleotide GRO29A provided further evidence for the lack of direct involvement of nucleolin in Dz13-mediated cytotoxicity. Likewise, a representative from a class of GT-rich ODNs, which reportedly binds eEF1A and is cytotoxic to human T-lymphoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), was not cytotoxic to HMEC-1 cells. Furthermore in our experiments, the GT oligodeoxynucleotide did not displace eEF1A from Dz13 capture beads as potently as Dz13 or the other cytotoxic ODNs tested, indicating that it has less binding affinity to the eEF1A found in this cell line. The ODNs described in the present study therefore represent a novel class of potently cytotoxic molecules.</p><p>The ability of several of the proteins, including eEF1A to bind competitively to the cytotoxic oligodeoxynucleotides and not be eluted by the non-cytotoxic ODNs <italic>in vitro</italic> suggests that the ODNs may competitively bind to proteins within the cells and that this is mechanistically relevant to the cytotoxicity of the molecule. eEF1A is an extremely abundant protein with a multitude of roles including protein synthesis, stress-sensing, apoptosis and cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Scaggiante <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) recently reported a correlation between eEF1A binding and cytotoxicity of G-rich oligodeoxynucleotides that is independent of secondary structure formation. They also reported that some non-cytotoxic G-rich oligodeoxynucleotides bind eEF1A to a small degree in the absence of competitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The fact that both Dz13 and Dz13scr were able to bind eEF1A <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells indicates that some of the captured eEF1A is also binding via a non-specific mechanism in HMEC-1 cells. However, the selective release of eEF1A from Dz13 capture-beads with those ODNs that are cytotoxic suggests that there is a relationship between eEF1A binding and cytotoxicity.</p><p>eEF1A has been proposed to act as a signalling molecule in proliferating cells through the binding of other nucleic-acid-binding proteins such as ZPR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) followed by translocation to the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus eEF1A has the capacity to bind DNA, RNA and RNA polymerase and therefore potentially plays a role in transcriptional regulation. Binding of eEF1A to Dz13 was observed in nuclear, cytoplasmic, membrane/organelle and cytoskeletal fractions; cytoplasmic eEF1A eluted most strongly from Dz13 beads. This could reflect a greater concentration of DNA-binding proteins in the nuclear fraction and consequently a greater number of proteins eluting in general or that nuclear eEF1A has a higher affinity for Dz13. It is possible that the higher affinity cytotoxic oligodeoxynucleotides displace eEF1A from nuclear or cytoplasmic protein complexes such as the nuclear cytotoxicity-related complex (CRC; 7), thereby inhibiting the normal functioning of eEF1A in the cell, resulting in a reduction in cellular proliferation and eventually cell death.</p><p>Vimentin was also identified in the pull-down assay. Vimentin has been shown to bind to G-rich ODNs, causing the translocation of the vimentin&#x02013;DNA complex to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). However, this was not evident in HMEC-1 cells transfected with Dz13. Collectively the protein pull-down experiments indicate that binding of cytotoxic ODNs to eEF1A and other proteins is potentially a key event in the mechanism of action of the molecules.</p><p>In conclusion, we have determined that ODNs such as Dz13 and Rs6 which were initially designed as catalytic DNAzymes, belong to a group of cytotoxic G-rich ODNs with novel sequence and length requirements. Although the mechanism is unclear, it is likely to be mediated through binding to eEF1A. These molecules are preferentially active against proliferating cells and therefore constitute part of a new class of potentially useful molecules for the treatment or investigation of diseases characterized by abnormal cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p>

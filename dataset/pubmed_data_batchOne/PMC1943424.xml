Turnover rates are also crucial for fluorescence reporters that must strike a balance between sufficient fluorescence for signal detection and temporal resolution for tracking dynamic responses. Here, we use components of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> degradation machinery to construct a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain that allows for tunable degradation of a tagged protein. Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single-cell fluorescence measurements, we monitor protein decay rates after repression using an ssrA-tagged fluorescent reporter. We observe a half-life ranging from 91 to 22 min, depending on the level of activation of the degradation genes. Computational modeling of the underlying set of enzymatic reactions leads to GFP decay curves that are in excellent agreement with the observations, implying that degradation is governed by Michaelis&#x02013;Menten-type interactions. In addition to providing a reporter with tunable dynamic resolution, our findings set the stage for explorations of the effect of protein degradation on gene regulatory and signalling pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>temporal dynamics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A central focus of synthetic biology is constructing isolated gene regulatory networks in living cells in order to determine their dynamical behavior in a given environment. The complexity of naturally occurring gene networks makes this determination difficult, and many investigators have concentrated on smaller artificial &#x02018;circuits' in an attempt to understand fundamental principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hasty <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Sprinzak and Elowitz, 2005</xref>). These smaller networks are more amenable to computational modeling, construction and modification. In addition, the systematic construction of genetic circuits from a set of quantitative design principles will accelerate progress towards therapeutic applications.</p><p>Many cellular functions rely on underlying regulatory processes that are highly dynamic. In the context of interconnected gene regulatory and signalling networks, the persistence of mRNA and protein molecules has a large effect on the overall behavior of the cell. This effect often manifests in the underlying network dynamics, where degradation rates can play a central role in mitigating crucial timing events. Naturally occurring components are often adapted for the construction of artificial gene circuits. These components are usually stable, and this stability constrains the ability to monitor highly dynamic circuits and to construct circuits that possess desired response characteristics. For example, GFP is often used as a reporter in native and artificial synthetic genetic networks, due to its ability to be expressed in various hosts without interfering with cellular function. However, GFP is stable in most cells on a time scale of hours to days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Andersen <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Once stable GFP is expressed, it is cleared from the system only through growth and subsequent dilution, making measurements at higher temporal resolution difficult to interpret. Temporal resolution can be improved by decreasing the half-life of fluorescent proteins. However, such an increase in temporal responsiveness is not without cost, since it reduces detectable signal. Ideally, one could control the stability of a network component, tuning it to balance the needs of signal detection and dynamical resolution.</p><p>There have been several studies that use native protein degradation systems to make network components less persistent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Andersen <italic>et al</italic> (1998)</xref> used the ssrA system in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to target proteins to degradation pathways. In bacteria, polypeptides that stall during translation (e.g., under starvation conditions) have an 11-amino-acid tag added to their C-terminus by a small ssrA molecule. This tag is specifically recognized by the ClpXP proteasome, and tagged proteins are degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Gottesman <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Karzai <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). More recently, it was demonstrated that degradation in <italic>E. coli</italic> could be increased with a modified tag that binds a helper molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">McGinness <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a similar system was described that made translational fusions between a given protein and a domain of <italic>CLN2</italic>, a yeast protein that is degraded quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Mateus and Avery, 2000</xref>). It has also been shown that modification of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> N-degron signal sequence can lead to impressive destabilization of reporters down to a half-life of 2 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Hackett <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). While all of these systems produce more dynamic proteins, none focused on developing tunability over a wide range of degradation rates. In addition, the overexpression of native degradation components in the same organism for the purpose of increasing degradation can have undesired pleiotropic effects.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We have constructed a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain (CGD699) that allows tunable degradation of a tagged protein. To accomplish this, we expressed a modified <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpXP protease in yeast under the control of a repressible promoter. Proteins that are tagged with the ssrA tag are quickly degraded, and this degradation rate is controlled by the induction level of ClpXP. We integrated the two <italic>E. coli</italic> genes (<italic>clpX</italic> and <italic>clpP</italic>) that code for the ClpXP protease into the yeast genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, and Materials and methods). We found that the <italic>clpX</italic> gene needed to be modified with 10 silent mutations to be expressed in yeast (see Materials and methods). These two genes were placed under the control of two separate copies of the modified <italic>ADH1i</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Blake, 2003</xref>), at two different loci in the yeast genome. Additionally, we integrated <italic>mlacI</italic>, a mammalian-enhanced version of <italic>lacI</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cronin <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>), controlled by a wild-type <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter. The wild-type version of the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter exhibits constitutive expression, while the <italic>ADH1i</italic> promoter is repressed by LacI in the absence of IPTG. Addition of IPTG to the medium results in ClpXP production and degradation of a tagged protein. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we also integrated a yEGFP gene tagged with an 11-amino-acid ssrA tag (AANDENYALAA), under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter into CGD699. This promoter is fully induced by 0.5&#x00025; w/v galactose and repressed by 2&#x00025; w/v glucose. CGD699 cells grown in the presence of galactose produce GFP and are fluorescent, and GFP production ceases if the carbon source in the media is switched from galactose to glucose. Observations of growth rate and morphology indicate that the exogenous proteases cause no deleterious cellular effects over a wide range of IPTG levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). While coexpression of tagged yEGFP and the degradation machinery resulted in almost complete loss of fluorescence, coexpression of untagged yEGFP with the degradation machinery showed no significant drop in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). This confirms that the degradation effect is specific to tagged proteins.</p><p>We further investigated the ability of CGD699 cells to degrade tagged yEGFP in response to IPTG induction by microscopy in a microfluidic chamber. Prior to imaging, the cells were grown in log phase for 24&#x02013;36 h in media containing 0.5&#x00025; galactose and the experimental IPTG concentration. These cells were then loaded into a yeast microfluidic chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cookson <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) that was designed to allow temporal switching of inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bennett <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The growth media was switched to media containing IPTG and 2&#x00025; glucose to shut off GFP production from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref> shows a series of bright-field and corresponding fluorescent images for cells exhibiting active degradation in the 1 mM IPTG condition (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Movie</xref>). In cells with <italic>yeGFP-ssrA</italic> but without <italic>clpXP</italic> incorporation, the half-life of GFP was 104&#x000b1;19 min. This half-life is the result of growth-related dilution (note that the doubling time of the batch culture grown on galactose was approximately 125 min; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). The induction of varied expression of the ClpXP protease allows the reduction of the half-life of GFP to as low as 22 min at 5 mM IPTG.</p><p>Previous studies have used exponential fits to characterize the half-life of the reporter. We found that modeling decay as arising from a set of enzymatic Michaelis&#x02013;Menten reactions led to excellent agreement between model and experiment (see below). However, in order to systematically compare with the previous fluorescent reporter degradation studies, we chose to first analyze the fluorescence trajectories with exponential fits that were reasonably accurate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). From these fits, we were able to calculate the mean half-life for each concentration of IPTG, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>. The half-life decreases from a value of 91 min for no IPTG to 22 min for media containing 5 mM IPTG.</p><p>In addition to the exponential fitting, we used the experimental data to determine how the degradation process should be modeled. For this, we assumed that both the <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>ADH1</italic> promoters are constitutive, and that yEGFP-ssrA, ClpXP and mLacI have reached equilibrium before the introduction of glucose. In this case, the transcription of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter stops once glucose has been added and its mRNA begins to decay exponentially from its steady-state value. However, the translation of the mRNA continues, leading to an ODE describing the dynamics of the concentration of yEGFP-ssrA:</p><p><disp-formula id="illus1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb4100168-i1.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>x</italic> is the concentration of yEGFP-ssrA, &#x003b3; is the degradation rate of the <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA, <italic>c</italic> is a constant related to the transcription and translation rates of <italic>GAL1</italic>, &#x003b4; is the dilution rate and <italic>V</italic> and <italic>K</italic> are the Michaelis&#x02013;Menten constants describing the ClpXP-mediated enzymatic decay of yEGFP-ssrA. We assume that glucose is added at <italic>t</italic>=0, so that</p><p><disp-formula id="illus2"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb4100168-i2.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>is the steady-state initial concentration. Because the constant <italic>V</italic> is proportional to the concentration of the enzyme (ClpXP), it will increase with increasing levels of IPTG (which activates ClpXP production). Therefore, increasing the concentration of IPTG will increase the degradation rate of the substrate (yEGFP-ssrA). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref> shows a comparison between single-cell data from three trials (symbols) and time series obtained from a numerical best-fit algorithm of equation 1 (solid lines). The excellent agreement implies that ClpXP-mediated degradation is a Michaelis&#x02013;Menten enzymatic process, as opposed to first-order decay, which is often assumed in models describing signalling or gene-regulatory networks.</p><p>We have adapted the prokaryotic ssrA tagging system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Andersen <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Gottesman <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>) for use in eukaryotic yeast cells. The CGD699 strain allows for the tunable degradation of any protein by adding a short amino-acid tag. In reporter systems, the competing requirements of signal detection and dynamical resolution can be balanced without the need for additional cloning procedures. This system has several advantages over previously described systems. The degradation is tunable over a range of IPTG concentrations. The degradation tag is small and presumably unlikely to interfere with protein function. The small size of the tag simplifies construction of tagged genes by PCR amplification or use of a tagging vector, and many genes can be tagged in parallel. Several variant ssrA tags have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Andersen <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">McGinness <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), allowing another level of control. Induction of ClpXP was non-toxic, as we found no significant change in growth rate or morphology at different IPTG concentrations. In addition, although a yeast homologue to ClpX has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">van Dyck <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), it is located in the mitochondria and acts as a chaperone and not a protease. No homologue to ClpP has been found in yeast. The degradation components are stably integrated into the yeast genome, which allows it to be adapted for use with any number of tagged targets, either integrated or expressed from a plasmid. Due to the simple nature of the system, it might be portable into other genetically tractable eukaryotic models. There is evidence that bacterial ClpX and ClpP can interact with mammalian mitochondrial ClpX and ClpP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kang <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), but the restricted subcellular localization of these mammalian proteins should limit <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction.</p><p>Increased degradation might be achievable by coexpressing the <italic>E. coli sspB</italic> gene, which facilitates ssrA tag binding to the ClpXP protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hersch <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Although we have only used the CGD699 strain with a fluorescent reporter protein, it should be applicable to any protein that can support the short C-terminal ssrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Huh <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). We expect that this system will prove useful for a variety of applications where increased temporal resolution is desired, both as a tool in the construction of small-scale synthetic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hasty <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Sprinzak and Elowitz, 2005</xref>), and in systems biology studies, which seek to unravel network connectivity through perturbation of a given component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Ideker <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Faith <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Growth of microorganisms</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells were grown at 30&#x000b0;C with 300 r.p.m. shaking in SD dropout media containing appropriate amino-acid supplements.

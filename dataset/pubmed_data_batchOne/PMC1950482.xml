The regulatory kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) has emerged as a convergence point for the transduction of these signals into appropriate changes in cell metabolism and growth. TOR activity is stimulated by insulin-responsive phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, by nutrients such as amino acids, and by high cellular energy levels (for reviews see <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sarbassov et al., 2005a</xref>). In response to these signals, TOR effects changes in a diverse number of downstream processes, including transcription, translation, nutrient import, and autophagy, to achieve the alignment of cellular energy utilization with available resources. Unsurprisingly, improper activation of TOR signaling has been implicated in the development of cancers and hamartoma syndromes and in metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Manning, 2004</xref>). For example, mutations in either component of the TSC1&#x02013;TSC2 complex, which is an upstream inhibitor of TOR signaling, result in the formation of benign tumors in multiple tissues.</p><p>Although TOR is known to affect a wide range of cellular processes, the relative contribution of these processes and how they interact to result in a directed growth response remain poorly understood. Components of the translational machinery are well established downstream effectors of TOR signaling (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Hall, 2005</xref>). TOR directly phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor-4E&#x02013;binding protein (4E-BP) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), thereby facilitating cap-dependent translation and ribosome biogenesis. Although these effects on protein synthesis are likely to contribute substantially to cellular growth capacity, they are unlikely to fully account for the growth effects of TOR. For example, whereas inactivation of TOR results in a nearly complete block of protein synthesis in yeast, this effect is more modest in mammalian cells, with an &#x0223c;15&#x02013;50% decrease in translation rate (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jefferies et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Terada et al., 1994</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, null mutations in <italic>4E-BP</italic> are without effect on cell growth (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Junger et al., 2003</xref>), and the growth phenotype of <italic>S6k</italic>-null mutants is significantly less severe than that of <italic>Tor</italic> mutants (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Montagne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Oldham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). Activation of S6K only partially overcomes the growth arrest of <italic>Tor</italic> mutants in this system. Recent genetic studies in mouse have also shown that the ribosomal substrate of S6K, rpS6, does not appear to be a relevant mediator of the growth effects of this pathway (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Pende et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>These observations have motivated the search for other effector pathways and cellular processes downstream of TOR that might contribute to its effects on cell growth. A growing number of studies of TOR structure, function, and localization point to an important role for TOR signaling in controlling vesicular trafficking. Biochemical studies in yeast have found that TOR localizes to intracellular vesicles and cofractionates with endosomal markers (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kunz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Kaiser, 2003</xref>), which is consistent with a role in the endocytic compartment. In addition, TOR has a highly conserved function as a regulator of autophagy, which is a process of cytoplasmic degradation that involves the reorganization of intracellular membranes into autophagic vesicles (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Noda and Ohsumi, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, TOR is structurally related to the class III PI3K/Vps34 family of lipid kinases, with well characterized roles in endocytosis. Interestingly, recent studies have identified a novel role for hVps34 in relaying intracellular nutrient status to TOR (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Byfield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Nobukuni et al., 2005</xref>), indicating that this family of molecules may have common roles in nutrient sensing and membrane trafficking.</p><p>We report the identification of the clathrin-uncoating ATPase Hsc70-4 in a genetic enhancer/suppressor screen for novel TOR interactors in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Hsc70-4 is a critical regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and we provide evidence that TOR signaling influences bulk endocytosis, as well as the targeted endocytic degradation of a specific amino acid transporter. Our results suggest that TOR controls growth, in part, by simultaneously down-regulating aspects of endocytosis that inhibit growth and up-regulating potential growth-promoting functions of endocytosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>
<italic>Hsc70-4</italic> mutants are dominant modifiers of TOR overexpression phenotypes</title><p>To better understand the regulation and downstream effects of TOR-mediated growth signaling, we took a genetic approach to reveal novel players in the TOR signaling pathway. We used a tissue-specific TOR overexpression phenotype as the sensitized background for a dominant-modifier ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis screen. To create this background, <italic>P</italic> element&#x02013;mediated transposition was used to introduce a copy of the wild-type <italic>Tor</italic> cDNA, which was preceded by multiple copies of the <italic>eyeless (ey)</italic> enhancer, into the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome. <italic>ey</italic>-driven overexpression of TOR (<italic>ey</italic>TOR) led to an overall reduction in size of the adult eye (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;B</xref>), demonstrating the paradoxical decrease in growth previously observed to result from wild-type TOR overexpression (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hennig and Neufeld, 2002</xref>). In addition to the reduction in eye size, ommatidial patterning was disorganized, with some ommatidia appearing fused or pitted. Immunohistochemistry of <italic>ey</italic>TOR imaginal discs revealed a delay in morphogenetic furrow progression and missing and disorganized photoreceptor cells, as well as an increased level of cell death (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www/jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511140/DC1">http://www/jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200511140/DC1</ext-link>). The severity of the <italic>ey</italic>TOR phenotype was strongly enhanced by a heterozygous-null mutation of the negative TOR regulator <italic>Tsc1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>) and was suppressed by addition of rapamycin to the media (Fig. S1). These results suggest that the <italic>ey</italic>TOR phenotype results from inappropriately high levels of TOR signaling, and they demonstrate the potential utility of this overexpression phenotype as a dosage-sensitive genetic background.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>

From &#x0223c;60,000 F1 progeny scored, we identified 23 <italic>ey</italic>TOR enhancers and 2 suppressors. Within this collection were two independent groups that failed to complement for lethality. We report the analysis of a third chromosome complementation group consisting of two alleles (<italic>e3</italic> and <italic>e19</italic>) isolated as dominant enhancers of the <italic>ey</italic>TOR phenotype. Heterozygous mutation of either <italic>e3</italic> or <italic>e19</italic> caused a further reduction in eye size of <italic>ey</italic>TOR flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> and Fig. S1) and a similar enhancement of MS1096-Gal4-driven TOR misexpression phenotypes in the adult wing (Fig. S1). Through recombination and deficiency mapping we localized the <italic>e3</italic> and <italic>e19</italic> mutations to the 88E4 genomic region. Complementation tests with lethal mutations in this interval revealed that <italic>e3</italic> and <italic>e19</italic> disrupt the <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> gene, which encodes a constitutively expressed member of the stress-induced Hsp70 family of ATPases. Independently isolated mutant alleles of <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> also displayed a strong enhancement of the <italic>ey</italic>TOR phenotype (Fig. S1). In addition, both the dominant <italic>ey</italic>TOR enhancement and the recessive lethality of <italic>e3</italic> and <italic>e19</italic> could be rescued by a transgene carrying a wild-type copy of <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hing et al., 1999</xref>; Fig. S1). We found that the <italic>e3</italic> and <italic>e19</italic> mutations result in single amino acid substitutions within the ATPase domain of Hsc70-4 (Ser<sub>40</sub> to Phe and Arg<sub>301</sub> to Cys, respectively; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). These residues are completely conserved in fungi, plant, and animal Hsc70-4 orthologues, indicating their likely importance for Hsc70-4 function. Therefore, from this point forth we refer to these mutations as <italic>Hsc70-4<sup>e3</sup></italic> and <italic>-4<sup>e19</sup></italic>.</p><p>Hsc70-4 catalyzes the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, which is an essential late step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Schlossman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, Hsp70 family members can act as chaperones to regulate protein folding and stability (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</xref>). To determine whether either of these functions of Hsc70-4 contributes to its genetic interactions with TOR, we first assayed the ability of other endocytic factors to modify TOR misexpression phenotypes. <italic>Shibire (shi)</italic> encodes the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> homologue of dynamin, which is a GTPase critical for the proper membrane closure and budding of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1991</xref>). We found that expression of a dominant-negative form of shibire, Shi<sup>K44A</sup> (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Moline et al., 1999</xref>), strongly enhanced the <italic>ey</italic>TOR phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>), suggesting that Hsc70-4 may influence TOR signaling through its role in endocytosis. In contrast, <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> mutations did not lead to increased levels of TOR protein in <italic>ey</italic>TOR eye imaginal discs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>), indicating that the enhancement of the <italic>ey</italic>TOR phenotype by <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> mutants is not caused by increased stability or abundance of overexpressed TOR protein. We also observed no increase in total levels of endogenous TOR protein in <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Interestingly, we found that expression of Shi<sup>K44A</sup> led to increased localization of TOR to vesicular structures, a subset of which were accessible to an endocytic tracer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, J&#x02013;L</xref>; see below), further supporting a link between TOR signaling and endocytosis.</p></sec><sec><title>TOR signaling promotes bulk endocytosis</title><p>To further characterize the interplay between TOR and endocytosis, we tested the effect of TOR signaling on several endocytic markers in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larval fat body. The fat body serves as a nutrient storage organ that is analogous to the vertebrate liver (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dean et al., 1985</xref>), and it has recently been shown to act as a nutrient sensor capable of affecting global growth through a TOR-dependent humoral mechanism (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>). We tested the effects of altered nutrient availability and TOR signaling on the intracellular localization of components of the endocytic machinery, using GFP-fusions to Rab5, Rab7, and clathrin. In fat body cells from fed control animals, we observed GFP-Rab5 localization both at the cell surface and throughout the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In contrast, larvae subjected to a 5-h starvation displayed a variable redistribution of GFP-Rab5 toward the cell surface, with a less diffuse, punctate pattern often observed in these cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). More direct alteration of TOR signaling, through overexpression of TSC1 and TSC2, or TOR itself, also affected GFP-Rab5 localization, resulting in the appearance of large aggregates near the cell surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The localization of GFP-Rab7 and clathrin-GFP was also altered in response to TOR inhibition (unpublished data). Overexpression of TOR in fat body cells also resulted in increased expression of Hsc70-4, as monitored by a GFP-Hsc70-4 fusion expressed from the endogenous <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> locus (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Clyne et al., 2003</xref>). Together, these data indicate that altered TOR signaling effects an endocytic response in the fat body.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>

Lsp2 is present in the hemolymph during larval development, and is internalized through endocytosis by the fat body during the late third instar period (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Levenbook, 1985</xref>). Anti-Lsp2 staining revealed a fine punctate appearance throughout the cytoplasm of wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, Shi<sup>K44A</sup>-expressing cells displayed large aggregates of Lsp2 protein at the cell surface and an absence of internal Lsp2 staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> mutant cells were also defective in Lsp2 uptake, and, again, differed from Shi<sup>K44A</sup>-expressing cells in showing a decrease in Lsp2, both internally and at the surface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The effects of TOR signaling on Lsp2 internalization were identical to the effects on TR-avidin; Lsp2 uptake was severely reduced in <italic>Tor</italic> or <italic>S6k</italic> mutant cells and in TSC1&#x02013;TSC2&#x02013;overexpressing cells, and was increased in cells mutant for <italic>Tsc1</italic> or overexpressing Rheb (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C&#x02013;E</xref>, and Fig. S2). Together, these results demonstrate that the Rheb&#x02013;TOR&#x02013;S6K pathway is required for proper endocytic uptake and indicate a novel role for TOR signaling in the positive stimulation of bulk endocytosis.

Activation of TOR through clonal overexpression of Rheb caused an increase in surface levels of Slimfast, which was similar to the effects of Shi<sup>K44A</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). The relative effect of Rheb on Slimfast levels was especially pronounced in larvae subjected to a 24-h starvation (Fig. S3). Under these conditions, TOR activity is reduced in wild-type cells, but maintained in Rheb-overexpressing cells (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Saucedo et al., 2003</xref>). To test whether Slimfast up-regulation is simply caused by increased protein synthesis in Rheb-overexpressing cells, we added the translation inhibitor cycloheximide during the 24-h starvation period. Under these conditions, Rheb overexpression still led to a modest relative increase in Slimfast levels (Fig. S3), which was consistent with a partial posttranslational effect. Reduction in TOR signaling also had a marked effect on Slimfast staining, as overexpression of TSC1&#x02013;TSC2 led to a decrease in Slimfast levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Thus, the localization and levels of Slimfast are sensitive to TOR activity, with high levels of TOR signaling resulting in accumulation of Slimfast near the cell surface, and decreased TOR signaling leading to Slimfast down-regulation.</p><p>We next sought to determine whether TOR signaling might mediate these changes in Slimfast levels through effects on the targeted endocytosis of this importer. We tested whether the Slimfast down-regulation that results from TSC1&#x02013;TSC2 overexpression requires endocytosis by cooverexpressing TSC1&#x02013;TSC2 and Shi<sup>K44A</sup>. In the absence of functional endocytosis, TSC1&#x02013;TSC2 overexpression no longer led to Slimfast down-regulation. Instead, Slimfast protein appeared to be trapped in large aggregates near the surface of these cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Similar results were observed when TOR activity was inhibited through starvation. In well fed larvae, partial disruption of endocytosis through expression of dominant-negative Rab5<sup>S43N</sup> had little effect on Slimfast levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>). In contrast, Rab5<sup>S43N</sup> expression led to a marked persistence of Slimfast at the plasma membrane in starved larvae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 H</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that endocytosis is critical for Slimfast down-regulation in response to reduced TOR signaling, resulting either from poor nutrient conditions or inactivation by the TSC1&#x02013;TSC2 complex.</p><p>To further investigate whether the endocytic down-regulation of Slimfast is a specific, targeted process, we examined the effects of altering components of the endocytic sorting/targeting machinery on Slimfast levels. Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor&#x02013;regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) is an early endosome&#x02013;associated, ubiquitin-binding protein that is critical for proper endocytic sorting. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 I</xref>, homozygous mutation of <italic>Hrs</italic> led to a marked increase in Slimfast levels near the cell surface. Expression of a dominant-negative version of Nedd4, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, similarly caused persistence of Slimfast near the cell periphery (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 J</xref>). Monoubiquitination by the Nedd4 family of enzymes is critical for the initial targeting of plasma membrane&#x02013;localized proteins to clathrin-coated pits for internalization (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rotin et al., 2000</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that components of the endocytic targeting/sorting machinery are critical in mediating Slimfast turnover.</p></sec><sec><title>Endocytosis affects cell growth</title><p>Our observations indicate that TOR signaling affects both bulk and targeted endocytosis. Interestingly, we note that TOR appears to exert opposing effects on these processes, stimulating bulk endocytosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and inhibiting the targeted endocytic degradation of Slimfast (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). To test whether TOR's effects on endocytosis might contribute to its role in promoting cell growth, we assayed the growth properties of cells in which endocytosis was disrupted.

Growth of wild-type <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is delayed on media containing rapamycin, and this delay is sensitive to the dosage of TOR pathway genes (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2003</xref>). We found that heterozygous <italic>Hsc70-4<sup>e3</sup></italic> mutation significantly alleviated the rapamycin-induced delay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 F</xref>), which is consistent with increased levels of TOR signaling. Collectively, the cellular, biochemical, and genetic effects of endocytosis are consistent with this process playing a significant role in cell growth and TOR signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Inactivation of TOR causes an inhibition of cellular growth, a reduction in cell size, and a suppression of cell cycle progression. In addition to well described changes in protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, recent studies have suggested that other cell processes are likely to contribute to these growth effects of TOR. The present study identifies endocytosis as one such process. Our results demonstrate that the clathrin-uncoating ATPase Hsc70-4 interacts genetically with TOR and Tsc1, and that bulk endocytosis is stimulated in cells with activated TOR signaling. Conversely, we find that TOR activity inhibits the endocytic degradation of nutrient transporters such as Slimfast. Together, these endocytic effects of TOR promote both the bulk and targeted uptake of nutrients and other biomolecules required for cell mass increase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In addition to this direct role in cellular biosynthesis and growth, nutrients also act as potent regulators of TOR signaling. Indeed, Slimfast was previously identified as an upstream activator of TOR (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>). Our findings that disruption of endocytosis effects cell size, rapamycin sensitivity, and TOR kinase activity are consistent with an additional role for endocytosis upstream of TOR.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>
<bold>Inverse regulation of bulk endocytosis and targeted endocytic degradation.</bold> (A) Under conditions favorable for growth, TOR promotes bulk endocytic uptake and inhibits the endocytic turnover of specific nutrient importers such as Slimfast. (B) In growth-inhibitory conditions, inactivation of TOR leads to a decrease in bulk endocytosis and an increase in the targeted endocytic degradation of excess nutrient importers. (C) Together, the opposing actions of TOR on bulk and targeted endocytosis serve to facilitate nutrient import, providing energy and building blocks necessary for biosynthetic growth and leading to a further stimulation of TOR signaling.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1730963f07"/></fig><p>Mutations that disrupt endocytosis are likely to have both positive and negative effects on nutrient uptake and cell growth because they inhibit bulk endocytic uptake, as well as degradation of nutrient transporters and other signaling molecules. Thus, the overall effects of endocytic disruption on nutrient uptake, cell growth, and TOR signaling are difficult to predict a priori. Our results suggest that both the cellular context and the specific step at which endocytosis is blocked influence the growth response. Thus, in fat body cells, expression of Shi<sup>K44A</sup> resulted in an increase in cell size, whereas loss of <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> function caused reduced cell size. We note that these changes mirror the effects of these mutations on Slimfast levels; whereas both Shi<sup>K44A</sup> expression and <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> mutation decreased bulk endocytic uptake, only Shi<sup>K44A</sup> resulted in increased levels of Slimfast. In contrast, both Shi<sup>K44A</sup> and <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> mutants led to the increased size of wing imaginal disc cells, suggesting that in these cells the growth-inhibitory effects of endocytic degradation of membrane proteins such as Slimfast predominate over the potential positive effects of increased bulk uptake. Similarly, our results indicate a complex effect of endocytosis on TOR signaling. Partial reduction in <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> levels lead to an increase in TOR signaling, as was evident in the <italic>ey</italic>TOR interaction and rapamycin resistance. In contrast, larvae that are homozygous mutant for <italic>Hsc70-4</italic> show a decrease in TOR kinase activity. These results suggest that modest inhibition of endocytosis may increase TOR signaling, whereas a complete block of endocytosis may reduce it.</p><p>A striking parallel to the inverse regulation of bulk and targeted endocytic processes by TOR can be observed in its effects on autophagy in yeast. Through autophagy, random portions of cytoplasm are nonselectively engulfed within double membrane&#x02013;bound vesicles for delivery to the lysosome. Activation of TOR causes this nonselective form of autophagy to be suppressed, and, instead, the autophagic machinery engages in a selective type of autophagy known as the cytoplasm&#x02013;vacuole targeting (CVT) pathway, which is responsible for lysosomal delivery of specific hydrolases (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Klionsky and Emr, 2000</xref>). Thus, TOR acts as a switch between selective and nonselective autophagy. TOR may also be involved in switching between clathrin-and caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis in higher eukaryotes. A genome-wide survey of protein kinases found that RNAi-mediated inactivation of TOR in HeLa cells inhibited clathrin-dependent processes such as transferrin uptake and vesicular stomatitis virus infection, and stimulated cavelolae/raft-dependent events (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pelkmans et al., 2005</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that TOR may control the specificity of membrane trafficking components. In addition, our results show that S6K, which is an important TOR substrate, acts downstream of TOR in promoting bulk endocytosis, but is not involved in the suppression of starvation-induced autophagy.</p><p>The identification of endocytosis as a TOR-controlled function adds to the growing list of cell processes regulated by TOR, including protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, autophagy, metabolic gene expression, and cytoskeletal organization. How these distinct functions interact to achieve a coordinated growth response is only beginning to be understood. One likely mechanism involves the common use of molecular components and cellular substrates by different cell functions, as in the case of selective and nonselective autophagy, bulk endocytosis, and endocytic degradation. Two or more distinct branches of TOR signaling may also act cooperatively to control the same target, as in the case of Slimfast regulation by both translation and endocytosis, or may act in opposition, as previously observed for the role of S6K in limiting autophagy. Finally, distinct TOR complexes may converge on the same targets with opposing effects, as in the regulation of Akt by TOR-raptor versus TOR&#x02013;rictor complexes (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sarbassov et al., 2005b</xref>). The finding that TOR signaling regulates the levels of Slimfast, which was previously shown to function upstream of TOR, adds another layer of complexity to the TOR signaling network.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>

With the use of mutations that are predicted to disrupt the folding of a zinc finger, we have examined the roles of zinc fingers 1 through 7 of yeast TFIIIA in the establishment of a functional transcription complex both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data indicate that, in addition to their role in DNA binding, the first and seventh zinc fingers contribute other essential roles in the assembly of an active transcription complex. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified residues within zinc finger 1 that are not required for DNA binding but are required for incorporation of TFIIIC into the TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex. Although disruption of zinc finger 2 or 3 had a deleterious effect on the activity of TFIIIA both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we found that increasing the level of their <italic>in vivo</italic> expression allowed these mutant proteins to support cell viability. Disruption of zinc fingers 4, 5 or 6 had minimal effect on the DNA binding and TF activities of TFIIIA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Promoter recognition by RNA polymerase III, which transcribes small non-coding genes such as tRNA genes and 5&#x02009;S RNA genes, is mediated by the transcription factors (TFs) TFIIIA, TFIIIB and TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). These factors assemble in a stepwise manner, beginning with recruitment of the multi-subunit TFIIIC to the promoter of a tRNA gene and the single-subunit TFIIIA to the promoter of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene. The intragenic promoters of these genes, which are referred to as internal control regions (ICRs), are often multipartite, with the sub-elements contributing to the appropriate architecture of the final transcription complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The protein&#x02013;DNA and protein&#x02013;protein interactions that promote assembly of a transcription complex on a tRNA gene have been extensively studied with TFs from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Binding of the six-subunit yeast TFIIIC to the bipartite ICR of a tRNA gene protects the entire gene against cleavage by DNase I. TFIIIC then mediates stable binding of TFIIIB, which consists of three polypeptides including the TATA-binding protein, upstream of the start site of transcription. TFIIIB is responsible for recruitment of RNA polymerase III and is able by itself to direct multiple rounds of accurate transcription. In contrast to the tRNA gene, the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene does not bind TFIIIC directly; rather, the TFIIIA&#x02013;5&#x02009;S DNA complex provides the platform for TFIIIC recruitment. Formation of the TFIIIC&#x02013;TFIIIA&#x02013;5&#x02009;S DNA complex is a prerequisite for the subsequent recruitment of TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III. In this way, TFIIIA acts as an adaptor protein to assemble an initiation complex at the promoter of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene in which the placement of TFIIIC and TFIIIB is similar to that on a tRNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>).</p><p>In most organisms, TFIIIA contains nine sequential Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers that are separated by short linker sequences. However, TFIIIAs with longer spacer regions and additional zinc fingers have been identified in some species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The interaction of TFIIIA from <italic>Xenopus</italic> with the tripartite ICR of the amphibian 5&#x02009;S RNA gene has been studied in detail. The ICR consists of an A box (nt +50 to +64), an intermediate element (nt&#x02009;+67 to +72) and a C box (nt +80 to +97). The results of DNase I protection and chemical protection/interference studies with full-length and truncated polypeptides bound to DNA suggest that the three amino-terminal and the three carboxyl-terminal fingers of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA wind around the major groove, making contacts with the C and A boxes, respectively. Fingers 4, 5 and 6 are proposed to bridge these two domains, with fingers 4 and 6 crossing the minor groove and finger 5 making contacts in the major groove of the intermediate element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18">11&#x02013;18</xref>). Structures of polypeptides containing the amino-terminal 3 or 6 fingers bound to DNA have been determined by X-ray and NMR analyses and support the models derived from biochemical and genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Because a polypeptide consisting of the three amino-terminal zinc fingers of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA was found to bind to the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene with an affinity similar to the full-length protein, this amino-terminal module was initially considered to be the main contributor to the affinity of the protein for DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). However, additional studies with truncated proteins and full-length proteins that contained point mutations, &#x02018;broken&#x02019; fingers and &#x02018;swapped&#x02019; fingers, as well as insights derived from structural analyses, led to the conclusion that the carboxyl-terminal fingers also make a large contribution to the affinity of the protein&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25">22&#x02013;25</xref>). Accommodating the binding of the full-length <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA to DNA has been shown to involve both neighboring finger&#x02013;finger interactions as well as longer range interactions that contribute both favorably and unfavorably to the overall affinity of TFIIIA for the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Once bound to DNA, TFIIIA directs assembly of the TFIIIB&#x02013;TFIIIC&#x02013;TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex. The observation that the association of TFIIIA with DNA is much more stable in a fully assembled complex and in a TFIIIC&#x02013;TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex than in a TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex has led to the suggestion that the rate of assembly of the complete transcription complex is largely independent of the equilibrium binding constant of TFIIIA for DNA as measured in the formation of a binary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). For example, a version of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA that contains a disruption of zinc finger 3 supports wild-type levels of 5&#x02009;S RNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> despite having a 27-fold reduction in its DNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>The carboxyl-terminal portion of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA, beginning at zinc finger 7, appears to have a role in the formation of the initiation complex that is distinct from its role in contacting the A box of the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). A mutation that prevents proper folding of any one of the first six zinc fingers of TFIIIA does not affect either the <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> TF activity of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). A mutation that disrupts the structure of zinc finger 7, 8 or 9 or deletion of a 14-residue sequence in the C-terminal extension of the protein leads to transcriptional defects that cannot be accounted for solely by effects on DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30 B31">28&#x02013;31</xref>). For example, disruption of zinc finger 7 or zinc finger 8 leads to a similar reduction in DNA-binding affinity of TFIIIA. However, disruption of zinc finger 7 leads to only a modest reduction in the activity of TFIIIA whereas disruption of zinc finger 8 abolishes the ability of the protein to support transcription of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene <italic>in vitro</italic> and greatly reduces its activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Like its <italic>Xenopus</italic> counterpart, yeast TFIIIA contains nine Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers. Yeast TFIIIA also contains a unique 81-amino-acid sequence between zinc fingers 8 and 9 that is essential for its TF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The ICR of the yeast 5&#x02009;S RNA gene consists of only a C-box element, located between nucleotides +81 and +94 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). DNase I footprinting and methylation protection studies indicate that the three amino-terminal zinc fingers span the ICR, contacting residues from +79 to +98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Zinc finger 5 contacts residues 73 and 74 of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene, but this interaction does not appear to contribute to the affinity of the protein for the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Although zinc fingers 6 through 9 are not in close contact with DNA in the TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), these fingers are in close proximity to DNA in the fully assembled initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). A truncated version of yeast TFIIIA containing the three amino-terminal zinc fingers interacts with the ICR with high affinity. Although this TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex is able to recruit TFIIIC, the resulting complex is non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The recruitment of TFIIIC appears to require zinc finger 1, as a polypeptide that begins with finger 2 is able to bind to the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene, albeit with reduced affinity, but does not recruit TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). A short leucine-rich segment within the 81-amino-acid region present between zinc fingers 8 and 9 of yeast TFIIIA is also required for the assembly of a functional transcription complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This region might serve as a second docking site for TFIIIC and in combination with zinc fingers 8 and 9, which contribute in a redundant manner to the TF activity of TFIIIA, enforce a topography on the TFIIIC-TFIIIA-5&#x02009;S DNA complex that promotes proper positioning of TFIIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>We have examined the roles of zinc fingers 1 through 7 of yeast TFIIIA in the establishment of a functional transcription complex on the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene. We constructed versions of TFIIIA in which the folding of an individual zinc finger was disrupted by substitution of a zinc-coordinating histidine residue by an asparagine residue. In this study, we compare the ability of these mutant TFIIIAs to bind DNA and to support <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>The construction of pXS-TFC2, which contains the coding region for TFIIIA downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, has been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This plasmid served as the parental plasmid for the introduction of mutations into the coding sequence of TFIIIA. Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved by recombinant PCR using the overlap extension procedure as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) with pXS-TFC2 as the template except as otherwise noted. All PCR amplifications were performed by using the high fidelity Vent DNA polymerase as instructed by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs), and the sequence of all amplified DNA was verified by DNA sequencing.</p><p>A series of pXS-TFC2-derived plasmids was constructed to code for broken-finger versions of TFIIIA containing a histidine-to-asparagine substitution in each of zinc fingers 1 through 7. The upstream and downstream primers used for the construction of pXS-TFC2(H69N), pXS-TFC2(H98N), pXS-TFC2(H126N) and pXS-TFC2(H154N), which encode versions of TFIIIA containing disruptions of zinc fingers 1 to 4, respectively, annealed to the DNA sequence just upstream of the TFIIIA-coding region and to the DNA sequence at the end of the coding region for zinc finger 4. The final PCR product in each case was digested with NcoI and HindIII, and the resulting &#x0223c;510-bp restriction fragments were gel-purified and used to replace the corresponding fragment of pXS-TFC2. The primers used for the construction of pXS-TFC2(H181N), which contains a disruption of zinc finger 5, annealed to the DNA sequence at the beginning of the coding region for zinc finger 4 and to the DNA sequence at the end of the coding region for zinc finger 8. The final PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI, and the resulting &#x0223c;280-bp restriction fragment was gel-purified and used to replace the corresponding fragment of pXS-TFC2. The primers used for the construction of pXS-TFC2(H214N) and pXS-TFC2(H240N), which encode versions of TFIIIA containing disruptions of zinc fingers 6 and 7, annealed to the DNA sequence just upstream of the TFIIIA-coding region and to the DNA sequence at the end of the coding region for zinc finger 8. The final PCR product in both cases was digested with NcoI and XbaI, and the resulting &#x0223c;850-bp restriction fragments were gel-purified and used to replace the corresponding fragment of pXS-TFC2.</p><p>Another series of plasmids encoding versions of TFIIIA with disruption of two zinc fingers was made by combining the appropriate restriction fragments from parental plasmids described above.

The plasmid encoding the version of TFIIIA containing disruptions of zinc fingers 5 and 6 was constructed by replacing the &#x0223c;560-bp NcoI&#x02013;Bsu36I fragment from pXS-TFC2(H214N) (sixth finger disruption) with the corresponding fragment from pXS-TFC2(H181N) (fifth finger disruption).</p><p>Another series of constructs, which was also made by overlap extension PCR with pXS-TFC2 as the template, directed the synthesis of versions of TFIIIA containing the following alanine-scanning mutations of the first finger of TFIIIA: Y49A, F50A, F50E, D52A, Y53A, Y53E, D54A, G55A, D57A, K58A, A59V, F60A, L71A, V73A and the double mutation Y53A/D54A. pXS-TFC2(F50A) was used as the template in the PCR construction of a version of TFIIIA containing the double mutation F50A/Y53A. pXS-TFC2(D54A) was used as the template in the construction of a version of TFIIIA containing the double mutation F50A/D54A, and pXS-TFC2(K58A) was used as the template in the construction of the versions of TFIIIA containing the double mutations F50A/K58A, Y53A/K58A and K58A/L71A.

A previous assessment of the activities of truncated versions of yeast TFIIIA suggested that the first zinc finger contributes to DNA binding and to recruitment of TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Analysis of the effect of substitutions in zinc fingers 8 and 9 that are predicted to disrupt the folding of the finger indicated that these two zinc fingers contribute in a redundant manner to the TF activity of yeast TFIIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). To extend this analysis, we generated a series of plasmids for <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of proteins in which the second zinc-coordinating histidine residue of each of zinc fingers 1 through 7 was replaced by an asparagine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). We refer to this substitution, which is predicted to prevent stable folding of the finger, as a disrupting mutation and to each disrupted finger as zf#<sup>d</sup>, with # identifying the disrupted zinc finger. The substituted residue for disruption of zinc finger 1 through 7 was H69, H98, H126, H154, H181, H214 and H240, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). As a first test of the effect of these mutations on the activity of TFIIIA, we compared the ability of approximately equal amounts of <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized protein (data not shown) to bind to the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene as assessed by an EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Because we have used this assay to give a qualitative assessment of protein&#x02013;DNA interactions and have not determined <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values, we use the term relative affinity in describing our interpretation of the EMSAs. TFIIIA(zf6<sup>d</sup>) was the only mutant protein that retained the ability to bind to the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene with a relative affinity similar to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, compare lanes 2 and 8). TFIIIA with a disruption of zinc finger 1, 4, 5 or 7 appeared severely compromised for DNA-binding activity, with disruption of zinc finger 7 being less deleterious than disruption of zinc finger 1, 4 or 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 3&#x02013;7 and 9). TFIIIA(zf2<sup>d</sup>) and TFIIIA(zf3<sup>d</sup>) had no detectable DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 4 and 5). Despite the qualitative nature of this assay, the data suggest that within the context of the entire protein, only zinc finger 6 of the first 7 fingers can be disrupted without compromising DNA-binding activity. This analysis also revealed the presence of a minor amount of protein&#x02013;DNA complexes of higher mobility than typically observed for the TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex, particularly for reactions containing TFIIIA(zf4<sup>d</sup>) and TFIIIA(zf5<sup>&#x02009;d</sup>). It is possible that these complexes contained a truncated protein generated by proteolytic cleavage within the disrupted finger.

TF activity, which refers to the ability of TFIIIA to assemble a functional transcription complex, was monitored in reactions that contained partially purified TFIIIC, TFIIIB, RNA polymerase III and 5&#x02009;S DNA (see Materials and Methods section). Comparison of TF activity of the mutant TFIIIAs, as measured by the amount of 5&#x02009;S RNA synthesized in <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), with the EMSA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) showed that there was little correlation between the relative ability of a mutant TFIIIA to bind to the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene and to support transcription of the gene. For example, TFIIIA(zf4<sup>d</sup>) and TFIIIA(zf5<sup>d</sup>), which appeared severely compromised in their ability to interact with the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene, were nonetheless able to support near wild-type levels of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D, lanes 6 and 7); similarly, TFIIIA(zf3<sup>d</sup>), which had no detectable DNA-binding activity, was able to support a low level of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D, lane 5). This suggested that in the presence of yeast TFIIIC, TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III, versions of TFIIIA with low affinity for the ICR could nonetheless be captured on DNA to form transcriptionally active complexes. Indeed, previous studies indicated that TFIIIC influences the stability of the TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41 B42 B43 B44">41&#x02013;44</xref>). Detailed studies with <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA led to the conclusion that the activity of TFIIIA in an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reaction is independent of its apparent affinity for 5&#x02009;S DNA as determined in a binary reaction and that TFIIIA molecules can be sequestered in higher order, essentially irreversible transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). It is also possible that the activity of TFIIIA(zf4<sup>d</sup>) and TFIIIA(zf5<sup>d</sup>) increased because potentially proteolytic sensitive sites in these proteins became protected. In contrast, TFIIIA(zf7<sup>d</sup>) did not support transcription of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene despite having a readily detectable DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D, compare lanes 9). TFIIIA(zf1<sup>d</sup>) and TFIIIA(zf2<sup>d</sup>), which had minimal or no DNA-binding activity, respectively, also appeared unable to support <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D, lanes 3 and 4). Finally, TFIIIA(zf6<sup>d</sup>), which had near wild-type DNA-binding activity, supported a high level of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1</xref>C and D, lane 8). In summary, <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized TFIIIAs with a disruption of zinc finger 4, 5 or 6 retained a high level of <italic>in vitro</italic> TF activity whereas TFIIIAs with a disruption of zinc finger 1, 2, 3 or 7 appeared to have defects in TF activity.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding and TF activity of bacterially expressed versions of yeast TFIIIA containing a disruption of zinc finger 1, 2 or 3</title><p>We also expressed wild-type TFIIIA and TFIIIA with a disruption of zinc finger 1, 2 or 3 in bacteria so that we could test the <italic>in vitro</italic> activities of these proteins at higher concentrations than was possible with <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized protein. We found that we could readily detect TFIIIA&#x02013;5&#x02009;S DNA complexes by EMSA with these three mutant TFIIIAs purified from bacteria. Relative to wild-type TFIIIA, however, all three mutant TFIIIAs showed reduced affinity for the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene. The interaction of TFIIIA(zf2<sup>d</sup>) and TFIIIA(zf3<sup>d</sup>) with DNA appeared to be compromised to a greater extent than the interaction of TFIIIA(zf1<sup>d</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E, lanes 3, 5, 7 and 9). We emphasize that we have not carried out quantitative measurements to determine <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values and it is possible that these reactions contained close to saturating amounts of TFIIIA. Of note, however, is that TFIIIA(zf1<sup>d</sup>) was clearly able to bind to the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene. We also monitored the effect of the addition of partially purified TFIIIC to the EMSA reactions. As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), recruitment of TFIIIC to a wild-type TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex generated a complex that had greatly reduced mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E, lane 4). None of the mutant TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complexes appeared, however, to be able to efficiently recruit TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F, lanes 6, 8 and 9).</p><p>We next tested the ability of these bacterially expressed versions of TFIIIA to support <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. TFIIIA(zf1<sup>d</sup>) was unable to support transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F, lane 3) whereas TFIIIA-zf2<sup>d</sup> and TFIIIA-zf3<sup>d</sup> were able to support <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F, lanes 4 and 5).

For this study we used two sets of plasmids: a high-copy &#x00394;pG3-derived series of plasmids in which expression of <italic>TFC2</italic> was directed by the strong, constitutive GPD promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and a low-copy <italic>CEN-ARS</italic> series of plasmids in which expression of <italic>TFC2</italic> was under the control of its own promoter (see Materials and Methods section). Plasmids encoding the mutant proteins were introduced into a &#x00394;<italic>tfc2 ura3</italic> strain that harbored pJA230. This is a low-copy plasmid that contains <italic>TFC2</italic>, which encodes TFIIIA and is an essential gene, and <italic>URA3</italic> as a selectable marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The transformed cells were then tested for their ability to grow on 5-FOA-containing medium; growth on this medium requires that the <italic>URA3</italic>-marked pJA230 plasmid has been lost from cells and is therefore diagnostic of the newly introduced mutant version of <italic>TFC2</italic> being able to support expression of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene. The only essential role of TFIIIA is in directing expression of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p><p>We found that TFIIIA containing a disruption of zinc finger 4, 5 or 6 supported cell growth when expressed at either a low or a high level. TFIIIA containing a disruption of zinc finger 2 or 3 was able to support cell viability, but only when expressed from the high-copy vector. TFIIIA containing a disruption of zinc finger 1 or 7 failed to support cell viability irrespective of expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G, top panel). Our anti-TFIIIA antibody is insufficiently sensitive to detect endogenous TFIIIA or TFIIIA expressed from a low-copy vector in our standard western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G, lane 1). However, TFIIIA expressed from the high-copy vector can be readily detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G, lane 2). We therefore used western blot analysis to test for cellular accumulation of mutant TFIIIAs expressed from the high-copy plasmid in cells prior to growth on 5-FOA-containing medium. These cells were also expressing wild-type TFIIIA from the low-copy plasmid pJA230. We found that all mutant proteins were sufficiently stable to be readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G, bottom panel) and were thus present in cells at a higher level than chromosomally expressed TFIIIA.</p><p>In summary, this analysis indicated that zinc fingers 1 and 7 are essential for the <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly of a functional transcription complex on the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene. The observation that the deleterious effect of disruption of zinc finger 2 or zinc finger 3 could be compensated for by a higher level of <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of the mutant protein was consistent with the observations made in comparing the activities of <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized and bacterially expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C&#x02013;F). Disruption of zinc finger 4, 5 or 6 did not appear to compromise the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of TFIIIA.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of versions of TFIIIA with two disrupted zinc fingers</title><p>Because cells expressing TFIIIA with a disruption in any one of zinc fingers 4, 5 or 6 from a low-copy plasmid were viable, we investigated the possibility that the tertiary structure of this central trimeric unit of fingers might be dispensable. For example, this region of the molecule might serve as a flexible linker to allow appropriate positioning of the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the molecule. We therefore tested the effect of simultaneous disruptions of zinc fingers 4 and 5, 4 and 6, and 5 and 6 on the activity of TFIIIA. For comparison, we also monitored the activity of TFIIIA with simultaneous disruption of zinc fingers 3 and 5, 3 and 6, 3 and 9 and 4 and 9. When these double mutant versions of TFIIIA were synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> and tested for their TF activity, all were found to be defective in the ability to promote 5&#x02009;S RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). However, versions of TFIIIA that combined a disruption of zinc finger 4 with a disruption of zinc finger 5, 6 or 9 supported cell viability when expressed from the high-copy plasmid <italic>in vivo</italic>, although they failed to do so when expressed from the low-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 6&#x02013;8). TFIIIAs that combined a disruption of zinc finger 3, which by itself reduced the activity of TFIIIA such that it could only support cell viability when expressed from a high-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G), with a disruption of zinc finger 5, 6 or 9 were stable, but inactive <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;5). TFIIIA(zf5<sup>d</sup>, zf6<sup>d</sup>) was also unable to support cell viability even when expressed at a high level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 9). In summary, we found that the activity of TFIIIA(zf3<sup>d</sup>) was sufficiently compromised such that it lost all activity on disruption of a second zinc finger. In contrast, the structure of zinc finger 4 appears to be less important for the overall function of TFIIIA, and zinc fingers 5 and 6 may contribute in a redundant manner to an essential function of yeast TFIIIA.

To identify residues in the first zinc finger that might contribute to an interaction with TFIIIC, we mutated amino acids that would be expected to be surface exposed and not directly involved in DNA binding. The solved structures of several zinc finger modules bound to DNA show that such surface-exposed residues are present in the short antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheets and in the &#x003b2;-turn connecting the &#x003b2;-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46 B47 B48 B49">46&#x02013;49</xref>).

A59 was mutated to valine; all other substitutions were to alanine.

As both Y49 and F60 are conserved residues of the zinc-finger motif and contribute to overall folding, the first zinc-finger of TFIIIA(Y49A) and TFIIIA(F60A) may be unable to adopt a stable tertiary structure and this may lead to the apparent defect in recruitment of TFIIIC. In the TFIIIA homologs of <italic>Xenopus laevis, Rana catesbeiana, Homo sapiens</italic> and other vertebrates, the two positions equivalent to F50 and Y53 are represented by isoleucine and phenylalanine, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). This conservation of hydrophobic residues in a region of the molecule that is predicted to be surface exposed is consistent with the notion that this region, and particularly F50 and Y53 of yeast TFIIIA, participates in a protein&#x02013;protein interaction. In a homology model of the first zinc finger of yeast TFIIIA, these residues are indeed surface exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Additionally, we found that reducing the charge in this region, by mutation of D52 or D54 to alanine, did not affect the ability of the TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex to recruit TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 12 and 24).</p><p>We next tested the <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized proteins for their ability to support transcription of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene in the presence of a yeast fraction containing TFIIIC, TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III. All versions of TFIIIA were active in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;4, 6, 7 and 10&#x02013;17). Because both TFIIIA(F50A) and TFIIIA(Y53A) were defective in recruitment of TFIIIC as assessed by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 8 and 14), we next tested the activity of versions of TFIIIA in which these residues were mutated to glutamate, anticipating that the introduction of a charged residue might be more disruptive to the function of the putative hydrophobic interaction interface and thus have a more pronounced effect on the activity of TFIIIA than the alanine substitutions. We also examined the activity of TFIIIA in which the F50A and Y53A substitutions were combined. All three mutants retained the ability to bind to the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene as assessed by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 9, 19 and 21). TFIIIA(F50E) retained the ability to support <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene, but TFIIIA(Y53E) was severely compromised and TFIIIA(F50A/Y53A) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, lanes 5, 8 and 9).</p><p>With the use of the plasmid-shuffling protocol, we found that TFIIIA containing the double mutation F50A/Y53A was the only mutant from the collection of first finger mutants that was unable to support cell viability when expressed at either high or low levels <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lane 9). As assessed by western blot analysis, this mutant protein accumulated to approximately the same level as did wild-type TFIIIA expressed from the high-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E, lanes 2 and 7). TFIIIA(Y53E), which was the only form of TFIIIA other than TFIIIA(F50A/Y53A) that was severely compromised for its ability to support <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, lane 8), was able to support cell viability when expressed from the low-copy plasmid, but not from the high-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, lane 8). This toxic effect of high-level expression of TFIIIA(Y53E) occurred only when cells were challenged to grow on 5-FOA-containing medium. This unusual observation is difficult to explain. It is possible that TFIIIA(Y53E) is modestly unstable and when present at high levels is inactivated by aggregation in a process that does not affect wild-type TFIIIA present in the same cells.

For comparison, we also tested the effect of combining two other mutations, D54A and K58A, with F50A and Y53A; we also combined K58A with the more distant mutation L71A. These five double mutant versions of TFIIIA (F50A/K58A; Y53A/K58A; Y53A/D54A; F50A/D54A; K58A/L71A) retained the ability to bind to the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, odd numbered lanes; TFIIIA shift indicated with open arrowhead).

Whereas specific contacts between zinc fingers and the ICR are a prerequisite for high-affinity, site-specific binding of TFIIIA to DNA, lower-affinity interactions could be important contributors to the overall architecture of the fully assembled transcription complex. Similarly, protein&#x02013;protein interactions, in addition to being required for the recruitment of TFIIIC to the TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex, could also promote conformational changes in the interacting proteins that are essential for the activity of the transcription complex. In this study, we have presented our initial analysis of the roles of individual zinc fingers of yeast TFIIIA in the assembly of an active transcription complex. We have used broken-finger versions of TFIIIA in which the third zinc ligand (i.e. the first of the two zinc-coordinating histidine residues) of a finger motif is mutated to asparagine in the context of the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This mutation is predicted to disrupt the folding of the finger by interfering with its ability to coordinate zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51 B52 B53">51&#x02013;53</xref>) and this would abolish its ability to bind to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Examination of the products of partial proteolysis of broken-finger versions of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA indicates that a finger containing such as histidine-to-asparagine mutation is indeed unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In some cases, however, the fourth zinc-coordinating residue has been shown to be dispensable for folding. The ninth zinc finger of the recently characterized TFIIIA from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, which contains an unprecedented 10 potential zinc fingers, lacks the carboxyl-terminal Zn<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating histidine residue. This module is nonetheless able to fold and function in DNA binding and TF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Based on studies with synthetic, truncated zinc -finger polypeptides that showed that these peptides are able to fold in the absence of a carboxyl-terminal histidine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>), Schulman and Setzer (2003) speculate that a water molecule or a dithiothreitol-provided thiolate acts as the fourth zinc ligand in finger 9 of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> homolog of TFIIIA.</p><p>The effects of disrupting a zinc finger could in part reflect an influence of the mutation on the properties of neighboring zinc fingers. Studies with <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA suggest that disruption of any one zinc finger does not perturb the folding or function of adjacent fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). However, NMR-derived structures of a polypeptide containing the first three zinc fingers of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA bound to its cognate DNA site indicate that substantial packing interactions do occur between these zinc fingers when bound to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Thus, without more rigorous analysis of the properties of the broken-finger versions of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> TFIIIA used in this study, we cannot be certain that the histidine-to-asparagine mutations are effectively and uniquely disrupting the structure and function of the mutated finger.</p><p>In this study, we compared the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> activities of mutant TFIIIAs of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Both these assays showed that zinc fingers 1 and 7 play an essential role in assembly of an active transcription complex. Although our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and current analyses with <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized proteins suggest that the absence of zinc finger 1 leads to a major reduction in affinity of the protein for the ICR, we were able to show with the use of bacterially expressed protein that TFIIIA(zf1<sup>d</sup>) does indeed bind the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene. This finding supported the idea that the essential role of finger 1 is not its contribution to DNA binding, but rather its recruitment of TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Indeed a comparison of bacterially expressed TFIIIA(zf1<sup>d</sup>), TFIIIA(zf2<sup>d</sup>) and TFIIIA(zf3<sup>d</sup>) suggested that TFIIIA(zf1<sup>d</sup>) bound DNA as efficiently as TFIIIA(zf2<sup>d</sup>) and TFIIIA(zf3<sup>d</sup>). The latter two versions of TFIIIA, however, but not TFIIIA(zf1<sup>d</sup>), were able to support <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene and cell viability when expressed from a high-copy plasmid under the control of a strong, constitutive promoter. The observation that TFIIIA(zf2<sup>d</sup>) and TFIIIA(zf3<sup>d</sup>) were unable to support cell viability when expressed from a low-copy plasmid with the <italic>TFC2</italic> gene under the control of its own promoter suggests that the function of TFIIIA that is compromised by disruption of finger 2 or finger 3 can be overcome by increasing the concentration of these proteins in the cell.</p><p>Our EMSA analysis of the bacterial proteins suggested that each of the first three zinc fingers contributed to recruitment of TFIIIC, with the contribution of the first finger being essential. Using an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach, we identified residues within zinc finger 1 that are unlikely to participate in DNA binding but were necessary for the assembly of an active transcription complex. In particular, TFIIIA(F50A/Y53A) bound to the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene, but did not recruit TFIIIC and did not support <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription nor cell viability, even when expressed at a high level. We speculate that the hydrophobic residues F50 and Y53 are surface-exposed, but become masked by an interaction with TFIIIC. Charged residues in this region of TFIIIA appeared less important for this predicted protein&#x02013;protein interaction as the mutations D52A, D54A, D57A and K58A were without effect. Based on the known topography of the multisubunit TFIIIC on the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), the 138-kDa subunit of TFIIIC is a likely candidate for an interaction with the first zinc finger of TFIIIA. Other potential interacting partners are the 91-kDa subunit which has also been positioned at the 3&#x02032;-end of the gene in close proximity to DNA around the transcription terminator, and the 60-kDa subunit, which has not been detected in photocrosslinking studies on either the tRNA gene or the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Although a double mutation within finger 1 was required to completely eliminate the TF activity of TFIIIA, we note that several other mutations that were combined with F50A or Y53A were without effect.</p><p>The transcriptional defect of TFIIIA(H240N), containing a disruption of zinc finger 7, is unlikely to be in its binding affinity to 5&#x02009;S DNA or in the initial recruitment of TFIIIC; <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized TFIIIA(zf7<sup>d</sup>) showed some ability to bind to DNA and the first three zinc fingers of TFIIIA suffice for recruitment of TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). It is possible that a non-specific interaction of zinc finger 7 with DNA is essential for the appropriate positioning of TFIIIA in the fully assembled transcription complex. Site-specific DNA&#x02013;protein photocrosslinking studies show that the interaction of TFIIIA with DNA is more extensive in the fully assembled transcription complex than in the TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Another potential role for zinc finger 7 is in interactions with other TFs. TFIIIC can be recruited to the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene by a TFIIIA that has mutations within the 81-amino-acid region that separates fingers 8 and 9, but the resulting TFIIIA&#x02013;DNA complex is non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). We have previously suggested that the 81-amino-acid region provides a second docking site for TFIIIC and that this is important in adjusting the topography of the complex. Thus, it is possible that the essential function of zinc finger 7 from yeast TFIIIA is in proper presentation of the 81-amino-acid domain for its putative interaction with TFIIIC. However, zinc finger 7 could also be playing a more direct role in the TF activity of the protein. For example, it could interact directly with TFIIIC. Such an interaction would most likely be with the &#x003c4;A domain of TFIIIC, which consists of the 131- the 95- and the 55-kDa subunits. This domain is essential for transcription activation and start-site selection by virtue of its role in positioning TFIIIB upstream of the transcribed region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>).</p><p>We found that both the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> TF activity of yeast TFIIIA was tolerant to disruption of zinc finger 4, 5 or 6. Thus, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), the contacts that are made between zinc finger 5 and guanines +73 and +74 of the 5&#x02009;S RNA gene are not essential. TFIIIA containing disruptions of both zinc fingers 4 and 5, zinc fingers 4 and 6 or zinc fingers 4 and 9 also supported cell viability, albeit only when expressed at high copy. In contrast, TFIIIA with a disruption of zinc fingers 5 and 6 as well as TFIIIAs that combined disruption of zinc finger 3 with disruption of finger 5, 6 or 9 were unable to support cell viability even when expressed at a high level. Although it is possible that some of these deficiencies reflect redundant functions shared between fingers, we consider it more likely that the inactivity of these proteins reflects a cumulative crippling effect.</p><p>In summary, our analysis of the effect of mutations in yeast TFIIIA on its activities <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> have shown that F50 and Y53 of the first zinc finger play a role in recruitment of TFIIIC and have revealed a requirement for the seventh zinc finger in assembly of a functional transcription complex. The fact that neither of these zinc fingers has an essential role in the amphibian TFIIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) is consistent with the high rate of sequence divergence of TFIIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and the observed species specificity in the RNA polymerase III transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Joshua Silver and Adelene Tan for assistance in the construction of several of the plasmids used in this study and Dr David Isenman for assistance with the homology modeling.

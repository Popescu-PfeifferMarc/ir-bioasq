Cell Biol. 25:8643&#x02013;8655). Here, we investigated whether generalized substitution of isoencoding codons affects the duration of expression of PV L1 genes in mouse and human KCs in day 1 culture transiently transfected with native (<italic>Nat</italic>) and codon modified (<italic>Mod</italic>) L1 genes. Following transient transfection, KC continuously transcribed both <italic>Nat</italic> and <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 genes for at least 12 days, with the levels of L1 mRNAs from the <italic>Mod</italic> L1 genes significantly higher than those from the <italic>Nat</italic> L1 genes. However, continuous L1 protein expression at day 9 post-transfection was observed for both mouse and human KCs transfected with the <italic>Nat</italic> L1 genes only. Further, aa-tRNAs prepared from D8 KC cultures enhanced translation of two PV <italic>Nat</italic> L1 DNAs in RRL lysate and PV <italic>Nat</italic> L1 mRNAs in D0 cell-free lysate, whereas aa-tRNAs from D0 KCs enhanced translation of PV <italic>Mod</italic> L1 mRNAs in D8 cell-free lysate.

The 61 sense codons in an mRNA molecular are translated to code 20 amino acids in the course of protein synthesis. Except for methionine and tryptophan, the 18 most common amino acids are coded by two to six codons called synonymous codons. Previous studies have clearly indicated that synonymous codons are used with unequal frequency in a protein-coding sequence and choice of the synonymous codons is far from random both within and between organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Consequently, the patterns of codon usage vary considerably among organisms, and also among genes from the same genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Codon usage has been known to present a potential impediment to high-level gene expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In humans, codon-mediated translational controls may play an important role in the differentiation and regulation of tissue-specific gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Virus genomes frequently have their codon usage significantly different from their host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We observed that papillomaviruses (PVs), like many mammalian DNA viruses, have a significantly greater usage of codons with third position of A/T, manifesting a A+T rich genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Meanwhile, PV late (L1 and L2) genes frequently use the codons such as UUG, CGU, ACA and AUU that are rarely used in mammalian genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, when PV L1 and L2 genes are transfected into a wide range of eukaryotic cells, large amounts of the mRNAs can be transcribed, but no protein product is detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), which indicates that expression of the late genes is subject to post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In HPVs, generalized substitution of isoencoding codons (mammalian preferred codons) with a higher G+C content allows expression of L1 and L2 proteins in different types of eukaryotic cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>). The poor expression of several viral and other proteins has also been attributed to the unfavourable codon usage of their genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18&#x02013;20</xref>). The codon usage of the native GFP gene is not adapted to mammalian &#x02018;consensus&#x02019; and unmodified GFP is poorly expressed in mammalian systems(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Modification of the codon usage of HIV-1 genes to those used by highly expressed human genes has been found to significantly increase HIV-1 structural protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>It is clear now that expression of hetero genes at translational levels can be significantly increased by synonymous codon substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18&#x02013;20</xref>). However, we observed that the effects of synonymous codon substitution on translation of the PV L1 mRNAs in the KC cultures were dependent on the cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In our study, the transiently transfection assay of the PV L1 gene expression in KC cultures was conducted at 48&#x02009;h post-transfection as expression of a targeted gene has been generally overlooked in favour of early time points in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In a recent study, we observed that hm <italic>gfp</italic> variants in which were introduced with different sets of six consecutive codons down stream the AUG codon show different mRNA translation efficiency and have different duration of the GFP expression in transiently GFP plasmids-transfected mammalian cells. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Thus, it is possible that generalized substitution of synonymous codons may improve not only the translation efficiency of the viral genes, but also change the duration of its expression in KCs post-transfection. In this article, we address the following issues: (i) how long expression of the PV L1 genes can be detected in primary mouse and human KC cultures following transient transfection of the <italic>Nat</italic> and <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 gene expression constructs; (ii) whether generalized substitution of isoencoding codons affects the duration of the L1 gene expression due to cell differentiation; (iii) if cell-free lysates prepared from the mouse KC cultures can be used for translation of both <italic>Nat</italic> and <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 mRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> and (iv) whether supplementation of exogenous aa-tRNAs affects expression of <italic>Nat</italic> and <italic>Mod</italic> L1 DNAs and mRNAs in different cell-free <italic>in vitro</italic> translation systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction and preparation</title><p>The four PV L1 gene expression plasmids: pCDNA3 <italic>Nat</italic> HPV6b L1, pCDNA3 <italic>Mod</italic> HPV6b L1, pCDNA3 <italic>Nat</italic> BPV1 L1 and pCDNA3 <italic>Mod</italic> BPV1 L1 used in the experiments have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Briefly, both BPV1 and HPV6b wt L1 ORFs are approximately 1.5&#x02009;kb in length encoding 500 amino acids. The PV wt L1 genes show a strong codon usage bias, amongst degenerately encoded amino acids, toward 18 codons mainly with T at the third position that are otherwise rarely used by mammalian genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). We artificially modified BPV1 and HPV6b L1 genes such that the L1 ORFs were substituted with codons having G or C at the third position, which are preferentially used in the mammalian genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). All of the native and codon modified PV L1 ORFs were sequenced and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA<sub>3</sub>, which contains the simian virus 40 (SV40) ori (Invitrogen, Australia), to give four expression plasmids pCDNA<sub>3</sub>HPV6b <italic>Nat</italic> L1, pCDNA<sub>3</sub>HPV6b <italic>Mod</italic> L1, pCDNA<sub>3</sub>BPV1 <italic>Nat</italic> L1 and pCDNA<sub>3</sub>BPV1 <italic>Mod</italic> L1.

However, a range of strong constitutive promoters including retroviral LTRs, CMV and SV40 have been used to construct many authentic sequence L1 gene expression constructs from different HPV types in various laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). These L1 expression constructs that do not contain the inhibitory elements can easily produce the L1 transcripts when they are transiently or stably transfected to different mammalian cells. But efficient translation of these authentic sequence L1 gene constructs has not been reported. Second, a splicing enhancer or silencer in HPV genome is involved in the expression of the late genes. A splicing enhancer in the E4 coding region of HPV16 is required for inhibition of premature late gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. (2005) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) reported further that an hnRNP A1-dependent splicing silencer in the HPV16 L1 coding region prevents premature expression of the L1 gene. Unfortunately, whether the reported splicing enhancer or silencer can induce protein expression of the late genes has not been reported. Third, blockage to translation of L1 mRNA has been attributed to sequences within the L1 ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Tan <italic>et al</italic>. reported first that most of the sequence of L1 ORF is inhibitory for L1 translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) A major inhibitory element located within the first 129 nucleotides of the L1 gene was then reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Again, expression of L1 and L2 proteins from HPV native L1 and L2 gene expression constructs has not been observed in transiently transfected mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Evidently, the mechanism of the tight control of PV late gene expression is not understood well.</p><p>Recently, by establishing mouse primary KC culture, we were successful, for the first time, to express the L1 proteins of two PV types (HPV6b and BPV1) by transient transfection of authentic or codon modified L1 gene expression plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). KC cultures are heterogeneous, which contain two cell populations: replicating and terminally differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The terminally differentiating KCs that do not divide in culture progressively proceed differentiation and increase their cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Considering the specific characteristics of the KC cultures, we used lipofectamine to transfect the L1 gene plasmid DNAs to the cultured KCs at 80&#x02013;90% confluence instead of 50&#x02013;70% confluence, which is recommended by the manufacturer. We then used flow cytometry analysis to examine the transfection efficiency of the KC cultures transfected with a GFP expression construct and observed that 30&#x02013;40% of the cultured KCs expressed GFP (unpublished data). The L1 gene expression constructs used in our experiments were driven by a strong constitutive CMV promoter. Therefore, it is possible that the levels of expression of L1 mRNA and protein in the present experimental systems would be much higher than those ever achieved during a real infection. It is also clear that the claimed inhibitory elements in the L1 ORFs are not the active inhibitors of translation of L1 mRNAs in our previous and present studies.</p><p>In the present study, we have investigated continuous expression patterns of PV <italic>Nat</italic> and <italic>Mod</italic> L1 genes in cultured mouse and human KCs following a single transfection of the L1 plasmid DNAs. Regarding expression of the PV genes in different mammalian cells, previous studies have reported that synonymous codon substitution can overcome the translation blockage of the viral capsid gene mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and increase levels of E7 protein up to 100-fold due to highly efficient translation of the codon-replaced viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). A deeper understanding of the quantitative relationship between codon usage and protein levels must include studies on the relationship between codon usage and mRNA levels, and subsequently also the relationship between mRNA levels and protein productivity. Previous studies have reported that the mRNAs of <italic>myc</italic> and <italic>fos</italic> genes can be continuously expressed in primary cultured KCs, irrespective of their proliferative or differentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). However, many small vectors with heterologous promoters are prone to vector loss and transcriptional silencing although continuous expression of a transgene at therapeutic levels is required for successful gene therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Only the viral vectors containing U1 snRNA promoters may be an attractive alternative to vectors containing viral promoters for continuous high-level expression of therapeutic genes or proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Therefore, we examined first whether and how mRNAs of the PV L1 genes, whether or not they are codon modified, were continuously transcribed in primary KC cultures over twelve days following a single transfection of the L1 gene expression constructs in D1 mouse and human KC culture. Both the <italic>Nat</italic> and <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 genes cloned into the pCDNA3 vector were driven to express by the CMV promoter, they exhibited continuous mRNA transcription in mouse and human KC culture. But the levels of the <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 mRNAs were significantly higher than those of the <italic>Nat</italic> PV L1 mRNAs in the cultured KCs over the time course investigated, irrespective of their differentiation status, indicating that codon usage can improve transcription efficiency of the viral genes examined in the cultured KCs. The <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 genes were substantially substituted with the codons ending with G or C, exhibiting GC manifest of their mRNA sequences because the <italic>Nat</italic> PV L1 genes have a strong bias of using codons ending with A or T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, from the gene transcription perspectives, the PV L1 genes favour the codons ending with G or C in their gene sequences.</p><p>An interesting observation in the present study is that the expression of the PV L1 proteins from the two <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 genes was scarcely detected at D9 post-transfection. This expression pattern is distinctly different from that of the two <italic>Nat</italic> PV L1 genes, which showed continuously up-regulated expression of the L1 proteins and increased the duration of translation of their mRNAs in both mouse and human KC cultures. It has been reported that genes known to be expressed during latency display codon usage strikingly different from the genes that are expressed during lytic growth in the Epstein-Barr virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). In particular, the percentage of codons ending with G or C is persistently lower (about 20%) in all latent genes than in non-latent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Also, the latent genes have codon usage substantially different from that of host cell genes to minimize deleterious consequences to the host of viral gene expression during latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Thus, the principal explanation to account for the disparity of continuous expression of the L1 proteins from <italic>Nat</italic> and <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 genes in the present study appears to be their synonymous codon usage. The strong A/T codon usage bias of the <italic>Nat</italic> PV L1 genes due to natural selection may be a main determinant for the increased duration of translation of their mRNAs in differentiated KCs.</p><p>Codon usage bias as the main determinant of efficient mRNA translation has been observed in many genes of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). In the present study, we showed that up- and down- regulated translations of either <italic>Nat</italic> or <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 mRNAs in cultured mouse and human KCs were dependent on cell differentiation. Generally, differentiation-dependent translation of genes is determined by interaction of regulatory mRNA sequences with translational regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). Two proteins, hnRNPK and hnRNP E1/E2 from rabbit reticulocytes, mediate translational silencing of cellular and viral mRNAs in a differentiation-dependent way by binding to specific regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Expression of 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) gene is typically regulated by a translational regulatory process. LOX mRNA accumulates early during differentiation, a differentiation control element in its 3&#x02032; untranslated regions confers translational silencing until late stage erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major immediate-early (MIE) genes, encoding IE1 p72 and IE2 p86, are activated by a complex enhancer region that operates in a cell type- and differentiation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Enzymes that are responsible for the translational control of gene expression have also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). A novel mechanism of translational gene regulation by which silenced mRNAs can be translationally activated by the c-Src kinase was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). In HPV, raft cultures treated with activators of protein kinase C can induce post-transcriptional changes in the late gene expression, which may occur through inactivation or down-regulation of splicing factors that inhibit use of the late region polyadenylation site, resulting in increased instability of late region transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). As discussed above, different translational inhibitory mechanisms have been proposed to explain the block to PV L1 and L2 protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). However, neither the &#x02018;block&#x02019; nor the inhibitory element is incomplete as how else would new infections/particles arise. Based on the systematical analysis in the present study, it is evident that the primary determinant mediating differentiation-dependent translation of the PV L1 mRNAs in KCs is the synonymous codon usage of the PV L1 genes, supporting that codon-mediated translational controls may play an important role in the differentiation and regulation of tissue-specific gene products in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>A question arising from the present study is why the gene codon usage can differentially turn translation of the PV L1 genes on and off by a post-transcriptional regulatory process. In the bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic> and in yeast, the use of synonymous codons is strongly biased, comprising both bias between codons recognized by the same transfer RNA (tRNA) and bias between groups of codons recognized by different synonymous tRNAs. Therefore, highly expressed genes use a subset of optimal codons in accordance with their respective major isoacceptor tRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). A model was developed for the co-evolution of codon usage and tRNA abundance explaining why there are unequal abundances of synonymous tRNAs leading to biased usage between groups of codons recognized by them in unicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). Recently, a significant correlation was found between tRNA relative abundances and codon composition of Buchnera genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). Evidently, the match between codon usage and tRNA that mediates translational regulation is a widely used mechanism of translational control. However, in multicellular eukaryotes, there is limited experimental data on tRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>) and its function in regulating gene expression. Although a relationship between tRNA abundance and codon usage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>), no experimental evidence of how codon usage parallels tRNA content to regulate gene translation has been provided. Therefore, it is not clear how tRNA abundance in cells reflects the corresponding codons in mRNAs of the target genes to mediate mRNA translation. Recently, we have reasoned that if the PV L1 protein production by the native L1 genes, which is blocked in less-differentiated epithelial cells, is due to the restricted availability of the appropriate tRNAs, the tRNA pools should be different between proliferative and differentiated KCs. Consequently, tRNA profiles of the differentiated KCs <italic>in vivo</italic>, obtained by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, were distinct from those of undifferentiated cells <italic>in vivo</italic> in mouse and bovine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Meanwhile, aa-tRNAs from differentiated mouse KCs significantly enhanced translation of native PV L1 genes in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In the present study, we observed that the tRNA profile of D0 KCs differs from that of D8-cultured KCs using tRNA gel electrophoresis (unpublished data). Functionally, aa-tRNAs from D8 cultured KCs significantly enhanced translation of the <italic>Nat</italic> PV L1 genes or mRNAs in both RRL and D0 lysate <italic>in vitro</italic> translation systems, but only aa-tRNAs from D0 human KC cultures significantly enhanced translation of the <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 DNAs in RRL <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system and from D0 mouse KC cultures significantly enhanced translation of the <italic>Mod</italic> PV L1 mRNAs in D8 cell-free lysate <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system. Previous studies have shown that tRNAs from uninfected cells can rescue the translation of global proteins in <italic>Autographa californica</italic> nucleopolyhedrovirus-infected Ld652Y cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). Stimulating expression of GTase with tRNA<sup>AGA</sup> and tRNA<sup>AGG</sup> resulted in a 5-fold increase in GTase production in <italic>E. coli</italic> in which codon usage is highly biased and the tRNAs specific to codons AGA<sup>arg</sup> and AGG<sup>arg</sup> are extremely rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). A correlation between tRNA content constraints and gene expression levels has been clearly demonstrated using the concept of optimal codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). Here, the inability to express PV L1 protein from the native L1 gene sequence in undifferentiated KCs and from modified L1 gene sequence in differentiated KCs appears to be due to availability of the cellular tRNAs. Native PV L1 mRNAs may translate in undifferentiated KC lysate in which endogenous mRNAs (host mRNAs) were completely hydrolysed, which may have evolved to exploit the tRNA resources available for their efficient translation in differentiated KCs. The argument is strongly supported by our early work that showed that the problem of translation blockage of PV L1 genes in non-differentiated mammalian cells can be alleviated by gene codon modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) or by cellular tRNA population alteration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was funded in part by the Queensland Cancer Fund (401623 to KNZ) and by a National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia Industry Research Fellowship (301256 to KNZ).

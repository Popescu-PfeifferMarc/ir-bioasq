PrrC comprises a functional C-domain of unknown structure and regulatory ABC/ATPase-like N-domain. The possible involvement of a C-domain sequence in tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> recognition was investigated using a matching end-protected 11-meric peptide. This mimic, termed here LARP (Lys-anticodon recognizing peptide) UV-cross-linked tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> anticodon stem-loop (ASL) analogs and inhibited their PrrC-catalyzed cleavage. Trimming LARP or introducing in it inactivating PrrC missense mutations impaired these activities. LARP appeared to mimic its matching protein sequence in ability to dimerize in parallel, as inferred from the following results. First, tethering Cys to the amino- or carboxy-end of LARP dramatically enhanced the ASL-cross-linking and PrrC-inhibiting activities under suitable redox conditions. Second, Cys-substitutions in a C-domain region containing the sequence corresponding to LARP elicited specific intersubunit cross-links. The parallel dimerization of PrrC's C-domains and expected head-to-tail dimerization of its N-domains further suggest that the NTPase and tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>-binding sites of PrrC arise during distinct assembly stages of its dimer of dimers form.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>PrrC, the optional <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> anticodon nuclease (ACNase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) represents potential antiviral devices widespread among bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). PrrC's activity is silenced by the genetically linked type Ic DNA restriction endonuclease EcoprrI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7">4&#x02013;7</xref>) and is unleashed by Stp, the phage T4-encoded peptide inhibitor of EcoprrI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The activation of PrrC causes specific cleavage of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> 5&#x02032; to the wobble base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and, consequently, could block T4-late translation and contain the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, the T4-coded RNA healing and sealing enzymes 3&#x02032;-phosphatase/5&#x02032;-polynucleotide kinase (Pnk) and RNA ligase 1 (Rnl1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) normally restore the intact form of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), exercising perhaps their intended functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Known PrrC homologs are invariably linked to EcoprrI homologs and, hence, could also act as secondary defenses mobilized when an associated DNA restriction endonuclease is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>When PrrC is expressed by itself it exhibits overt (core) ACNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) that purifies with a homo-oligomeric PrrC form, possibly a dimer of dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). PrrC's N-proximal &#x0223c;265 amino acids are thought to constitute an NTPase domain that mediates the activation of the latent ACNase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>A). This region contains ABC ATPase-like motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), albeit, sufficiently different from the typical to justify classifying PrrC's N-domain as a distinct subtype. The divergent sequence of PrrC's N-domain could account for the unusual nucleotide requirements of the ACNase activation reaction and PrrC's idiosyncratic nucleotide binding attributes. Namely, the activation depends on the cooperation of GTP and dTTP and is inhibited by ATP. Moreover, dTTP exhibits higher affinity for PrrC than GTP or ATP (&#x003bc;M versus mM-range); and dTTP but not GTP or ATP stabilizes PrrC's core ACNase activity. PrrC differs from the typically dimeric ABC ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) also in its apparent dimer of dimers structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The remaining &#x0223c;130 amino acid region of PrrC harbors residues implicated in tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>) and cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and does not resemble a known protein structure. The main cues PrrC recognizes in tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> map to the anticodon stem-loop (ASL). They comprise the anticodon sequence, base modifications and base-pairing interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20">17&#x02013;20</xref>).</p><p>Peptide mimicry and Cys-mediated intersubunit cross-linking data reported here suggest that the tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>-binding motif of PrrC is shared by C-domain portions interfacing in parallel. The proposed parallel dimerization of the C-domains can be reconciled with the expected head-to-tail dimerization of the N-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) by further suggesting that the regulatory and functional sites of PrrC arise at distinct assembly stages of its dimer of dimers form.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Purified <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> labeled with <sup>32</sup>P at the 33p34 junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and synthetic tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> ASL analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) were prepared as previously described.

They were introduced in a LARP derivative containing an extra N-terminal Cys (CLARP, described in more detail later).

The milder Y11S mutation reduced the yield of the primary UV-cross-linking conjugate with ASL-3 nearly 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, lane 3 versus 4) and partially impaired the inhibition of ACNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, lane 3 versus 4). It is noteworthy that this mutation also prevented the formation of a stable secondary conjugate, as inferred from the absence of the expected band <italic>b</italic> and appearance instead of a smear trailing behind band <italic>a</italic>. The more drastic mutation F9S reduced the cross-linking to ASL-3 8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, compare lanes 8 and 9) and severely impaired ACNase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, compare lanes 8 and 9). The corresponding PrrC mutation F292S could also abrogate the UV-cross-linking of PrrC to ASL-3. This was inferred from the observation that the active site PrrC mutant H356A, which lacks ACNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) but efficiently binds tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> (data not shown), formed UV-cross-links to ASL-3 &#x0223c; 30-fold more efficiently than F292S/H356A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C).

It nearly abolished the ACNase-inhibiting potential of CLARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, compare lanes 2, 3 and 5) yet doubled the yield of the primary UV-cross-linking conjugate obtained with ASL-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, compare lanes 3 and 5). In part this increase could be ascribed to the failure of Y11F to form stable higher conjugates, as with Y11S. Nonetheless, the overall cross-linking yield obtained with Y11F suggested that this mutant bound ASL-3&#x02009;at least as efficiently as CLARP. The discrepant behavior of Y11F hinted that the ACNase-inhibiting forms of LARP exerted their effect not only by occluding the RNA substrate but also by forming a binary complex with PrrC. Since LARP was employed in excess over PrrC and ASL-3, it could exert these two ACNase-inhibiting modes independently. The possibility that LARP interacted with PrrC directly was reinforced by data shown below suggesting that both LARP and its matching PrrC sequence can self-interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The failure of the Y11S and Y11F mutants to form stable conjugates containing additional peptide moieties could not be ascribed to a critical role of Tyr<sup>11</sup> in peptide&#x02013;peptide UV-cross-linking since deleting this residue did not elicit such an effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, lane 5).</p></sec><sec><title>Extending LARP with Cys augments its activities under suitable redox conditions</title><p>LARP derivatives extended at the N- or C-end with Cys (CLARP and LARPC, respectively) were intended for further modification with Fe-EDTA that rendered them artificial nucleases (M. Amitsur, D. Klaiman and G. Kaufmann; unpublished data). Unexpectedly, CLARP and, to a lesser extent, LARPC were far more potent than LARP in UV-cross-linking ASL-3 and inhibiting ACNase. Thus, when CLARP, LARPC or LARP were UV-cross-linked to ASL-3&#x02009;at 1&#x02009;mM DTT and identical peptide levels, similar product patterns were obtained. However, the product yields with CLARP or LARPC were about an order of magnitude higher than with LARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Employing the Cys-containing peptides at a level 10-fold lower than that of LARP resulted in comparable yields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). CLARP and LARPC UV-cross-linked ASL-3 more efficiently than LARP also without DTT, LARPC yielding under these conditions a relatively high proportion of the secondary conjugate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). However, the cross-linking efficiency of CLARP and LARPC to ASL-3 was relatively weak at 10&#x02009;mM DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D). CLARP and LARPC inhibited ACNase more strongly than LARP at 1&#x02009;mM DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>E) but were less effective than LARP at 10&#x02009;mM DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>F).</p><p>Thus, tethering Cys to one or the other end of LARP enhanced the ACNase-inhibiting and ASL-3 cross-linking activities of the peptide although not under highly reducing conditions. Moreover, LARPC yielded under oxidizing conditions higher proportions of conjugates likely to contain two peptide moieties per ASL-3. These facts may be accounted for by the stabilization of a common functional form of LARP both by a C-terminal or N-terminal S-S bond, a requirement satisfied by a parallel but not a head-to-tail LARP dimer. An alternative explanation is that mere dimerization of LARP by a disulfide bond at either end increased the probability of non-specific electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions between the peptide and the RNA.</p><p>The tethered Cys residue enhanced the UV-cross-linking efficiency of LARP to ASL-3 optimally at intermediate redox conditions (1&#x02009;mM) rather than oxidizing conditions. This outcome suggested that reversible formation of the disulfide link facilitated the fixation of original LARP&#x02013;LARP and LARP&#x02013;RNA contacts by UV-cross-linking. In other words, a stable S-S bond could impede the UV-cross-linking by constraining the dimer.</p></sec><sec><title>Placing Cys at or near the PrrC region matching LARP triggers intersubunit cross-links</title><p>The suspicion that LARP exerted its ASL-3 cross-linking and ACNase inhibiting activities as a parallel dimer prompted us to examine if the matching PrrC sequence dimerizes similarly. To this end, a Cys residue was introduced in this sequence instead of Ser<sup>288</sup>, Ser<sup>291</sup> or Ser<sup>293</sup>. We expected that the mutant Cys residues will self-interact and form intersubunit disulfide cross-links if the region containing them dimerizes in parallel. Each of the three mutations was placed over the D222E/C268A/C385A background termed PrrC*. This facilitated the isolation of the mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and precluded the formation of non-specific S-S cross-links due to the wild-type Cys residues. The PrrC* control and to-Cys derivatives exhibited comparable <italic>in vivo</italic> ACNase activities and protein levels (data not shown). However, only PrrC* and S288C/PrrC* retained ACNase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A).</p><p>To induce the formation of S-S cross-links the cells expressing the to-Cys mutants or the PrrC* control were exposed to diamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The cellular proteins were separated then by SDS&#x02013;PAGE under non-reducing conditions and PrrC visualized by immunoblotting. As shown, the three mutants, but not PrrC* yielded products that migrated in SDS&#x02013;PAGE slower than the &#x0223c;47.5-kDa PrrC monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). These products included a major form designated X that migrated below the 175-kDa size marker as well as several less pronounced and faster migrating forms. These various products appeared also without diamide, perhaps due to partial <italic>in vitro</italic> oxidation. However, their amounts increased considerably with diamide, consistent with their formation by disulfide cross-linking.</p><p>To determine if any of the diamide-dependent products arose by intra-PrrC cross-links, the four PrrC forms were isolated by immobilized metal affinity chromatography in the absence of a reducing agent. Subsequently they were fractionated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE as such, after prior treatment with 1&#x02009;mM DTT or also with 2&#x02009;mM diamide. Western analysis revealed that the purified Ser &#x02192; Cys mutants, but not PrrC*, yielded a single product with mobility similar to that of band X of the diamide treated cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C, lanes 1, 4, 7 and 10 to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B lanes 4, 8, 12 and 16). Moreover, this band was abolished by DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C. lanes 2, 5, 8 and 11) and restored by excess diamide (lanes 3, 6, 9 and 12), indicating it depended on disulfide cross-linking. Corresponding protein staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>D) ascertained that the various PrrC forms were not contaminated by significant amounts of other proteins and, consequently, that band X was unlikely to contain proteins other than PrrC. The failure of a considerable fraction of the to-Cys mutant proteins to generate band X could be attributed to its misfolding since PrrC is thermally unstable. Alternatively, this fraction could represent a functionally relevant conformation incompatible with the S-S cross-linking; e.g. due to a substrate or inhibitor bound to the tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> site.</p><p>Band X migrated in SDS&#x02013;PAGE less than expected of a cross-linked PrrC dimer of &#x0223c;95&#x02009;kDa. This fact could be attributed to its particular shape or irreversible entanglement of two such dimers within the PrrC tetramer. To distinguish between these possibilities, we subjected PrrC* and S293C/PrrC* to GA-mediated protein&#x02013;protein cross-linking. PrrC* yielded the familiar pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) where the monomer is gradually converted into apparent GA-cross-linked tetramer forms via dimeric and less pronounced trimeric intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>E, lanes 1&#x02013;4). The monomeric fraction of the mutant behaved similarly (lanes 5&#x02013;8). Band X, which coincided with the most retarded GA-cross-linked dimers, was also gradually converted into higher forms superimposed over those generated by the fraction that failed to form the S-S cross-links. These data suggested that band X was a dimer that was retarded due to its particular shape.</p><p>We analyzed in a similar fashion PrrC* derivatives containing Cys in the predicted &#x003b1;-helix found immediately downstream to the LARP-like region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). It replaced L298, I302 or I306 of the &#x003b1;-helix hydrophobic face or the hydrophilic Q300. These mutants also yielded the S-S cross-linked form designated X, L298C yielding the highest proportion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>F, lanes 1&#x02013;3), possibly due to closer contact of the dimerizing &#x003b1;-helices at position 298. Q300C yielded a variant (designated Xb) that migrated slightly faster than the form X generated by the other mutants designated here Xa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>F, compare lanes 3 and 4, 6 and 7). The slight mobility difference may be attributed to the presence of Cys<sup>300</sup> at the hydrophilic and, hence, outward-pointing face of the dimerizing &#x003b1;-helix. Consequently, an S-S cross-link mediated by it could constrain the dimer into a more compact, faster migrating form. The PrrC mutant D222E containing the wild-type residues Cys<sup>268</sup> and Cys<sup>385</sup> failed to generate band X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>F, lanes 16&#x02013;18). This result underscored the specificity of the intersubunit cross-links triggered by the mutant Cys residues placed in the 288&#x02013;306 range.</p></sec><sec><title>Peptide mimicry of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> recognition by PrrC</title><p>LARP formed UV-cross-links to ASL analogs of tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> and inhibited their PrrC-catalyzed cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Moreover, the two activities were impaired by trimming LARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) or placing in it missense mutations that confer a null ACNase phenotype in the PrrC context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Importantly, the CLARP mutation F9S and the corresponding inactivating PrrC mutation F292S severely inhibited the respective UV-cross-linking of ASL-3 to the peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) or protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). These results could be taken to indicate that LARP mimics its matching PrrC sequence in tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> recognition. However, even in that case LARP would probably represent only part of PrrC's tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>-binding motif since the level at which it effectively inhibited ACNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) far exceeds the <italic>Km</italic> of efficient ACNase substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Moreover, known RNA-binding motifs including that of colicin E5-ACNase are several fold longer than LARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> site of PrrC may arise between C-domains interfacing in parallel</title><p>The functional relevance of LARP to its matching PrrC region was suggested also by the apparent ability of both to dimerize in parallel. We deduced that LARP acted as a parallel dimer in forming UV-cross-links to ASL-3 and inhibiting ACNase from the ability of a single Cys residue tethered to either the N- or C-end of LARP to dramatically enhance these activities and abolition of these enhancements under highly reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). These coincidences could be accounted for by the stabilization of a common functional dimeric structure of LARP by a disulfide bond formed at one or the other end of its protomers, a requirement met by a parallel but not anti-parallel dimer. Alternatively, the similar effects of the N- and C-proximal Cys extensions reflected the increased probability of non-specific peptide&#x02013;RNA interactions caused by mere dimerization of the peptide, whether caused by the N- or C-terminal S-S bond. However, we favor the first explanation in view of the intersubunit S-S cross-links triggered by all seven Cys substitutions placed along the C-proximal PrrC 288&#x02013;306aa region overlapping the sequence matching LARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Such an outcome is consistent with parallel dimerization of the mutated region and lends support to the assumption that LARP could also dimerize in this orientation. The PrrC region that dimerizes in parallel could be confined to a portion of the ACNase domain since the regulatory N-domain is expected to dimerize in a head-to-tail fashion, like typical ABC/ATPases where the nucleotide binding pocket arises by the interaction of the Walker A motif of one subunit with the ABC signature motif of the second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Moreover, the wild-type Cys<sup>268 and 385</sup> at the edges of the C-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>A) did not trigger intersubunit cross-links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>F). The relation of the PrrC region that dimerizes in parallel to the tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>-binding motif may be revealed by accurately mapping and functionally characterizing it.</p><p>Finally, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>B, the opposite orientations in which PrrC's N- and C-domains dimerize dictate a phosphofructokinase-like topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) where the NTPase and tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> sites arise at distinct assembly stages of the PrrC dimer of dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Ezra Yagil for comments and Elena Davidov for PrrC mutant proteins.

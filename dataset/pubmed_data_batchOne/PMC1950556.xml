AraR exhibits a chimeric organization: the N-terminal DNA-binding region belongs to the GntR family and the C-terminal effector-binding domain is homologous to the GalR/LacI family. Here, the AraR&#x02013;DNA-binding interactions were characterized <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The effect of residue substitutions in the AraR N-terminal domain and of base-pair exchanges into an AraR&#x02013;DNA-binding operator site were examined by assaying for AraR-mediated regulatory activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and DNA-binding activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. The results showed that residues K4, R45 and Q61, located in or near the winged-helix DNA-binding motif, were the most critical amino acids required for AraR function. In addition, the analysis of the various mutations in an AraR palindromic operator sequence indicated that bases G<sub>9</sub>, A<sub>11</sub> and T<sub>16</sub> are crucial for AraR binding. Moreover, an AraR mutant M34T was isolated that partially suppressed the effect of mutations in the regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-elements. Together, these findings extend the knowledge on the nature of AraR nucleoprotein complexes and provide insight into the mechanism that underlies the mode of action of AraR and its orthologues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The transcription factor AraR controls the utilization of carbohydrates in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. The control exerted by AraR is modulated by the presence of the effector molecule arabinose leading to induction of expression of at least 13 genes, comprising the arabinose (<italic>ara</italic>) regulon, which includes the <italic>araR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). The products of these genes (<italic>araABDLMNPQ-abfA, araE, abnA</italic> and <italic>xsa</italic>) include extracellular and intracellular catabolic enzymes involved in the degradation of arabinose, galactose and xylose containing polysaccharides, uptake of these sugars into the cell and further catabolism of <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and arabinose oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>A key property of AraR is its ability to bind specific DNA sequences in the absence of the inducer <sc>l</sc>-arabinose, as determined by DNAse I footprinting analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). AraR recognizes and binds at least eight palindromic operator sequences, located in the five known arabinose-inducible promoters. Three of these promoters contain two <italic>ara</italic> boxes: the promoter of the <italic>araABDLMNPQ-abfA operon</italic> (boxes OR<sub>A1</sub> and OR<sub>A2</sub>), of <italic>araE</italic> (OR<sub>E1</sub> and OR<sub>E2</sub>) and of <italic>xsa</italic> (OR<sub>X1</sub> and OR<sub>X2</sub>). In the cases of the genes <italic>araR</italic> and <italic>abnA</italic>, a single <italic>ara</italic> box is present (OR<sub>R3</sub> and OR<sub>B1</sub>). AraR binding to the promoters displaying two <italic>ara</italic> boxes is cooperative, requiring in phase and properly spaced operators, and involves the formation of a small loop in the DNA. These two mechanistically diverse modes of action of AraR result in distinct levels of transcriptional regulation, as cooperative binding to two <italic>ara</italic> boxes results in a high level of repression while interaction with a single operator allows a more flexible control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>AraR is a 362 amino acid homodimeric protein that shows a chimeric organization, consisting of two functional domains with different phylogenetic origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>): a small N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) comprising a winged helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix (HTH) motif belonging to the GntR family of transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and a larger C-terminal domain homologous to that of the GalR/LacI family of bacterial regulators and sugar-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). AraR typifies one of the six GntR-subfamilies of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Currently, there are 54 members of this rapidly growing class of proteins, which can be found in prokaryotes [CDART database; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>)].</p><p>Previously, a model for AraR was derived using comparative modelling based on crystal structures of FadR (DBD) and PurR (COOH domain) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). We have used random and site-directed mutagenesis to map the functional domains of AraR required for DNA binding, dimerization and effector binding. The arabinose-binding pocket is composed of polar and charged residues, whereas the dimerization interface has a hydrophobic nature. In both cases, the residues are distributed along the primary sequence of the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Based on crystallographic studies of structurally and functionally related proteins, binding of the effector to the COOH region in AraR is predicted to elicit a conformational change in the N-terminal region, leading to inhibition of binding to operator sequences, and allowing transcription from the arabinose-responsive promoters. This allosteric signal involves a switching mechanism for communicating structural changes triggered in the sensor domain to the regulatory domain, decreasing the affinity of the latter for DNA.</p><p>Winged helix motifs are functionally and mechanistically versatile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). They are primarily involved in DNA binding, but cases have been reported in which they participate in protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Monomeric, homo- or heterodimeric protein&#x02013;DNA complexes have been characterized and revealed quite distinct modes of binding to DNA, which can involve interactions between the recognition helix and the wing with the major and minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Although the level of amino acid identity for the DBD of all members of the GntR superfamily is low (&#x0223c;25%) they share this conserved structural topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Global analysis of the conservation of amino acid sequences in DNA-binding proteins concluded that residues interacting with the DNA backbone establish a set of core contacts that provide stability for homologous protein&#x02013;DNA complexes, and consequently are well conserved across all protein families. On the other hand, residues that interact with DNA bases have more variable levels of conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Previous mutagenic studies showed that AraR residues in the N-terminal region were required for DNA binding because mutations in these residues abolished its regulatory function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, the precise contribution of the mutated amino acids to DNA-binding activity was unclear.</p><p>To understand the specific properties of the interaction AraR-operator sequences, we substituted amino acids, in or near the HTH motif, which according to the model were predicted to contact DNA. We determined the effects of these substitutions on the ability of AraR to function <italic>in vivo</italic> and on the DNA-binding affinities <italic>in vitro</italic>. Conversely, mutational analysis of the AraR-binding sites was used to determine the base-specific requirements for transcriptional regulation <italic>in vivo</italic> and DNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic>. These experiments gave both expected and unexpected results, which together showed that specific AraR residues and operator bases are crucial to achieve a high level of regulatory activity, while others display variable contributions to DNA binding. In addition, an AraR mutant was isolated, which partially suppresses the loss of regulation observed in certain mutated DNA operators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> strains used in this work (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were grown in Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB) medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) or C minimal medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and solid sugar-free agar (SFA) medium (LabM) or LB broth solidified with 1.6% agar.

The construction of plasmid pLS16, carrying the wild-type allele, was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Construction of plasmids carrying the AraR substitutions F37S, Q61R and L33S was accomplished in a similar manner. Briefly, the alleles containing these mutations were amplified with oligos ARA50 and ARA51 from the pLS30-derivatives pIF1, pIF2 and pIF3 obtained previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The 1112-bp PCR product was separately digested with AvaI&#x02013;NdeI and AvaI&#x02013;HindIII, the resulting 282-bp and a 805-bp fragments were inserted in pET30a(+) restricted with NdeI and HindIII, yielding plasmids pIF5, pIF6 and pIF7, respectively. To introduce mutations S53P, H42A or M34T, regions BglII&#x02013;KpnI were obtained from plasmids pIF17, pIF41 and pIF85 described above, and used to substitute the same region in pIF7 generating pIF111, pIF123 and pIF121.

These procedures yielded pIF124, pIF112, pIF78, pIF74 and pIF75, respectively. The presence of the mutations was verified by sequencing the <italic>araR</italic> alleles.

These results were obtained by random and site-directed mutagenesis based on a 3D model of the DBD derived from the crystal structure of the <italic>E. coli</italic> regulator FadR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, many of these mutations resulted in changes that could alter the protein structure or interfere with DNA binding. In order to conduct a more clarifying characterization of the role of specific AraR residues on its DNA-binding activity, we made several amino acid substitutions in or near the HTH motif. Residues were chosen based on the 3D model and/or primary sequence alignment of AraR-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The majority of the substituted amino acids was predicted to contact directly the bases of the DNA and consequently, would account for the specificity of the interaction with operator sequences. Positions K4, E30, R41, H42 and Q61 were exchanged to alanine and Y5 to phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). The substitutions were designed to minimize local structure disruption and probe loss of contact with the DNA. In addition, in this work we analysed a mutation R45L generated by chance during the construction of mutant R45A, which was characterized <italic>in vivo</italic> in a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Plasmid pLS30, carrying an <italic>araR</italic> wild-type allele, and its derivatives harbouring the mutated <italic>araR</italic> alleles, obtained after site-directed mutagenesis, were integrated as single copy at the <italic>amyE</italic> locus of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> receptor strain IQB350. This strain bears an <italic>araR</italic> null mutation (&#x00394;<italic>araR</italic>) and a transcriptional <italic>araAB&#x02032;</italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion (see Materials and Methods section) and therefore expresses constitutively &#x003b2;-galactosidase. In the resulting strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), the levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase expressed from the <italic>ara</italic> operon-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion reflect the <italic>in vivo</italic> regulatory activity of the AraR variant encoded by the allele integrated at the <italic>amyE</italic> locus.

Mutation R41A had no effect on the regulatory activity when compared to the wild type. Therefore, although amino acid R41 is conserved among all members of the GntR family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and establishes interactions with bases in the major groove according to FadR-DNA data [R45 in FadR; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>)], it is dispensable for AraR binding <italic>in vivo</italic>. Variant H42A displayed a minimal decrease on repression activity (1.6-fold). Moderate effects were observed with Y5F and E30A, 3.3- and 4.8-fold, respectively. The more drastic effects were seen with K4A, a 30-fold decrease in repression, and with R45L and Q61A the regulatory activity was completely abolished. The lack of regulation of R45L is identical to that observed with R45A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Together, the results suggest that these three residues play the most important roles in DNA binding of the ones analysed here.

Since these two residues are not conserved among the members of the entire GntR family they may contribute in very different extents to the DNA-binding specificity of AraR-like proteins.</p><p>R45 is a conserved amino acid in the GntR family members. In the regulator FadR from <italic>E. coli</italic>, the substitution of the corresponding residue (R49) has also a drastic effect <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Moreover, the crystal structure of the FadR&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) shows that R49 locates in the recognition helix of the winged HTH and interacts with a phosphate group, not specifically a base. According to the predictions of the tertiary structure of AraR, R45 is also located in the recognition helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), which is generally more responsible for the interaction with DNA, in particular the positively charged residues. Q61 belongs to the predicted wing of the DNA-binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). The corresponding residue in both FadR and in GntR from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is also positively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and substitutions led to loss of DNA-binding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In FadR, H65 is part of the wing and makes specific contacts with an adenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Intermediate decreases of DNA binding were observed with Y5F and E30A, with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> 2.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>&#x02009;M and 2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>&#x02009;M, respectively, similarly to that seen <italic>in vivo</italic>.

These results could be explained by the nature and localization of these substitutions, which suggest implications in the folding of the DBD. Overexpression and purification of L33S yielded only small amounts of protein. Nevertheless, at the maximal concentration that we could use in EMSA assays, 50&#x02009;nM of the mutant, no DNA binding was observed (data not shown).</p><p>Interestingly, while the Q61A substitution completely abolished regulation <italic>in vivo</italic> and DNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, the change to arginine in the same position showed only a 1.6-fold decrease of regulatory activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and the affinity to the DNA probe <italic>in vitro, K</italic><sub>d</sub> 3.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>&#x02009;M, was even slightly higher than that displayed by wild-type AraR.

In addition, oligonucleotides carrying all possible substitutions at the highly conserved base pairs, G<sub>9</sub>, A<sub>10</sub> and T<sub>16</sub> were also used. We compared the ability of these cold DNAs to titrate binding of AraR to the labelled probe, reflected in the decrease of the intensity of the protein&#x02013;DNA complex band. The wild-type OR<sub>A1</sub> box was able to compete for AraR binding in a concentration-dependent manner, with a 79% loss of band shift at 500-fold excess competitor DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). In contrast, a non-specific oligonucleotide (equivalent in length; Supplementary Table 1) used as control disrupted only 18% of the binding (data not shown). Inhibition of binding in the presence of 500&#x02009;nM of the different competitors was quantified and the results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B. The DNA containing mutation T<sub>10</sub>&#x02192;G in OR<sub>A1</sub> competed in levels similar to that obtained for the wild-type box (68 and 79% inhibition, respectively). In contrast, AraR was unable to bind the boxes with single base-pair substitutions in G<sub>9</sub>, either to T (the mutation tested <italic>in vivo</italic>, previously), to A and C (inhibition values between 21 and 16%). A notorious decrease in binding to A<sub>11</sub>&#x02192;C was also observed, which was more pronounced when A was exchanged for G or T. However, oligonucleotides containing a mutation at T<sub>16</sub> (either to G, A or C) were still able to partially compete for the repressor. The three mutations, A<sub>1</sub>&#x02192;C, G<sub>5</sub>&#x02192;T and T<sub>6</sub>&#x02192;G, leading to a partial de-repression <italic>in vivo</italic> also showed an intermediate effect. Taken together, the results indicate a good correlation between the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the exchanges at T<sub>16</sub> and the mutation A<sub>11</sub>&#x02192;C, comparatively to the regulatory activity <italic>in vivo</italic> were expected to bind to AraR less tightly. This could be due to the more reduced sensitivity of the competition assays. Interestingly, the mutation C<sub>8</sub>&#x02192;A, that affected transcription even in the presence of inducer, did not compete (23%) for AraR, indicating that the mutation has an effect on AraR binding that could not be tested <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In previous work, a search for AraR operator sequences in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) identified a putative binding sequence in the open reading frame <italic>ydjK</italic> [identified as a myo-inositol transporter, <italic>iolT</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>)].

To determine the ability of AraR to bind this sequence <italic>in vitro</italic>, competition assays were performed as described above but no competition was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Since T at Position 1 is present in functionally active AraR boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) these observations suggest, in accordance to the mutagenic analysis described above, that G at Position 5 plays an important role in AraR binding.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that bases in both arms of the palindrome of the AraR boxes are involved in AraR&#x02013;DNA contacts. The <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies together with sequence analysis of the eight functionally active AraR <italic>B. subtilis</italic> boxes indicated that bases G<sub>9</sub>, A<sub>11</sub> and T<sub>16</sub> are crucial for AraR binding, and that A<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>6</sub> play also an important role. Furthermore, Position 5 required a purine (Pu) for functionality <italic>in vivo</italic>, and sequence analysis suggested that the corresponding mirror base (Position 12) in the other arm of the palindrome is always a pyrimidine (Py). An alignment of all putative AraR-binding sequences based on a search of the consensus 5&#x02032;-ATTTGTACGTACAAAT-3&#x02032; in genomes of bacteria from the <italic>Bacillus</italic>/<italic>Clostridium</italic> group that contain AraR orthologues also highlighted the majority of the invariable positions: Pu<sub>5</sub>, T<sub>6</sub> and the correspondent mirror A<sub>11</sub>, Py<sub>12</sub> and G<sub>9</sub> at the centre of the palindrome (Supplementary Figure 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation M34T partially restores AraR binding to mutated DNA operators both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>In order to isolate AraR mutants that could suppress the loss of regulation caused by the single nucleotide substitutions in the <italic>ara</italic> boxes, an <italic>in vivo</italic> screening method was developed (see Materials and Methods section). Briefly, random mutagenesis of the 5&#x02032;-end of the <italic>araR</italic> allele was performed by PCR and the resulting library of plasmids carrying the mutated alleles was used to transform <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains, allowing its integration at the non-essential <italic>thrC</italic> locus via a double-crossover event. The receptor strains possessed a &#x00394;<italic>araR</italic> &#x00394;<italic>amyE::OR<sub>A</sub>-lacZ</italic> background, and carried different mutations in the OR<sub>A</sub> operator sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The constitutive expression of <italic>lacZ</italic> due to the inability of the wild-type AraR to bind the mutated operator leads to a Lac<sup>+</sup> phenotype in the absence of inducer. However, if the integrated mutant <italic>araR</italic> allele encodes a protein that suppressed the deleterious effect of the operator mutation a Lac<sup>&#x02212;</sup> phenotype is displayed indicating recovery of regulation. Thus, we screened for transformants with decreased &#x003b2;-galactosidase production in the absence of arabinose.</p><p>One transformant of strain IQB533, containing the fusion <italic>OR<sub>A1(T6&#x02192;G)</sub></italic>&#x02013;<italic>lacZ</italic>, displayed a gain-of-function phenotype, and the sequencing of the <italic>araR</italic> allele revealed the substitution M34T, located in the HTH motif of the protein. To determine if this effect was specific or also affected AraR binding to the other mutated promoters, the allele was integrated at the <italic>thrC</italic> locus of the corresponding <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Interestingly, the repression exerted by mutant M34T was higher than that exerted by wild-type AraR in almost all operators, in particular with mutant boxes G<sub>9</sub>&#x02192;T (both in OR<sub>A1</sub> and OR<sub>A2</sub>), T<sub>6</sub>&#x02192;G, A<sub>11</sub>&#x02192;C and T<sub>16</sub>&#x02192;G. Since a higher level of intracellular accumulation of this AraR variant could explain this phenotype, we determined the accumulation of the wild-type AraR and mutant M34T in strains IQB572 and IQB583, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The observed cellular levels of protein were similar in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), indicating that the phenotype displayed by M34T was not due to increased concentration of protein. In fact, EMSA assays performed as described above showed that the mutant displays an increased affinity to the <italic>ara</italic> operon promoter probe, with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>&#x02009;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C), which is almost 4-fold lower than that of the wild-type protein (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>&#x02009;<italic>=</italic>&#x02009;3.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M). The substitution M34T is located in the first helix of the winged HTH motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). According to a study on protein&#x02013;DNA interactions based on structures of 129 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), threonine is responsible for a far larger number of protein&#x02013;DNA bonds than methionine, although almost all are made with the DNA backbone and not the bases. This is in agreement with the results we obtained, that show an increase in the repression exerted over all mutated boxes, suggesting an increased DNA affinity of M34T through non-specific contacts.

In this work, we focused on two additional and crucial components of the transcription process, the DBD and <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements. Guided by molecular modelling combined with multiple primary sequence alignment of AraR orthologues and GntR family members, we identified amino acids potentially involved in DNA binding. The effect of their substitution was analysed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and revealed key residues necessary for the regulatory activity. In addition, important bases for AraR&#x02013;DNA interactions in both arms of the palindromic operator sequences were also identified. We obtained both expected and unexpected results highlighting the uniqueness of protein&#x02013;DNA interactions in each particular system. A future determination of the structure of AraR, in its unbound form or in complex with the inducer or DNA, would allow a more detailed analysis of the mechanism by which AraR binds its cognate operator sequences and how the conformational change triggered by the binding of arabinose prevents this interaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was partially supported by grants POCTI/BME/36164/00 and POCI/BIA-MIC/61140/04 from Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e Tecnologia (FCT) and FEDER to I.S.-N.

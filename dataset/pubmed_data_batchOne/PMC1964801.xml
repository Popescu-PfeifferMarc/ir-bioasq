In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), only one chromosomal region, the origin of replication has been identified to be <italic>cis</italic>-acting. We constructed a series of mutants with long-range deletions, and the chromosomal regions containing <italic>trans</italic>-acting essential genes were deleted in the presence of plasmids complementing the deleted genes. The deleted regions cover all regions of the chromosome except for the origin and terminus of replication. The terminus affects cell growth, but is not essential. Our results indicate that the origin of DNA replication is the only vital, unique <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA sequence in the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome necessary for survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chromosome deletions</kwd><kwd><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></kwd><kwd>essential genes</kwd><kwd>FLP recombinase</kwd><kwd><italic>red</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The experimental identification of essential genes has been carried out in some bacteria and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Akerley <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Forsyth <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Giaever <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Gerdes <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baba <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Glass <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The methods often used to disrupt genes to determine whether they are essential or not included transposon mutagenesis and targeted disruption by homologous recombination. Using transposon mutagenesis, whole regions of chromosomes can be examined; however, the results are inconclusive, because not all regions are inactivated by random insertion. Targeted disruption, which can identify essential genes expressed in the diploid stage or expressed conditionally, is a suitable method to show whether annotated genes are essential. But intergenic regions have not been investigated. Although most essential <italic>trans</italic>-acting genes have been identified through gene disruption studies, the necessity of the intergenic regions has not been sufficiently clarified. For example, some genetic information in the intergenic regions is transcribed, whereas other genetic information is not. The former sites are <italic>trans</italic>-acting, and the latter sites are <italic>cis</italic>-acting.</p><p>In bacteria, chromosomes are generally uni-replicons; therefore, the origin of replication (<italic>oriC</italic>) is <italic>cis</italic>-acting and essential. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, other <italic>cis</italic>-acting sites have also been reported. The <italic>dif</italic> is a <italic>cis</italic>-acting site, which is important for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Sherratt, 2003</xref>). This site was identified because a mutant with a very large deletion around the replication terminus (<italic>terC</italic>) grew slowly, and the chromosomal region responsible for this growth defect was identified and termed deletion-induced filamentation or <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kuempel <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). This <italic>dif</italic> site was eventually shown to be a site for recombination catalyzed by the XerC-XerD recombinase, which resolves chromosome multimers resulting from homologous recombination between replicated sister chromosomes. Although this site affects cell growth, its deletion leads to a relatively minor growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cui <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Another <italic>cis</italic>-acting site, <italic>migS</italic>, was identified as being responsible for the polar movement of <italic>oriC,</italic> but this site was not essential for cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Yamaichi and Niki, 2004</xref>).</p><p>To understand the essential genetic information of prokaryotic chromosomes, a genomic survey of <italic>cis</italic>-acting essential regions is necessary. An efficient way to identify essential factors, particularly <italic>cis</italic>-acting chromosome regions, is thought to be the systematic construction of large-scale chromosomal deletions. If unique and essential <italic>cis</italic>-acting regions are on a chromosome, the deletion mutants of these regions are no longer viable even in the presence of complementing plasmids. Previously, we constructed long-range deletions of the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome, which led to the reduction of the genome size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hashimoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Kato and Hashimoto (in press)</xref>). First, we constructed 75 deletions (medium-scale deletions (MD)) in regions lacking the essential genes, which were identified through a survey of the published literature, using the <italic>E. coli</italic> homologous recombination system. We then constructed a second series of deletions (large-scale deletions (LD)) and combined them to construct an engineered strain lacking 29.7&#x00025; of the parental chromosome. In this study, we constructed deletion mutants for other chromosomal regions, particularly those containing essential genes, to identify additional essential <italic>cis</italic>-acting chromosome regions, while maintaining the viability of the mutants with complementing plasmids expressing the deleted genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>First, for the chromosomal regions that were not deleted during the construction of the first MD series, the identified essential genes were cloned and the chromosomal regions containing these genes were deleted. We cloned the essential genes into mini-F plasmid vectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>) either <italic>in vitro</italic> using restriction digestion and ligation methods or <italic>in vivo</italic> using the <italic>red</italic> recombination system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table I</xref>). Seven and 34 MDs were obtained in the absence and presence of the complementing plasmids, respectively. We also constructed one new LD. However, we did not succeed in constructing MD and LD deletions for the entire chromosome. Second, we investigated whether or not there were any essential <italic>cis</italic>-acting chromosome regions in the regions not deleted in the MD and LD. Therefore, we developed a system of moving chromosome regions into mini-F plasmids <italic>in vivo</italic> using the yeast FLP-FRT site-specific recombination system 1 (FLP-FRT1) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Kato and Hashimoto, in press</xref>, for details). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows the improved system 2 (FLP-FRT2), which is essentially the same as FLP-FRT1. Using this system, 30 additional chromosome deletions were constructed, indicating that these regions have no essential <italic>cis</italic>-acting chromosome regions. Third, for these regions and the other regions that were not deleted, small-scale deletions (SD) were constructed using lambda (&#x003bb;)-phage and the <italic>red</italic> recombination system (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Kato and Hashimoto, in press</xref>, for details.). Two hundred thirty-eight and 116 small-scale deletions (SD) were obtained using these methods in the absence and presence of complementing plasmids, respectively. Fourth, we tried to construct the deletions again for the other undeleted regions using improved systems. We obtained 5 and 15 deletions with system 2 (FLP-FRT2) and system 3 (FLP-FRT3), respectively. In total, 551 chromosome deletions mutations covering all of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome, except for <italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>terC</italic> were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table I</xref>; see the profiling of <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome (PEC) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/index.jsp">http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/index.jsp</ext-link>) for details).</p><p>The <italic>terC</italic> region does not contain a site that affects cell growth, other than <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kuempel <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>); therefore, the results of this work indicate that there are no unique, <italic>cis</italic>-acting, and essential regions other than <italic>oriC</italic>. Eukaryotic chromosomes are multireplicons, and thus each origin of replication is not necessarily essential. Apart from the origin of replication, other <italic>cis</italic>-acting chromosome regions in eukaryotic cells include telomeric sequences, which are necessary for chromosome maintenance and centromeric regions, which are required for stable segregation of eukaryotic chromosomes. The centromere is a unique region in each chromosome: in theory, two centromeres on one chromosome can pull apart the chromosomal DNA between two daughter cells during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Mann and Davis, 1983</xref>). In prokaryotic cells, the mechanism underlying bacterial chromosome segregation is not understood. So far, a prokaryotic centromere has not been identified and it is not known if one exists. Low-copy number bacterial plasmids have their own partition systems, in which a <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA region plays an essential role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hayes and Barilla, 2006</xref>). But unlike eukaryotic centromeres, a plasmid carrying two copies of the <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence is structurally stable. It is not known whether a eukaryote-like centromere functions in chromosome segregation in prokaryotes. Here, we did not identify any <italic>cis</italic>-acting and essential sites other than <italic>oriC</italic>. Because <italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>dif</italic> regions are not thought to contain a site for chromosome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Kogoma and Meyenburg, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Ogura and Hiraga, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Tecklenburg <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>), our results suggest that a potential <italic>cis</italic>-acting site for chromosome segregation may be dispensable or redundant. Alternatively, prokaryotic cell sequences equivalent to the eukaryotic centromere may not exist. Global reorganization of chromosomes triggered by a loss of this cohesion resembles eukaryotic prometaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Sunako <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bates and Kleckner, 2005</xref>). It is suggested that the bacterial mechanism of chromosome segregation is a primordial one to which microtubule-based processes were added later.</p><p>Our results also show that all of the <italic>trans</italic>-acting essential genes were cloned on the complementing plasmids; however, the cloned genes (501 genes) are not necessarily essential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baba <italic>et al</italic> (2006)</xref> reported 303 <italic>trans</italic>-acting essential genes by targeted disruption, but 35 of them were not cloned on our complementing plasmids, indicating that these genes are nonessential (&#x02018;Class A' in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table II</xref>). The discrepancy between the two studies may be due to a difference in the strains and culture conditions used. For example, the culture media Antibiotic medium 3 (this work) contains a glucose, but LB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baba <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) does not. Alternatively, it may be ascribed to the difference between a single gene knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baba <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and a large-scale deletion of genes (this work). For example, the anti-toxin genes <italic>yefM</italic> and <italic>chpR</italic>, which were identified as essential genes of the toxin-antitoxin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baba <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), were deleted with the toxin genes <italic>yoeB</italic> and <italic>mazF</italic>, respectively, in our study. In addition, the <italic>dicA</italic> gene encoding a repressor of a cell division inhibitor was deleted in our study with the <italic>dicB</italic>, the inhibitor gene, whereas the <italic>dicA</italic> gene disruptant was not obtained in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baba <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, we identified 25 genes (&#x02018;Class B') and 15 genes encoding small RNA (&#x02018;Class C') as essential genes and 2 genes as nonessential genes, which were determined from the results of our gene disruption experiments (J Kato, unpublished data, 2006) and other reports (We listed the relevant PMID number in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table II</xref>). In total, we identified 303 essential genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table II</xref>). Sequence comparison of these essential genes with those of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (271 genes) revealed that 177 were conserved between these two genera (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table II</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). When functionally classified, genes involved in translation, protein translocation, and lipid synthesis were well conserved, whereas those involved in cell wall and membrane synthesis were not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table II</xref>), which may reflect structural differences in the cell wall and membrane.</p><p>In our study, 50 chromosome regions were moved to a mini-F plasmid using the FLP-FRT systems. Forty-six of them were found to contain essential gene(s), whereas 2 regions had no essential genes and were deleted without complementing plasmids. The other two regions (OCL30 and OCL34) did not contain any essential genes, but these regions were essential and therefore were not deleted without the complementing plasmids. In these regions, there may be the functionally redundant genes; one of which may be at least essential. Thirty chromosome regions were first moved to a mini-F plasmid using system 1 (FLP-FRT1). When we tried to move the other 20 regions to the plasmids using the improved system 2, (FLP-FRT2), 5 regions were moved, but the other 15 regions were not. For the regions affected by these deletions, the chromosomes and plasmids of the strains obtained at each step of system 2 (FLP-FRT2) were analyzed. The results indicated that the chromosomal regions flanked by two FRT sites had been excised after induction of the FLP recombinase, but the resultant plasmids were not stably maintained even in the wild-type strain using the mini-F temperature-sensitive replicon. Analyses of some of the excised plasmids suggested a rearrangement of the plasmid structure (data not shown). Unexpected recombination between the cloned chromosomal regions and a mini-F plasmid may cause instability of the excised plasmids. Therefore, we developed an improved system, termed system 3 (FLP-FRT3), in which the excised chromosome region was maintained by an R6K replicon. This finally allowed us to construct the remaining 15 deletion mutations.</p><p>Developments in synthetic biology have made it possible to reduce the size of the genome of <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kolisnychenko <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Yu <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Hashimoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Posfai <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), and recent work indicates that genome reduction can have unanticipated benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Posfai <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). To further engineer <italic>E. coli</italic> and to make useful improvements for industry and therapeutics, such as facilitating the production of metabolites and proteins, it is important to understand both the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting essential genetic information.

id="f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The FRT2 system. A schematic drawing of the transfer of a chromosomal region to a mini-F plasmid with the FRT2 system. The chromosomal region to be deleted is represented by the bold line. The two chromosomal regions (A and B) flanking the region to be deleted are cloned into two kinds of suicide vectors. One is a mini-F plasmid, which has an FRT site and is replication defective at 42&#x000b0;C. The other is a R6K derivative, which has an FRT site and is replication defective due to the absence the <italic>pir</italic> gene necessary for replication. In step 1, the suicide plasmid carrying B is introduced into an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. The chloramphenicol-resistant (Cm<sup>R</sup>) colonies are isolated, representing step 1 recombinants in which the plasmid is integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination. Next, the other suicide plasmid carrying A is introduced into step 1 recombinants, and the ampicillin-resistant (Ap<sup>R</sup>) transformants are obtained at 42&#x000b0;C, representing step 2 recombinants. To inhibit homologous recombination beyond this stage, <italic>recA</italic> is disrupted by P1 transduction. In step 3, the FLP-plasmid, which is replication defective at 35&#x000b0;C, is introduced into step 2 recombinants, and the expression of the FLP recombinase is induced, resulting in simultaneous plasmid excision and chromosome deletion. To obtain a strain that did not carry the FLP-plasmid, cells were incubated at 35&#x000b0;C, at which point the FLP-plasmid does not replicate, but the miniF ts replicon remains functional.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="msb4100174-f1"/></fig><fig id="f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Summary of the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome deletions.

The mRNA harboring amber stop codon at just downstream of initiation site was hybridized with hydrazide-modified ssDNA at upstream of coding region and was ligated to the DNA. This construct was then modified with 4-acetyl-phenylalanyl amber suppressor tRNA. This modified construct was fused with the nascent protein via the phenylalanine derivative when the mRNA uses the amber suppressor tRNA to decode the amber stop codon. The obtained fusion molecule was used successfully in selective enrichment experiments. It will be applicable for high-through-put screening in evolutionary protein engineering. In contrast to fusion molecules generated by other methods in which the protein is linked to genotype molecule through the C- terminus, our fusion molecule will serve to select a protein for which the C-terminus is essential to be active.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>In vitro</italic> selection</kwd><kwd>mRNA-display</kwd><kwd><italic>in vitro</italic> virus</kwd><kwd>C-terminus</kwd><kwd>Non-natural amino acid</kwd><kwd>T4 RNA Ligase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In evolutionary protein engineering, <italic>in vitro</italic> selection using a cell-free translation system carries advantages of large library size and applicability to cytotoxic proteins. Although various <italic>in vitro</italic> protein selection techniques such as <italic>in vitro</italic> virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, mRNA display <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref> and ribosome display <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref> have been developed, most of them are the techniques in which 3'-terminus of the genotype molecule is linked to the decoded peptide via its C-terminus. Thus, they are not adequate to the evolution of the protein, of which C-terminus is essential for its function (such as various peptide ligands, protein-protein interaction domain, membrane proteins, peptide hormones, etc). Therefore, it is worthwhile to devise the method in which the genotype molecule is linked to the decoded protein via its N-terminus, i.e. C-terminus of the protein is displayed freely.</p><p>Also in phage display method, the peptide is fused usually at the N-terminus of coat protein. However, the display method in which the peptide library was fused at the C-terminus of M13 phage major coat protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> and T7 phage D-coat protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> has been also reported. The carboxyl terminal end of PDZ domain-ligands, which is essential to be recognized by PDZ domain, was screened <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> and mapping of the C-terminal epitope of the Alzheimer's disease specific antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref> was carried out using such carboxyl-terminal phage display.</p><p>Several methods that link the protein to its mRNA (or DNA) via N-terminus have been reported. Sawata and Taira reported the binding procedure between MS2 coat protein dimer fused at N-terminus of the protein and the specific recognition sequence in its mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. Yanagawa and coworkers developed the method named &#x0201c;STABLE&#x0201d; in which the streptavidin fused at N-terminus of a peptide was bound to biotin labeled gene DNA in emulsion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. These methods are simple and effective; however, screening condition is limited because its linkage between the peptide and its genotype molecule is non-covalent. Baskerville and Bartel made the ribozyme that catalyzes a phosphoamide bond formation between the 5'-terminus of the encoding RNA and the N-terminus of the decoded polypeptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. Nester and coworkers developed the method that employed the property of VirD2 protein, which covalently binds to the specific DNA sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>. These methods employ a covalent bond to linkage the peptide and its genotype molecule; however, these have not been applied yet to <italic>in vitro</italic> selection.</p><p>To date, many studies on the non-natural amino acid incorporation into a protein using nonsense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> or frame-shift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref> suppression have been reported. And recently, these have been applied to <italic>in vitro</italic> protein display methods to introduce the mRNA-peptide fusion molecule library containing non-natural amino acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>.</p><p>In this article we report the novel method to link the N-terminus of the peptide to its mRNA. In our method, the mRNA is linked via ssDNA and spacer to phenylalanine derivative, which is acylated to amber sup tRNA. When this modified mRNA is subjected to a cell-free translation system, this phenylalanine derivative would be incorporated into the N-terminus region of the nascent peptide at the amber stop codon inserted at the beginning of the encoded region. Consequently, C-terminus of the peptide is displayed on its mRNA (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Synthesis of the DNA-linker having a hydrazide group</title><p>The DNA-linker having a hydrazide group at 5'-terminus (hydrazide-linker) was synthesized as follows. 5'-NH<sub>2</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>-(dA)<sub>30</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>-GGG-(dT-FITC)-CGGGGGGCAAAA-3', where (dA)<sub>30</sub> is 30 nucleotides of deoxy adenosine, (dT-FITC) is fluorescein-modified deoxy thymidine, was purchased from Tsukuba Oligo Service Co., Ltd (Ibaraki, Japan). Single riboadenosine was added to 3'-terminus of the oligomer (1.0 nmol) using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (24 U, Takara Bio) with 20 &#x000b5;mol ATP at 37 &#x000b0;C for overnight in 50 &#x000b5;l of supplied TdT buffer. The product was purified on P6 column (Bio Rad) to remove excess ATP, followed by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The precipitate was dissolved in 65 &#x000b5;l of 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 9.0) and then mixed with 10 &#x000b5;l of 0.025 M succinic anhydride in DMSO for overnight at room temperature and purified on P6 column (Bio Rad) pre-equilibrated with H<sub>2</sub>O. Purified sample was mixed with 2 mg adipodihydrazide and 5 mg EDC (1-ethyl-3- (3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide) in 70 &#x000b5;l of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 4 hour at room temperature and purified on P6 column pre-equilibrated with H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>The length of the DNA-linker used in this study was designed as follow. The local maximum concentration of two sites on a linear ssRNA chain (polyU) is described as:</p><disp-formula id="E1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="ijbsv03p0365g02.jpg" mimetype="image"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula><p>where &#x003bd; is the distance-through-bond in nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>.</p><p>Probability distribution of local concentration j<sub>&#x003bd;</sub> (r) is described as :</p><disp-formula id="E2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="ijbsv03p0365g03.jpg" mimetype="image"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula><p>where r is the distance-through-space between the two sites, n is the distance-through-bond in the number of Kuhn segment and l is statistical segment length or Kuhn length. For ssRNA, the number of Kuhn segment and Kuhn length were reported for polyU as &#x003bd;/6 and 4 nm, respectively.</p><p>The value of r for our case is 14 nm that is the distance-through-space between the exit position of mRNA on ribosome and the entrance of A-site of ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. On the assumption that mRNA and the linker were composed of ssRNA, the probability distribution of local concentration of linked aminoacyl sup tRNA on the entrance of A-site of ribosome is given as:</p><disp-formula id="E3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="ijbsv03p0365g04.jpg" mimetype="image"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula><p>According to Equation 3, the maximum local concentration 45.5 &#x000b5;M is obtained when the distance-through-bond &#x003bd; is 75 nt. Thus, the linker length was designed so that the chain length from the mRNA exit site to the 5'-terminus of the linker become equivalent to 75 nt.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of the mRNA-templates</title><p>The His-tag encoding DNA (178 bp, Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A) was constructed by three steps of PCR amplification.

Results and Discussions</title><sec><title>Ligation between the mRNA and the hydrazide-linker</title><p>The connecting efficiency between the mRNA and the linker-molecule affects the diversity of the library. Thus, various sophisticated procedures have been devised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. In this report, we applied the Y-ligation method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, which is the method of two single-strands ligation in the presence of a double-stranded stem to make a stem-loop structure in high efficiency. Because the transcripts were used as a phosphate donor substrate and the DNA moiety of hydrazide-linker were used as an acceptor substrate for T4 RNA ligase (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B), several modifications were required. First, transcription must be performed with excessive AMP (for T7&#x003c6;2.5 promoter, GMP for normal T7 promoter and SP6 promoter) to generate the monophosphate at the 5'-terminus of the transcript and a riboadenosine must be attached to the 3'-terminus of the DNA moiety of hydrazide-linker by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase to be recognized by T4 RNA ligase (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. Unless these modifications were performed, the ligated product was hardly observed (data not shown). Second, since 3'-OH of the transcript can be ligated with 5'-monophosphate of itself, self-ligation of the transcript was occurred (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lane 1-2). For blocking of the 3'-OH of the transcript, the DNA oligomer prRT- was hybridized to 3'-terminus region of the transcript before ligation reaction (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Self-ligation was effectively prevented (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lane 4-5) and yield of desired product was increased from 10 % to 90 % (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, lane 1 and 4). This blocking method is simple and effective compared with other methods (e.g., making 2', 3'-cyclic phosphate group by self-cleavage of ribozyme placed at 3'-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> or cleavage with deoxyribozyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>.). Third, it is reported that T4 RNA ligase does not prefer guanine residue as a phosphate donor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, but common promoters for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription start the transcription with guanine residue, which is located at 5'-terminus of transcripts and act as phosphate donor in ligation reaction. Therefore, it is suspected that the transcripts generated by guanine-initiation type promoter are not suitable for donor substrate of T4 RNA ligase. Hence, We applied T7&#x003c6;2.5 promoter, which initiates the transcription with adenine residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, because adenine is better than guanine as a donor substrate of T4 RNA ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>. We compared the ligation efficiency of transcripts generated by three kind of promoters; T7, SP6 and T7&#x003c6;2.5. These promoters generate the fixed triplet sequence at 5'-terminus of the transcripts; GGG, GAA and AGG respectively. The transcript by T7&#x003c6;2.5 promoter gave the best efficiency of over 80 %. For SP6 and T7, the efficiency saturated at about 55 % and 20 %, respectively (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Aminoacylation of tRNA and conjugation between hydrazide-linker and aminoacyl-tRNA</title><p>tRNA<sup>Asn</sup><sub>CUA </sub>was acylated with 4-acetyl-L-phenylalanine using resin-immobilized ribozyme and aminoacylation efficiency was analyzed using a streptavidin-dependent gel-shift assay after biotinylation of the &#x003b1;-amino group of 4-acetyl-L-phenylalanine. The efficiency was approximately 15 % in our procedure (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A).</p><p>The yield of conjugation between mRNA-linker-hydrazide and 4-acetyl-L-phenylalanyl tRNA<sup>Asn</sup><sub>CUA</sub> was estimated as follows. 7.5 pmol of hydrazide-linker and 75 pmol of 4-acetyl-L-phenylalanyl tRNA<sup>Asn</sup><sub>CUA</sub> were incubated in 5 &#x000b5;l of 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) for overnight at room temperature. The mixture was mixed with equal volume of loading buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate, 8 M urea, 0.05 % bromophenol blue, 0.05 % xylene cyanol, pH 5.0) and analyzed by 8 M urea 15 % PAGE using 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) as a running buffer at 30 &#x000b0;C and visualized with fluorescence of FITC and then visualized again after staining by SYBR Green II. The yield of the conjugation was approximately 10 % because of 90 % of hydrazide-linker was left without conjugation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). This yield may be including the event of hydrolysis of aminoacyl-tRNA that has been conjugated to hydrazide-linker.</p></sec><sec><title>Selective enrichment analysis</title><p>We demonstrated a model selection experiment using a histidine-tag having high affinity to Ni<sup>2+</sup>. The translation product displaying the His-tag peptide was screened using a Ni-NTA agarose column. The bound sample was eluted and used as a template for RT-PCR. As negative controls, the translation product without methionine that is necessary to initiate translation and the translation product without modification of 4-acethyl-phenylalanine sup tRNA to the linker before translation were screened with Ni-NTA agarose. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis and the desired product with higher amount was confirmed than one of negative controls generated by non-specific binding (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A).</p><p>Next, we performed enrichment experiments for the DNA mixture. It was achieved to enrich the DNA encoding the His-tag sequence from a mixture containing an order of magnitude excess of the other DNA encoding FLAG-tag sequence (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A) in three rounds screening with Ni-NTA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). Furthermore, enrichment of the DNA encoding the FLAG-tag sequence from a mixture containing an order of magnitude excess of the other DNA encoding His-tag sequence was also accomplished in single round screening with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). Additionally, we also performed enrichment experiments using another translation system (PURESYSTEM) and achieved the enrichment of desired sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C). These results indicated that the enrichment was not an artefact by nonspecific binding of displayed peptide but a fact by specific binding of each peptide sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of the mRNA-peptide fusion</title><p>The mRNA-linker ligation product encoding the FLAG peptide was translated and the mRNA-peptide fusion product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Although the migration of the band caused by fusion formation was not detected on SDS-PAGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A), the fusion molecule was detected by the western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). This low yield of the fusion formation was corresponding to relatively low efficiency of the selective enrichment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B, C). The low yield (~10 %) of the linker-aminoacyl-tRNA conjugate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B) affected directly the yield of the final product. In general, non-natural amino acid possessing large side group was incorporated into protein with relatively low efficiency. However, it is also reported that incorporation efficiency was not dependent on size of side group but on its shape, and the linear shape was appropriate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>. In addition, non-natural amino acids possessing relatively long side chain (BODIPY FL-X-aminophenylalanine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref> or &#x003b5;-N-biotinyl-L-lysine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) were also successfully incorporated into the polypeptide. The side chain of the amino acid used in this study was linear and did not contain any large aromatic ring. However, since the side chain of the non-natural amino acid used in this study was extraordinarily long, this amino acid may be difficult to be incorporated into polypeptide or premature termination may be occur during peptide chain elongation if this amino acid was incorporated. The linker length also must affect the formation efficiency of the mRNA-peptide fusion. Therefore, experimental optimization of the linker length will give better efficiency although the length of the linker used in this study was optimized theoretically.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>4. Conclusion</title><p>We have developed a new method to prepare an mRNA-peptide fusion molecule covalently linked via N-terminus during <italic>in vitro </italic>translation. Because this fusion molecule displays the C-terminus of the peptide, it makes it possible to selection of the peptides for which function the C-terminus is essential. And also because this fused molecule has the free 3'-terminus of mRNA, it would make it possible to select an RNA replicase of de novo initiation-type.</p><p>And because a stop codon is inserted near downstream of the initiation codon, the translation reaction terminates just after initiation unless the sup tRNA is incorporated. Therefore unfused peptides that must compete with the fused peptides are never generated. Furthermore, this system is able to work even if the mRNA contains a termination codon. This method may be extended to the fusion formation linked at any position of protein by changing the position of amber codon that corresponds to the incorporation site of the linked aminoacyl sup tRNA. Thus, it may be possible that displaying the protein which having free terminus at both end and that arbitrary selection of the linking point on the protein according to its structure.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was partially supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) and by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Area No. 14085203 from MEXT, Japan.</p></ack><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term id="GL1">FITC</term><def><p>fluorescein isothiocyanate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL2">NTA</term><def><p>nitrilotriacetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL3">sup tRNA</term><def><p>suppressor tRNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="GL4">SAv</term><def><p>streptavidin.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Nemoto</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Miyamoto-Sato</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Husimi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Yanagawa</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><article-title>In vitro virus: Bonding of mRNA bearing puromycin at the 3'-terminal end to the C-terminal end of its encoded protein on the ribosome in vitro</article-title><source>FEBS Lett</source><year>1997</year><volume>414</volume><fpage>405</fpage><lpage>408</lpage>

The dsDNA library is transcribed to mRNA. The mRNA is hybridized to the DNA moiety of the linker having hydrazide group and ligated with T4 RNA ligase. Hydrazide group of the ligated product and acetyl group of the phenylalanine derivative that is acylated to sup tRNA are ligated chemically and the modified mRNA is translated. The modified aminoacyl sup tRNA tends to occupy the A-site of ribosome at UAG codon inserted near downstream of initiation codon and the phenylalanine is incorporated into the growing peptide. Thus, linkage between N-terminus of the nascent peptide and 5'-terminus of its mRNA is achieved.

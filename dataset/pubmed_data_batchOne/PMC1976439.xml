In this study, we examined if the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the 9-kb HIV-1 RNA genome can interact. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays demonstrated a specific interaction between transcripts encompassing the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; terminal 1&#x02009;kb, suggesting that the HIV-1 RNA genome can circularize. Truncation of the transcripts indicated that the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; interaction is formed by 600&#x02013;700&#x02009;nt in the gag open reading frame and the terminal 123&#x02009;nt of the genomic RNA. Detailed RNA structure probing indicates that sequences flanking the 3&#x02032; TAR hairpin interact with complementary sequences in the gag gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that all HIV-1 subtypes can form the 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; interaction despite considerable sequence divergence, suggesting an important role of RNA circularization in the HIV-1 replication cycle.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA structures play important roles in the HIV-1 life cycle and several structured motifs are clustered in the untranslated regions (UTR) that are present at both ends of the viral RNA. The 5&#x02032;UTR contains the repeat region (R), U5 region (unique at the 5&#x02032; terminus) and the leader sequence. The R region folds the TAR and the polyA hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), and TAR binds the viral Tat protein to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Among many other RNA signals, the dimer initiation site (DIS) is located in the HIV-1 leader RNA and forms a stem-loop structure with a palindromic sequence. Direct base pairing between the loop-exposed palindromes of two DIS hairpins results in RNA dimerization. The 3&#x02032;UTR is subdivided into the U3 (unique at the 3&#x02032; terminus) and the R region. The 3&#x02032;R also folds the TAR hairpin, but the polyA hairpin is shortened due to polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

The HIV-1 genomic RNA, the untranslated R, U5, U3 regions and all open reading frames are indicated. The secondary structures of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;R domains are shown on top. To map the sequences involved in the 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; interaction we made transcripts that are truncated from the 3&#x02032; terminus by 100&#x02009;nt steps. Their ability to form the 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; interaction is indicated by +/&#x02212;.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm564f1"/></fig></p><p>HIV-1 full-length RNA serves both as mRNA for the Gag-Pol proteins and as genomic RNA that is packaged in virion particles. It therefore contains characteristics for both functions. HIV-1 genomic RNA is 5&#x02032;-capped and 3&#x02032;-polyadenylated like cellular mRNAs, but it performs some unique virus-specific functions, such as dimerization, packaging in virion particles and reverse transcription. Reverse transcription is initiated within the leader RNA and the initial copy DNA of the 5&#x02032;R is transferred to the 3&#x02032; to allow copying of the full-length genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). It has been suggested that the 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; ends should be close together in virions to facilitate this obligatory strand transfer step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Cellular mRNAs and the RNA genomes of several viruses were demonstrated to have a 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">6&#x02013;12</xref>). Specifically, genome circularization plays a role in RNA viruses that lack the cap structure (the Picornaviridae family), the polyA tail (the Reoviridae family) or both elements (the Flaviridae family). In some cases, a protein bridge is involved in RNA circularization, e.g. for members of the Picornaviridae and the Reoviridae family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Sequences in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end of the RNA genome base pair in members of the Flaviridae family and the LTR-retrotransposon Ty1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The retrotransposon Ty1 shares several features with HIV-1, including its genome organization and the process of reverse transcription. Ty1 RNA circularization was shown to be involved in reverse transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). It has been suggested that RNA circularization is a common feature of all RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). We therefore set out to test this for HIV-1 RNA using <italic>in vitro</italic> assays.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA templates for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription</title><p>The full-length HIV-1 molecular clone pLAI was used as a template for PCR amplification of certain genome regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).

To prevent homodimerization of the 5&#x02032; transcript, we used the GC1 mutant with a deletion in the loop of the DIS hairpin. This mutation has previously been demonstrated to effectively block <italic>in vitro</italic> HIV-1 RNA dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). We first checked for the lack of homodimerization. Incubation of the radiolabeled 5&#x02032; transcript with increasing amounts of non-radiolabeled 5&#x02032; transcript in physiological salt buffer and analysis on a non-denaturing gel did not show homodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, first 5 lanes), demonstrating the effectiveness of the DIS mutation. The 3&#x02032; transcript is not expected to form homodimers, although a small amount of slow-migrating complexes are observed (20%) at the highest RNA concentration (290&#x02009;nM, lane 10). We next mixed the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; transcripts. The mixture was heated in physiological salt buffer to 75&#x000b0;C and slowly cooled to room temperature and analyzed on gel. The radiolabeled 5&#x02032; transcript was incubated with increasing amounts of non-labeled 3&#x02032; transcript, and the radiolabeled 3&#x02032; transcript was incubated with an increasing amount of non-labeled 5&#x02032; transcript.

A representative sequence was selected for subtype A1, A2, B, C, D, AE, F, G, H and J. We fused fragments 600&#x02013;700&#x02009;nt and 9079&#x02013;9229&#x02009;nt (subtype B LAI coordinates) <italic>in silico</italic> and analyzed the RNA secondary structure with Mfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The proposed 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; interaction can be formed by all HIV-1 subtypes, despite significant sequence variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). All subtypes form a similar long distance base-pairing interaction between gag and U3. Within the gag&#x02013;U3 interaction, a typical 4-nucleotide pyrimidine bulge that is flanked by two stretches of interacting nucleotides is apparent in several subtypes. One of these stretches, which is boxed in subtype A1, is analyzed in more detail in the insert of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. This stretch can be formed by all subtypes and is supported by some interesting base-pairing co-variations. In particular, the marked C-G base pair of subtype A1, B, D and F (insert of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) is changed to U-G in subtype C, E and J, and true co-variations are also seen: A-U for subtype A2 and U-A for subtype H. The observation that the 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; interaction is conserved among the HIV-1 subtypes strongly suggests a role for this interaction in HIV-1 replication.

Mapping of the minimal domains indicated that the interaction is formed by a 5&#x02032; sequence in the gag open reading frame and the 3&#x02032;-terminal U3R region. Transcripts comprising these short sequences form a complex with a similar <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> as the complex formed by the 1-kb transcripts, confirming that we identified the minimal sequences that constitute the 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; interaction. Detailed RNA structure probing indicates that sequences flanking the 3&#x02032; TAR hairpin base pair with gag sequences. This gag&#x02013;U3R interaction can be formed by all HIV-1 subtypes despite considerable sequence variation, thus providing phylogenetic support for the proposed interaction. Further experimentation is needed to elucidate the exact role of RNA circularization in the HIV-1 life cycle.</p><p>The proposed gag&#x02013;U3R interaction is supported by the result of two previous studies. Kanevsky <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) analyzed the role of secondary structure in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;R regions on the strand transfer process of reverse transcription. This study used RNA structure probing to show that the TAR hairpin is present at both ends, but the polyA hairpin is presented differently, either in extended form (5&#x02032;) or shortened form (3&#x02032;) due to 3&#x02032;-polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, this study also placed the R region within the gag coding sequence. In this context, the shorter 3&#x02032; polyA hairpin is no longer observed, possibly due to pairing with gag sequences. Because the RNA structure probing data reveal a surprisingly strong correlation with our probing data, the same interaction between gag and polyA sequences may be formed. In another study, Gee <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) used computational folding predictions of the 5&#x02032; and the 3&#x02032; polyA hairpin on transcripts encompassing the 5&#x02032;-terminal 662&#x02009;nt fused to the 3&#x02032; region of subtypes AE, AG, B and D. The 5&#x02032; polyA sequence predominantly folds the polyA hairpin, but the 3&#x02032; polyA sequence preferentially interacts with a sequence in gag. This structure, which was predicted for all four subtypes, is the same as the gag&#x02013;U3R interaction described in this study. Since only the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; 1000&#x02009;nt were examined in this study, we cannot exclude the possibility that other sequences might influence the gag&#x02013;U3R interaction. Computational RNA structure predictions of complete genomic sequences revealed that such interactions are not expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Circularization of HIV-1 RNA seems exclusive for unspliced genomic RNA because all spliced subgenomic mRNAs lack the gag interaction domain. The gag&#x02013;U3R interaction may distinguish genomic RNA from spliced transcripts and could thus function in genomic RNA-specific processes, e.g. packaging and reverse transcription. Especially for the latter process, the gag&#x02013;U3R distance interaction may bring both ends of the genomic RNA close together. During reverse transcription, the (&#x02013;) strong-stop DNA is transferred to the 3&#x02032;R sequence to allow reverse transcription to proceed. Bringing the 5&#x02032; and the 3&#x02032; ends of the genomic RNA together could facilitate this strand transfer step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Furthermore, a long distance RNA interaction between the 5&#x02032; polyA region and a sequence in gag was described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Surprisingly, this gag sequence is located only 170&#x02009;nt upstream of the gag domain that interacts with U3R. Combining the two long-distance RNA interactions would bring the 5&#x02032;R and 3&#x02032;R sequences in very close proximity, which may facilitate strand transfer. The gag&#x02013;U3R interaction may also positively influence polyadenylation at the 3&#x02032; polyA site, which is inhibited by the polyA hairpin as present in 5&#x02032;R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>RNA circularization has been described for several positive-stranded RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Circularization plays an important role in essential steps of the viral replication cycle such as translation, transcription and reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">6&#x02013;12</xref>). The 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032; interaction in HIV-1 is similar to the long-distance interaction described for the retrotransposon Ty1. For Ty1, gag sequences base pair with the U3 domain, and circularization of the retrotransposon RNA genome is required for efficient reverse transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). For HIV-1 RNA, there are multiple sequence motifs near the 5&#x02032; end that regulate initiation of reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>), but there is no evidence that the 3&#x02032; end is involved. Further research will be needed to address this issue.</p><p>The HIV-1 genome contains many inhibitory sequences (INS) that block RNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). One INS element is located within the gag sequence that is involved in the gag&#x02013;U3R interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The gag sequence has been reported to bind polyA-binding protein (PABP1), which usually interacts with the 3&#x02032;-polyA tail of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Gag mutations that prevent binding of PABP1 increase gag translation significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). It has been speculated that PABP1 binds to the 3&#x02032; polyA tail at low concentrations, but also to the INS in gag at higher concentrations. Since PABP1 can multimerize, the proteins bound to gag and the 3&#x02032; polyA tail could also interact, thus forming a 5&#x02032;/3&#x02032;-protein bridge. The possibility that PABP1 modulates the gag&#x02013;U3R interaction is an interesting option.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>RNA research in the Berkhout lab is sponsored by ZonMw (Vici grant) and NWO-CW (Top grant).

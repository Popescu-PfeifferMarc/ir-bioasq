This study presents evidence that the N-terminal region of CSB interacts with the SH3 domain of c-Abl <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, c-Abl kinase phosphorylates CSB at Tyr932. The subcellular localization of CSB to the nucleus and nucleolus is altered after phosphorylation by c-Abl. c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of CSB increased in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide and decreased in cells pre-treated with STI-571, a c-Abl-specific protein kinase inhibitor. Activation of the c-Abl kinase in response to oxidative damage is not observed in CSB null cells. These results suggest that c-Abl and CSB may regulate each other in a reciprocal manner in response to oxidative stress.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cockayne Syndrome (CS) is a hereditary human disease characterized by profound deficiency of post-natal growth with heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and neural degeneration resembling premature aging. CS is associated with defective transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). At the cellular/molecular level, the phenotype of CS includes sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation and delayed recovery of RNA and DNA synthesis after exposure to UV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>) There are two CS complementation groups, A and B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), corresponding to genetic defects in the <italic>CSA</italic> and <italic>CSB</italic> genes, respectively. The <italic>CSB</italic> gene encodes a 168-kDa protein which is a member of the SWI/SNF family of DNA-dependent ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Previous studies show that primary cells from CS patients have a defect in initiating (i.e. incision) repair of oxidative DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In addition, cells that are deficient in CSB-dependent ATPase (motif VI mutants) are sensitive to &#x003b3;-irradiation and defective in general genome repair of oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These data suggest that CSB may play a role in repair of oxidative DNA damage via the base excision repair (BER) pathway.</p><p>c-Abl is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase whose activities are tightly regulated in the cell. For example, both nuclear and cytoplasmic c-Abl is activated in response to genotoxic or oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>), or by a protein kinase C&#x003b4; (PKC&#x003b4;)-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Activated c-Abl plays a role in inducing apoptosis and/or necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) after exposure to oxidative and other types of cellular stress. c-Abl is phosphorylated by DNA-PK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and interacts with DNA repair associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#x02013;23</xref>) including p53, p73 and Rad9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>). Oxidative stress activates c-Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Structure-function analysis of c-Abl indicates that it has a protein&#x02013;protein interaction SH3 domain, which is likely to participate in interactions between c-Abl and its kinase substrates. SH3 domains bind preferentially to proline-rich motifs such as P-X-X-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). CSB is a phosphoprotein with an N-terminal proline-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). No prior reports have indicated that CSB undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation.</p><p>Tyrosine phosphorylation, particularly by c-Abl tyrosine kinase, has been reported to play a role in the regulation of some DNA repair proteins. c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of DNA-topoisomerase I (topo I) at Tyr268 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells conferred activation of the topo I function (31). Moreover, activation of c-Abl by treatment of cells with ionizing radiation was associated with c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of topo I and induction of topo I activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Rad51 is a key element of recombinational DNA repair and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue at position 315 by c-Abl tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). This study explores the interactions between c-Abl and CSB and the role of this interaction in the response to oxidative DNA damage. Evidence is presented that CSB binds to c-Abl and is a substrate for c-Abl tyrosine kinase. We speculate that tyrosine phosphorylation of CSB plays an important role in regulating and/or coordinating the cellular response to oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>CS1AN.S3.G2 (CS1AN) cells, a SV40- transformed human CS-B fibroblast, either with empty vector or complemented with wild-type CSB, E646Q, Q942E point mutants, ECFP-CSB were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50&#x02009;U of penicillin/ml, 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of streptomycin/ml and 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of genetectin/ml or neomycin (ECFP-CSB).

Autophosphorylation of c-Abl was significantly induced in cells expressing wild-type (WT) CSB and motif VI mutant CSB but not in cells expressing the CSB motif II mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Tyrosine-phosphorylation increased significantly for WT CSB, but less for the motif VI mutant and not at all for the motif II mutant of CSB.

Oxidative damage did not result in Abl auto-phosphorylation or tyrosine-phosphorylation of CSB in AG05012 or AG01428 primary fibroblasts obtained from CS patients. However, a significant auto-phosphorylation of c-Abl followed by a resultant tyrosine phosphorylation of CSB was observed in GM00969 and AG08470 fibroblasts derived from matched normal human subjects, after oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Pre-treatment with STI-571 inhibited auto-phosphorylation of c-Abl and tyrosine-phosphorylation of CSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C).

CSB interacts with and is tyrosine phosphorylated by c-Abl <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Serine and threonine phosphorylation of CSB were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), but this is the first report of tyrosine phosphorylation of CSB. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CSB is constitutive in CML K562 lymphoblasts. Also, wild-type MEFs exposed to hydrogen peroxide have increased CSB tyrosine-phosphorylation while it is lacking in Abl-/- MEFs. Tyrosine 932, which lies in motif VI of the ATPase domain of CSB, is the site of CSB phosphorylation by c-Abl. Oxidative stress stimulates c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of CSB and this event is blocked by STI-571, a specific inhibitor of c-Abl kinase. Oxidative stress-induced c-Abl auto-phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of CSB appear to require CSB ATPase, because it was not observed in cells expressing an ATPase-deficient mutant of CSB. These data suggest that CSB and c-Abl may participate in and possibly regulate a common oxidative stress-response pathway.</p><p>c-Abl is a tightly regulated non-receptor tyrosine kinase that contains a Src homology domain 3 (SH3). The SH3 domain is a protein&#x02013;protein interaction region which usually binds to proline-rich motifs (P-X-X-P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). This study shows that the interaction between c-Abl and CSB is mediated by the c-Abl SH3 domain and the N-terminal 355 amino acids of CSB (aa 1&#x02013;355). This region of CSB includes a proline-rich motif at aa 301&#x02013;304 (PVTP).</p><p>CSB cells and cell extracts are deficient in incision at 8-oxoguanine and 8-oxoadenine lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9">8&#x02013;9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) suggesting that CSB may play a role in the repair of these lesions. These lesions are believed to be removed by BER, and there is additional evidence for a role of CSB in the general genome BER pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Additional evidence comes from studies in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) where increased accumulation of 8-oxoG is observed when mice are deficient in OGG1 in addition to lacking CSB. Also CSB is in protein complex with OGG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) although 8-oxo-G appears to be removed by general genome BER, and there is no indication of transcription coupled repair of this lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). This deficiency in 8-oxoguanine incision activity is complemented by ectopic expression of WT CSB; the deficiency is partially complemented by a motif II CSB mutant (ATPase deficient, E646Q) but not complemented by motif VI (Q942E) CSB mutants. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). This result suggests that domain VI of CSB is required for repair of oxidative DNA lesions such as 8-oxoguanine. It is interesting to note that Tyr932, the site of c-Abl mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of CSB, also resides in domain VI of CSB protein.</p><p>In cells exposed to oxidative stress, c-Abl auto-phosphorylation and its phosphorylation of CSB increases. However, these effects are reduced and a lower extent of phosphorylation occurs in cells expressing the motif VI (Q942E) CSB mutant. CSB motif II is also required for these phosphorylation events, because they do not increase in response to oxidative damage in cells expressing a motif II CSB mutant or in cells lacking CSB. CSB is also required for oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of Crk, a previously characterized substrate of c-Abl. This finding of the requirement of CSB in the activation of c-Abl during oxidative damage might have a greater role in the understanding of mechanisms of leukemia in CML patients. A constitutively active Abl and Bcr-abl feature the physiology of CML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Furthermore, a disruption of the <italic>CSB</italic> gene product has been reported as a possible anti-cancer target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). It is possible that the disruption of <italic>CSB</italic> might help in the inactivation of Abl in case of CML. In addition, the lack of skin cancer in CSB patients might be due to the fact that because of lack of CSB in these patients, activation of c-Abl is hindered inhibiting the process of onset of carcinogenesis. These findings suggest that CSB may regulate auto-phosphorylation and activation of c-Abl in response to oxidative stress and it might play a role in the development of cancer. In addition, we also speculate that tyrosine phosphorylated CSB may play a specific role in regulating the response to oxidative DNA damage.</p><p>This study also shows that CSB and c-Abl co-localize in the nucleus and re-distribute in the nucleolus in cells treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This co-localization is inhibited by pre-treatment with STI-571. The redistribution of c-Abl and CSB may facilitate interaction between the two proteins and tyrosine phosphorylation of CSB. Alternatively, phosphorylation of CSB might promote its redistribution to sites of oxidative damage; this is consistent with the observation that redistribution of CSB and c-Abl is inhibited by STI-571. Furthermore, c-Abl and CSB do not co-localize to the nucleolus in unstressed cells, suggesting that activation of c-Abl may play a role in initiating redistribution. In future experiments, CSB tyrosine 932 mutants could be used to determine the role of c-Abl mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of CSB in the process of CSB redistribution and in the response to oxidative stress.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that c-Abl interacts with and tyrosine phosphorylates CSB. This interaction may play an important role in the response to oxidative stress, resulting in activation of c-Abl, tyrosine phosphorylation of CSB and more efficient BER of oxidative DNA damage. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CSB may serve as a signal for repair proteins to localize to DNA damage and may help maintain active transcription in the nucleolus. These data also provide a first insight into a novel possible role of CSB as a signaling molecule in response to oxidative damage. This role can further be exploited to understand the phenotype of CS as well as in a general understanding of the role of CSB in response to various oxidative and DNA damage. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of tyrosine phosphorylation on the physiologically important functions of CSB <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Drs Michael Seidman and Mohammed Hedayati for careful reading of the manuscript.

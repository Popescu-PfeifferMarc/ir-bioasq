Here, we determined the effect of <sc>L</sc>-arginine, <sc>D</sc>-arginine and non-&#x003b1; amino acids on cellular uptake, splice-correction activity, cellular toxicity and serum binding for 24 CPP<bold>&#x02212;</bold>PMOs. Insertion of 6-aminohexanoic acid (X) or &#x003b2;-alanine (B) residues into oligoarginine R<sub>8</sub> decreased the cellular uptake but increased the splice-correction activity of the resulting compound, with a greater increase for the sequences containing more X residues. Cellular toxicity was not observed for any of the conjugates up to 10&#x02009;<bold>&#x003bc;</bold>M. Up to 60&#x02009;<bold>&#x003bc;</bold>M, only the conjugates with &#x02a7e; 5 Xs exhibited time- and concentration-dependent toxicity. Substitution of <sc>L</sc>-arginine with <sc>D</sc>-arginine did not increase uptake or splice-correction activity. High concentration of serum significantly decreased the uptake and splice-correction activity of oligoarginine conjugates, but had much less effect on the conjugates containing X or B. In summary, incorporation of X/B into oligoarginine enhanced the antisense activity and serum-binding profile of CPP&#x02212;PMO. Toxicity of X/B-containing conjugates was affected by the number of Xs, treatment time and concentration. More active, stable and less toxic CPPs can be designed by optimizing the position and number of R, <sc>D</sc>-R, X and B residues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Steric-blocking antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) are considered potential therapeutics for genetic diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and &#x003b2;-thalassemia. For their potential to be realized, however, the AOs must be effectively delivered to cell nuclei. Cationic lipoplex- or PEI-based transfection methods used to deliver charged AOs are not suitable for the delivery of uncharged AOs such as phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Conjugation of PMO to short CPPs is a good method to enhance the cytoplasmic and nuclear delivery of PMO because the conjugates are simple to use and because the short peptides and their AO conjugates can be easily manufactured and characterized in a quality-controlled manner. Examples of well-studied CPP&#x02212;PMO conjugates include those with Tat and oligoarginine peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>)
<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Structures of PMO and (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212; PMO conjugate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm478f1"/></fig></p><p>Important considerations in the design of effective CPPs include the ability to deliver AO efficiently, stability in living systems and toxicity. We have reported that Tat and oligoarginine peptides are not stable in human serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and are therefore ill-suited for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications. Oligoarginine peptides incorporating non-&#x003b1; amino acids have been proven superior to oligoarginine alone. CPPs containing 6-aminohexanoic acid (X) and &#x003b2;-alanine (B) were more stable in human serum than Tat or oligoarginine peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). A CPP&#x02212;PMO conjugate, (RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212;PMO, has been shown to be more efficient in the correction of pre-mRNA mis-splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and in inhibition of the replication of mouse hepatitis virus <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) than an oligoarginine peptide. In addition, (RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212;PMO conjugates have been shown to cause effective exon skipping in muscle cells from DMD dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), in human muscle explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and in <italic>mdx</italic> mice (10), as well as inhibiting the replication of various viruses in cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>) and in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>The above studies have helped make it clear that unnatural amino acids can confer enhanced stability and activity, and therefore improve the potential of CPPs to deliver therapeutic PMO. In pursuit of CPPs with improved characteristics, we have carried out a structure&#x02013;activity relationship study to investigate the effects of unnatural amino acid insertions in oligoarginine peptides on cellular delivery, nuclear antisense activity, toxicity and serum-binding characteristics of the resulting CPP&#x02212;PMO conjugates. The unnatural amino acids studied here are X, B and <sc>D</sc>-arginine (r). We chose to study the X amino acid based on the successes of the (RXR)<sub>4</sub> CPP in several studies as shown in the previous paragraph. B and r amino acids were chosen because they have good enzymatic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The CPPs are (i) the oligoarginine sequences, R<sub>8</sub> and R<sub>9</sub>, (ii) sequences with RXR, RX and RB repeats, as well as various combinations thereof, and (iii) sequences containing <sc>D</sc>-arginine, r<sub>8</sub>, (rX)<sub>8</sub> (rXR)<sub>4</sub>, (rXr)<sub>4</sub> and (rB)<sub>8</sub>. The CPP&#x02212;PMO conjugates were evaluated for their relative (a) cellular uptake, as determined by flow cytometry, (b) antisense activity, as determined by a splice correction assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and (c) cellular toxicity, as determined by MTT cell viability, propidium iodide membrane integrity and hemolysis assays, as well as by microscopic imaging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Synthesis of CPP&#x02013;PMO conjugates</title><p>CPP nomenclature and sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Chemical structures of PMO and (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The antisense PMO (CCT CTT ACC TCA GTT ACA) is designed to target a &#x003b2;-thalassemic mutant splice site present in the human &#x003b2;-globin intron 2 of a positive-readout antisense activity assay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) as described in the Results section. Synthesis of PMO, described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">16</xref>), and the CPPs, using standard Fmoc chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), were performed at AVI BioPharma, achieving purities of &#x0003e;90% as determined by HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Conjugation of a CPP to a PMO through an amide linker, described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), was followed with an additional purification step to remove nonconjugated peptide. Samples were loaded on source 30S resin (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA) in a 2&#x02009;ml Biorad (Hercules, CA) MT2 column at 2&#x02009;ml/min with running buffer A (20&#x02009;mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 25% acetonitrile, pH 7.0) and purified into 45-s fractions with 0&#x02013;35% buffer gradient (buffer B: 1.5M NaCl, 20&#x02009;mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 25% acetonitrile, pH 7.0) over 60&#x02009;min, using a Biorad BioLogic low pressure chromatography system. The desired faction was desalted by a method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). HPLC and MS analyses revealed that the final product contained &#x0003e;90% CPP conjugated to full-length PMO, with the balance composed of CPP conjugated to incomplete PMO sequence, nonconjugated full-length or incomplete PMO.

This assay utilizes the ability of steric-blocking AOs to block a splice site created by a mutation in order to restore normal splicing. The luciferase coding sequence was interrupted by the human &#x003b2;-globin thalassemic intron 2 which carried a mutated splice site at nucleotide 705. HeLa cells were stably transfected with the plasmid therefore named as pLuc705 cell. In the pLuc705 system, steric-blocking AOs must be present in the cell nucleus for splicing correction to occur. Advantages of this system include the positive readout and high signal-to-noise ratio. With this system the relative efficiencies of various CPPs to deliver an AO with sequence appropriate for splice-correction to cell nuclei can be easily compared.</p><sec><title>Oligoarginine, RX, RXR and RB panels</title><p>The CPP conjugates with the highest nuclear antisense activities were (RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212; and (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B show luciferase activity normalized to protein of cells treated with various conjugates at 1 and 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M for 24&#x02009;h.

We reasoned that one approach to improve stability would be to use non-&#x003b1; amino acids or <sc>D</sc>-amino acids. In this study, we investigated whether incorporation of 6-aminohexanoic acid (X), &#x003b2;-alanine (B) and <sc>D</sc>-arginine (r) amino acids into the CPP would affect cellular delivery, antisense activity, toxicity and serum binding of the resulting CPP&#x02212;PMO conjugates.</p><p>We found that CPP&#x02212;PMOF conjugates containing X/B residues did not enter cells as efficiently as R<sub>8</sub>&#x02212; and R<sub>9</sub>&#x02212;PMO conjugates. This is consistent with our previous finding for the (RXR)<sub>4</sub> conjugate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We have found that cell surface proteoglycans were involved with binding of the Tat&#x02212;, R<sub>9</sub>F<sub>2</sub>&#x02212; and (RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212;PMO conjugates with the (RXR)<sub>4</sub> conjugate having the lowest binding affinity. Insertion of X into an oligoarginine CPP reduces the charge density and may lead to decreased binding affinity for proteoglycans. Despite the lower cellular uptake of X/B-containing CPP&#x02013;PMO, they generated higher antisense activities in the cell nucleus than oligoarginine&#x02212;PMO. We have found that endocytosis was the internalization mechanism (at least primarily) for oligoarginine- and (RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212;PMO conjugates. Indication of different uptake mechanisms was not found among these conjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Therefore we hypothesize that X/B-containing conjugates have a greater ability to escape from endosomes/lysosomes than oligoarginine conjugates by a mechanism as yet to be studied.</p><p>The number of X residues affects both the nuclear antisense activity and the toxicity of conjugates. The CPP&#x02212;PMO conjugate with 8 X residues [(RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO] had the highest activity followed by one with 5 Xs [(RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212;PMO] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, these conjugates were toxic to cells at higher concentrations, which may be a concern when considering potential applications for <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery of PMO. Replacement of all 8 Xs with Bs decreased both toxicity and antisense activity. The combination of 3&#x02013;4 Xs with several B residues yielded CPPs with no detectable toxicity, and at some concentrations several of them had similar antisense activity as (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO. We think this type of CPP, having Bs and fewer than 5 Xs, will offer balanced activity and low toxicity as well as the stability, and have considerable potential for delivery of therapeutic AOs. Further investigation into the toxicity and activity versus dosing levels of these CPPs <italic>in vivo</italic> is warranted.</p><p>Surprisingly, the replacement of <sc>L</sc>-arginine with <sc>D</sc>-arginine enhanced neither uptake nor antisense activity for oligoarginine, or X- and B-containing conjugates. In the case of (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO, the replacement actually caused a small but statistically significant decrease in activity. Our observation is different from the results reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">21</xref>) who found that <sc>D</sc>-CPPs had higher cellular uptake than <sc>L</sc>-CPPs, although no biological functional cargo was used in their study. The difference between results may be due to the type and size of cargos and the cell lines used for the assays. Whether the use of <sc>D</sc>-arginine-containing peptides results in superior CPP&#x02212;PMO functional activity <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be tested.</p><p>We attempted to understand the nature of (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212; and (RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212;PMO toxicity. It is apparent that these two conjugates caused little immediate membrane damage with 0.5 or 5&#x02009;h treatment at concentrations as high as 60&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). However, these two conjugates had dose-dependent toxicity with 24 hr treatment as shown by the leaky cell membranes and fewer cells compared to controls (Figure 6C&#x00026;D, Figure 8). Interestingly, the replacement of Xs with Bs in (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO abolished the toxicity, and the replacement of <sc>L</sc>-arginine with <sc>D</sc>-arginine reduced the toxicity of (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). We have found that (rX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO was completely stable and the peptide portion of (RB)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO was only partially degraded, whereas the peptide portion of (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO was completely degraded in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). We wondered whether the difference in toxicity among (RX)<sub>8</sub>, (RB)<sub>8</sub> and (rX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO conjugates was caused by differences in intracellular stability, resulting in the metabolized products of (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO producing toxicity. The identifiable metabolized products of (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO were XRXB&#x02212;PMO and XB&#x02212;PMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) but neither product had any detectable toxicity as measured by MTT assay (data not shown). It is possible that the CPP portion was degraded into free amino acids and/or smaller peptide fragments which were toxic. However, our investigation revealed that neither free R nor X, alone or in combination, caused cellular toxicity. Another possibility is that because of the high hydrophobicity of X compared to B, X in combination with positively charged arginine residues leads to toxicity not generated by B residue combinations. However, this explanation does not account for the difference in toxicity observed between (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO and (rX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO, which have the same hydrophobicity. Perhaps the toxicity of (RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212;PMO and (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO was caused by the peptide fragments that we could not identify by mass spectrometry.</p><p>Unlike the toxicity difference between (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212; and (rX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO, the <sc>L</sc>&#x02192;<sc>D</sc> replacement did not change the toxicity of (RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212;PMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Substitution of either one R (rXR) or two R (rXr) from the RXR repeat neither reduced nor increased the toxicity profile of (RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212;PMO. At this point, we do not fully understand the mechanisms of (RXR)<sub>4</sub>&#x02212; and (RX)<sub>8</sub>&#x02212;PMO conjugate toxicity, but look forward to studying this topic further.</p><p>Serum effect on the activity of a CPP&#x02212;AO conjugates is an important issue when considering potential <italic>in vivo</italic> applications. X/B-containing conjugates were still active in 60% serum while oligoarginine conjugates were not. The greater stability of the X/B-containing conjugates to serum enzymes is likely a factor contributing to their high activity. The loss of activity in high serum concentrations makes oligoarginine CPPs undesirable as potential therapeutic AO carriers.</p><p>In summary, we have found that the X/B-containing CPP&#x02212;PMO conjugates are superior to oligoarginine&#x02212;PMO conjugates for the following reasons: they display higher activity in cell nuclei, are less affected by serum and are more stable in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The toxicity of the X/B-containing CPPs can be reduced by keeping the number of X residues below 5 while still maintaining a reasonable delivery efficacy and stability. This study provides a basis for further optimization of CPP sequence using R, r, X and B residues in the interest of further reducing toxicity and increasing antisense activity, which will likely lead to more effective AO transporters for potential therapeutic applications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Dr Jon D.

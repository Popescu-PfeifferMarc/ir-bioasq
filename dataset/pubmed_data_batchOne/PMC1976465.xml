Here, we described the detailed characterization of a newly discovered nuclease activity of the C-terminal domain of <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> MutS2 (ttMutS2). Using this method, the length, nucleotide content and nature of the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-termini of the product oligonucleotides were accurately identified. It is revealed that the C-terminal domain of ttMutS2 incised the phosphate backbone of oligodeoxynucleotides non-sequence-specifically at the 3&#x02032; side of the phosphates. The simultaneous identification of the innumerable fragments was achieved by the extremely high-accuracy of ESI&#x02013;FT ICR MS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nucleases play critical roles in DNA transactions including DNA replication, repair and recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). Detailed analysis of the enzymatic properties of a newly discovered nuclease activity is required in order to help identify cellular function. Nuclease digestion patterns are generally studied using radiolabeled oligonucleotides as substrate followed by electrophoretic analysis of the reaction mixture. However, this method only detects fragments containing the radiolabel. Multiple labeling of the substrate DNA is required in order to ascertain the location of all the cleaved sites. Furthermore, electrophoresis does not reveal the precise nature of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;-termini at the cleaved site. Alternatively, mass spectrometry can detect all fragments produced by the nuclease without the need for using radioisotopes. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a soft ionization technique which is suitable for large biopolymers, such as oligonucleotides, because the multiply charged ions lower the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). In addition, Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT ICR MS) is expected to achieve especially high mass accuracy in the analysis of mixtures of biopolymers and determination of the nature. In this study, we analyzed the degradation pattern of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by the catalytic domain of <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> MutS2 (ttMutS2) using ESI&#x02013;FT ICR MS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that a nuclease activity was characterized by ESI&#x02013;FT ICR MS.</p><p>Bacterial MutS2 possesses domains homologous to the MutS family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>) which are involved in DNA mismatch repair, DNA recombination and other DNA modifications. Recent studies showed that bacterial MutS2 is involved in suppression of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>) or/and protection from oxidative DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). We previously revealed that ttMutS2 contains a nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), and the activity is confined to the C-terminal domain whose sequence is not conserved in the other MutS homologs. The amino acid sequences homologous to the C-terminal domain of bacterial MutS2 distribute in variety of proteins other than MutS homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). It is also reported that the C-terminal domain of human BCL-3-binding protein shows sequence similarity to that of bacterial MutS2 and possesses a nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), although there is no relationship between the biological function of human BCL-3-binding protein and that of bacterial MutS2. The precise characteristics of their activities had been unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>The 5&#x02032;-hydroxylated 3, 7, 15, 21 and 37-mer single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized.

They were purified after synthesis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and their concentrations were determined from their absorbance at 260&#x02009;nm. The 5&#x02032;-phosphorylated or 5&#x02032;-hydroxylated single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides, 5&#x02032;-ATGTGACTCAGTATGGG-3&#x02032;, were also synthesized and purified by HPLC. Then, they were annealed to their complementary 5&#x02032;- phosphorylated or 5&#x02032;-hydroxylated single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (5&#x02032;-CCCATACTGAGTCACAT-3&#x02032;) to obtain double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides in TE buffer. Annealing was performed in a thermal cycler according to the following temperature profile: 5&#x02009;min at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by a slow decrease from 95&#x000b0;C to 37&#x000b0;C over 60&#x02009;min and from 37 to 4&#x000b0;C over 30&#x02009;min.

The 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;l aliquots were loaded into quartz nanospray emitters. All measurements were performed on an Apex IV Fourier transform mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) equipped with a 9.4-T shielded superconductive magnet. The oligonucleotide solutions were infused into an external Apollo electrospray ion source at a flow rate of 13&#x02009;&#x003bc;l/min with the assistance of N<sub>2</sub> nebulizing gas. The off-axis sprayer was grounded, and the inlet capillary was set to 1.7&#x02009;kV for generation of oligonucleotide anions. N<sub>2</sub> drying gas was applied to assist desolvation of ESI droplets. Ions were accumulated in the hexapole for 0.2&#x02009;s.

Contamination of non-volatile salts such as sodium or potassium, which would otherwise prevent ionization of the biomolecules and cause the formation of series of metal adduct ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), must be avoided. The single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) (3&#x02013;30-mer) were prepared and analyzed as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS section. Raw mass spectra consisted of a series of peaks, corresponding to multiply charged ions of intact ssDNA having a specific number of protons removed from the phosphodiester groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). As shown in inset, few metal adduct ion species were observed, showing the efficacy of the purification method. When the same sample was purified by ethanol precipitation, even the charged ions of ssDNA were hardly detected (data not shown) probably because non-volatile salts were poorly removed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, signals representing the same DNA were deconvoluted to yield the molecular mass of the corresponding DNA. Comparison of the measured molecular mass against theoretical molecular mass enabled the length and sequence of the DNA species to be identified. A deviation between the measured and theoretical molecular mass of within &#x000b1;2&#x02009;p.p.m. was deemed acceptable. Our results show that the DNA desalting method can be applied to the analysis of extremely short oligonucleotides, at least to a 3-mer.

We chose the oligonucleotide sequence shown in MATERIALS AND METHODS section as a substrate since it has left&#x02013;right asymmetric nucleotide content. Symmetric distribution of the nucleotide content will cause difficulty in identification of the fragments since various potential structures correspond to a single mass. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the deconvoluted mass spectra of reaction products. The substrate and product dsDNAs are completely denatured and detected as ssDNAs. Indeed, any remaining dsDNAs would have complicated the interpretation of the results. An increased number of peaks corresponding to DNA reaction products were detected as the enzyme concentration increased. Several peaks are more abundant than others. However, we cannot quantitatively interpret this in terms of selectivity because the nucleotide content and length seems to have an effect on the ionization efficiency of oligonucleotides (data not shown). Over 90% of these peaks were accurately identified as 5&#x02013;12-mer fragments. The major fragments identified by mass spectrometric analysis are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. This result strongly suggests that the nuclease activity of CTD has no obvious sequence-specificity. All of mass spectrometric analyses were performed in triplicate.

Some of these peaks were subsequently identified by comparison with the result of a digestion of 5&#x02032;-hydroxylated dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). When the fragment contained an unreacted 5&#x02032;-terminus, the corresponding peak would shift as far as the difference between masses of hydroxyl and phosphoryl groups. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, several peaks shifted and were identified.
<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Identification of the precise structure of the reaction products. (<bold>A</bold>) There are several potential structures corresponding to a single mass. Theoretical masses (Mt) are indicated to the right of each DNA fragment. (<bold>B</bold>) 5&#x02032;-modification of the substrate enables the precise structure of the corresponding product peak to be determined. For example, if CTD hydrolyzes a phosphodiester bond at the 5&#x02032;-side of a phosphate, only one kind of 12-mer fragment (whose theoretical mass is highlighted) will retain a hydroxyl moiety at the 5&#x02032;-end.

These results indicate that CTD incised the phosphate backbone of oligodeoxynucleotides at the 3&#x02032; side of the phosphates and the nicks generated by CTD could be ligated by DNA ligase. Thus, ESI&#x02013;FT ICR MS can identify the nature of the cleaved sites with considerable accuracy.</p><p>The nuclease activity for 17-bp dsDNA was also examined by electrophoretic analysis using a sequencing gel. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, the fragments were estimated to be 5&#x02013;12-mers by comparison to the DNA size marker made by the Maxam&#x02013;Gilbert method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These results are entirely consistent with the analysis by mass spectrometry. Although a few fragments shorter or longer than 5- or 12-mer were observed when the enzyme concentration was increased (data not shown), main products were always 5&#x02013;12-mer fragments. This result indicates that a certain length of dsDNA is required for the formation of a stable CTD&#x02013;substrate complex.</p><p>All of the detected fragments retained an unreacted 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-terminus, indicating that CTD possesses a non-sequence-specific endonuclease activity rather than exonuclease activity. Gel electrophoretic analysis also ruled out the possibility of 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; exonuclease activity of CTD because there was no observable accumulation of short fragments during the incision of 5&#x02032;-labeled substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We then tested the oligonucleotide analog where the nucleotide at the 3&#x02032;-terminal end was replaced with LNA, which contains an extra 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>, 4&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-methylene bridge on the ribose ring. It had been reported that this substrate shows a tolerance to exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Although the 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of KOD polymerase was affected by the replacement of the 3&#x02032;-terminal end, the replacement did not affect the nuclease activity of CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, electrophoretic analysis also demonstrated that CTD does not possess an exonuclease activity. Thus, we have confirmed the validity of the ESI&#x02013;FT ICR mass spectrometric analysis.

In comparison, the analysis of a sequence- or structure-specific endonuclease activity should be relatively straightforward using this methodology. The information about substrate specificity and the nature of cleaved sites would be a great help in understanding the mechanism of an enzyme and its role in a biological process. For example, when a newly discovered nuclease preferably incised at an abasic site yielding 5&#x02032;-deoxyribosephosphate (5&#x02032;-dRP) end, we should consider the possibility that the nuclease takes part in base excision repair through the repair of abasic sites and the repair pathway requires an enzyme that have a 5&#x02032;-dRPase activity such as DNA polymerase &#x003b2;.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported in part by Grants-in-aid for Scientific Research to R.M. from the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture of Japan and by the RIKEN Structural Genomics/Proteomics Initiative (RSGI), the National Project on Protein Structural and Functional Analyses, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

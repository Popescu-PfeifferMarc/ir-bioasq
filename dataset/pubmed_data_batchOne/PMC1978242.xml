This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of MCE on regulatory mechanisms of cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) involved in immunological activity of Raw264.7 cells. Cells were pretreated with methanolic extracts of MCE, and further cultured for an appropriate time after lipopolyssacharide (LPS) addition. During the entire experimental period, 0.1 and 0.3 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of MCE had no cytotoxicity. In these concentrations, MCE inhibited the production of NO and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>), the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and phosphorylated inhibitor of &#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;), and the activation of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B).

It has been used in oriental medicine to remove heat from the blood, promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Moutan Cortex has been shown to have antimicrobial actions against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, typhoid, paratyphoid bacilli and <italic>Cholera vibrio</italic>, and antihypertensive efficacy including analgesic, sedative and anticonvulsant effects. Moutan Cortex exerts a protective effect against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity by attenuating GSH depletion, cytochrome P450 2E1 activity and hepatic DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and scavenging effects on the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical, superoxide anion radical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), hydroxy radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and intracellular ROS in oxidative condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Lipopolyssacharide (LPS)-activated macrophages have usually been used for evaluating the anti-inflammatory effects of various materials. LPS is a principle component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is an endotoxin that induces septic shock syndrome and stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukins, prostanoids and leukotrienes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Therefore, LPS plays a key role in not only eliciting an inflammatory response but also causing septic shock during a Gram-negative bacterial infection. Inflammatory responses are advantageous for eradicating bacteria, as long as they are under control. However, when out of control, deregulated inflammation leads to the massive production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), which can cause tissue injury and multiple organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Recently, there have been many studies concerning natural products with anti-inflammatory activity, for example, <italic>Polygonum tinctorium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), <italic>Cyperus rotundus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), <italic>Cudrania tricuspidata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), Ginsenoside Rg3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), sauchinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), <italic>curcuma</italic> rhizomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and Farfarae Flos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Although Moutan Cortex has been used as an anti-inflammatory agent in oriental medicine, the mechanisms of anti-iflammatory activity of Moutan Cortex have not been studied scientifically. Paeonol is a major component of Moutan Cortex that may be largely responsible for the therapeutic effect of Moutan Cortex. Paeonol regulated histamine, IgE and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, it is not enough to explain the anti-inflammatory activity of paeonol and Moutan Cortex. There is no evidence to explain the mechanism on the inflammatory cytokine regulation of Moutan Cortex. Including paeonol, there are many known chemical components of Moutan Cortex such as paenoside, paeonolide, paeoniflorin, oxypaeonolniflorin, benzoylpaeoniflorin, benzoyl-oxy-paeoniflorin and apiopaeonoside. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of methanol extract of Moutan Cortex (MCE) on the regulatory mechanism of NO, cytokines and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) in the LPS-activated Raw264.7 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of Methanol Extract of Moutan Cortex</title><p>Moutan Cortex (300 g, Wolsung, Daegu, Korea) was extracted with 1000 ml of methanol at room temperature for 24 h.

It is caused by cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1 and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and by eicosanoid such as PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Thus, inhibitors of these cytokines have been considered as a candidate of an anti-inflammatory drug. Moutan Cortex has been used to diminish inflammation in oriental medicine. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of Moutan Cortex on inflammation. Herbal medicine, keishibukuryogan (Gui-Zhi-Fu-Ling-Wan) containing Moutan Cortex, was reported to decrease disease activity evaluated by levels of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In this study, we show that MCE could modulate the regulatory mechanism of NO, cytokines and PGE<sub>2</sub> in the LPS-activated Raw264.7 cells. MCE inhibited the level of NO, PGE<sub>2</sub>, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, and the expression of iNOS and COX-2 activated by LPS. These inhibitory effects were mediated through the inhibition of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation and NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p>NO is a free radical produced from <sc>l</sc>-arginine by nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), and an important cellular second messenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The modulation of iNOS-mediated NO release is one of the major contributing factors during the inflammatory process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). At adequate concentrations, NO can generate or modify intracellular signals, thereby affecting the function of immune cells, as well as tumor cells and resident cells of different tissues and organs. However, its uncontrolled release can cause inflammatory destruction of target tissue during an infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Moutan Cortex has cytoprotective effects against NO-mediated neuronal cell death in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In our study, MCE reduced the level of iNOS expression in a concentration-dependent manner.</p><p>PGE<sub>2</sub> is generated by the sequential metabolism of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase and it is associated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Cyclooxygenase exists in two isoforms; COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is a constitutively expressed enzyme with general housekeeping function. COX-2 is an inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), and its most important role is in inflammation. Herb medicine containing Moutan Cortex acts as a potent inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Moutan Cortex also showed analgesic effect on the PGF2&#x003b1;-induced allodynia in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). We found that MCE could suppress the induction of COX-2 by LPS, and consequently reduce the production of PGE<sub>2</sub> in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B has been implicated in the expression of iNOS and COX-2 protein. Activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling cascade results in the complete degradation of I-&#x003ba;B via phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Paeonol showed regulatory effects on inflammatory cytokines-related anaphylactic reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), and cerebral disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Recently, paeonol was reported to reduce TNF-&#x003b1;-stimulated iNOS protein and mRNA expression via inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In this study, MCE inhibited the phosphorylation of I-&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and LPS-inducible increase in the band intensity of NF-&#x003ba;B binding. Thus, it seems that anti-inflammatory effect of MCE is partly responsible for paeonol. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of paeonol in LPS-induced macrophage, studies on the effects of paeonol on the mechanism of LPS-induced NO, cytokines and PGE<sub>2</sub> are needed.</p><p>In conclusion, we determined that the MCE can have anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing the phosphorylation of I-&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, and by inhibiting the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-activated Raw264.7 cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Oriental Medicine R&#x00026;D project, Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare, Republic of Korea (B050035-AM0815-05N1-00020B).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>KC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The pharmacology of Chinese herbs</article-title><year>1999</year><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>CRC Press</publisher-name><fpage>403</fpage><lpage>4</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shon</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name><name><surname>Nam</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Protective effect of moutan cortex extract on acetaminophen-induced cytotoxicity in human Chang liver cells</article-title><source>Biol Pharm Bull</source><year>2002</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>1427</fpage><lpage>31</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12419953</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shon</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name><name><surname>Nam</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Protective effect of Moutan Cortex extract on acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice</article-title><source>J Ethnopharmacol</source><year>2004</year><volume>90</volume><fpage>415</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15013210</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yoshikawa</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ohta</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kawaguchi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bioactive constituents of Chinese natural medicines.

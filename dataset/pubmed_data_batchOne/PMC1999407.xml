Recent studies implied that mammalian members of the TRP family, which belong to the TRPV and TRPM subfamilies, are intrinsically voltage-gated channels. However, it is unclear whether the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPs, which belong to the TRPC subfamily, share the same voltage-dependent gating mechanism. Exploring the voltage dependence of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPL expressed in S2 cells, we found that the voltage dependence of this channel is not an intrinsic property since it became linear upon removal of divalent cations. We further found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocked TRPL in a voltage-dependent manner by an open channel block mechanism, which determines the frequency of channel openings and constitutes the sole parameter that underlies its voltage dependence. Whole cell recordings from a <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant expressing only TRPL indicated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> block also accounts for the voltage dependence of the native TRPL channels. The open channel block by Ca<sup>2+</sup> that we characterized is a useful mechanism to improve the signal to noise ratio of the response to intense light when virtually all the large conductance TRPL channels are blocked and only the low conductance TRP channels with lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity are active.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>M.

For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, TRP channels are known to mediate the response to light (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Ranganathan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Scott and Zuker, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Montell, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hardie and Raghu, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Minke and Cook, 2002</xref>) and in mammals they are involved in detections of changes in the environment. TRP channels gate in response to a myriad of stimuli, including cold or hot temperatures, natural chemical compounds (menthol, camphor, and capsaicin), and mechanical stimuli. These channels are crucially involved in physiological processes, e.g., photoreception, pheromone sensing, taste perception, thermosensation, pain perception, mechanosensation, perception of pungent compounds (mustard, garlic), renal Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> handling, smooth muscle tone, and blood pressure regulation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Minke and Cook, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Clapham, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Voets et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Montell, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nilius et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Nilius and Mahieu, 2006</xref>). There are seven TRP subfamilies: TRPC, which includes the founding member of this family, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRP (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Minke et al., 1975</xref>), TRPM, TRPV, TRPN, TRPA, TRPP, and TRPML (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clapham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Montell, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Owsianik et al., 2005</xref>). In spite of the vast interest in these channels, the mechanism underlying stimulus-dependent regulation and gating of TRP channels remains largely unknown (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clapham et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies conducted in heterologous expression systems implied that members of the TRPV and TRPM subfamilies are voltage-gated channels, showing a temperature- and agonist-dependent shift of their voltage dependence (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Voets et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clapham et al., 2005</xref>). It is, however, unclear whether other subfamilies of TRP channels share the same voltage-dependent gating mechanism (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nilius et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor cell is a powerful experimental system, currently being one of the few systems in which two members of the TRPC family, TRP and TRPL, are accessible to whole cell recordings and their physiological functions are well defined in vivo (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Ranganathan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Scott and Zuker, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Montell, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hardie and Raghu, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Minke and Cook, 2002</xref>). However, the photoreceptor cells are not accessible to single channel recordings of the native TRP and TRPL channels (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hardie, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Ranganathan et al., 1991</xref>). Often, channels expressed in heterologous systems differ in their properties from in vivo channels (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Minke and Parnas, 2006</xref>). This, however, is not the case for the expressed TRPL channels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, as they show similar properties to the native channel (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hardie et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, results obtained in S2 cells expressing TRPL channels, which allows single channel analysis (see below), can be verified and provide physiological insight to the native system.</p><p>In the present study we explored the voltage dependence of expressed <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPL channels and show that it is not an intrinsic property of the channels, but arises from voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> open channel block. A mathematical model constructed from experimental observations describing channel&#x02013;Ca<sup>2+</sup> interaction indicated that it is the dissociation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the open channel that underlies the voltage dependence of the channel. Whole cell recordings from a <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant expressing the native TRPL channels indicated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> block also accounts for the voltage dependence of the native TRPL channels in the photoreceptor cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Fly Stocks</title><p>White-eyed <italic>trp<sup>P343</sup></italic> null mutants were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Light Stimulation</title><p>A xenon high-pressure lamp (PTI, LPS 220, operating at 50 W) was used, and the light stimuli were delivered to the ommatidia by means of epi-illumination via an objective lens (in situ).

Whole-cell and single-channel currents are recorded at room temperature using borosilicate patch pipettes of 5&#x02013;8 M&#x003a9; and an Axopatch 1D (Axon Instruments, Inc.) voltage-clamp amplifier. For single channel recordings, pipettes were coated with Dow Corning sylgard. For S2 cells, voltage-clamp pulses were generated and data were captured using a Digidata 1322A interfaced to a computer running the pClamp 9.2 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). For <italic>Drosophila</italic> ommatidia, Digidata 1200 and pClamp 8.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.) were used. Currents were filtered using the 8-pole low pass Bessel filter of the patch-clamp amplifier at 10 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz (single channel recordings) or filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz (whole cell recordings). To measure I-V curves with minimal distortions, only cells with low (&#x0003c;10 M&#x003a9;) series resistance were used and the series resistance was compensated to &#x0223c;80%.</p></sec><sec><title>Solutions</title><p>The details of the solutions are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">II</xref>.

Consistent with the cell-attached data, whole cell recordings showed that cells expressing TRPL displayed outwardly rectifying I-V curves (using voltage ramps from &#x02212;150 to 150 mV in 1 s) when exposed to extracellular solutions containing either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, green and black curves, respectively). Removal of divalent cations from the extracellular solution resulted in an increase of inward current but did not cause a full linearization of the I-V curve (pink curve). When both intracellular and extracellular solutions were divalent free, the channels exhibited a linearization of the I-V curve (blue curve, <italic>n</italic> = 11). The outward rectification of the I-V curve could be restored upon application of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Ba<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, green and black curves, respectively). It can be argued that in the absence of divalent cations, the membrane becomes fragile and gives rise to a large leak current, which underlies the linear I-V curve. This possibility was ruled out by the following observations. First, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> shows that the divalent free solution affected only the currents at the negative membrane potentials (from &#x02212;200 pA to approximately &#x02212;2,000 pA), while at positive membrane potentials the currents remained virtually the same. Second, the reversal potential during divalent-free solution was &#x0223c;15 mV and not zero as expected from leak current, consistent with the reversal potential of intracellular Cs<sup>+</sup> solution and extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> solution. Third, after establishing a linear I-V curve, we applied either Ca<sup>2+</sup>- or Ba<sup>2+</sup>-containing solutions, and the outward rectification was reestablished (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Divalent block underlies the outward rectification of the TRPL channel.

Excised inside-out patches with pipettes containing divalent-free solution revealed that patches exposed to divalent-containing solution at the intracellular side showed no channel activity at the negative membrane potential and a significant activity at the positive membrane potential (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, left). Membrane patches exposed to divalent-free solution showed similar channel activity at both negative and positive membrane potentials (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, right). Ca<sup>2+</sup> exerted a more profound inhibition from the intracellular side relative to the extracellular side. This conclusion was derived from the complete inhibition of channel activity even at positive membrane potentials in excised inside out patches when exposed to 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), while significant current was still observed in whole cell recordings in the presence of the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the extracellular solution.</p><p>Several mechanisms could account for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent outward rectification of the TRPL channel. To determine if divalent cations could affect single channel conductance in a voltage-dependent manner, we examined the effect of membrane potential on various channel parameters in the presence of divalent cations. To measure the single channel conductance, we applied voltage ramps (from &#x02212;150 to 150 mV in 1 s) in an excised inside out membrane patch that contained only few channels. The low frequency of channel activity at negative membrane potentials (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) made it difficult to obtain an I-V curve of single channel open conductance at negative membrane potentials. To overcome this difficulty we used superimposed current traces during voltage ramps from the same cell. In some cells after application of many voltag ramps, the frequency of channel openings increased spontaneously, showing many channel openings at negative membrane potentials, while at positive membrane potentials, the channel was virtually constantly open and relatively small closing events were observed. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> presents an example of such recording. The straight line is a linear regression curve fitting only the long channel openings. This curve also fits superimposed current traces of voltage ramps from the same cell before the enhanced channel activity was developed. A linear I-V curve of the open state of the channel was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, gray line). A single channel conductance of 110 pS (<italic>n</italic> = 5) was measured (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> inset), which is similar to that obtained in a previous systematic study (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zimmer et al., 2000</xref>), but differs from earlier reports by about a factor of 2 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hardie et al., 1997</xref>). This discrepancy most likely arose from the different method used to calculate single channel conductance in the latter study. <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hardie et al. (1997)</xref> mainly used noise analysis from whole cell recordings, which usually gives a rough estimate of the actual single channel conductance. Indeed, several studies in which the single channel conductance of the expressed TRPL channel was determined directly from single channel analysis revealed single channel conductance very similar to that obtained in the present study, although different expression cell systems were used (i.e., COS, HEK, and Sf9 cells; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Obukhov et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kunze et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hambrecht et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Voltage dependence of the open probability of the TRPL channel underlies its outward rectification (the solutions used in this figure are 2 and 5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">II</xref>).

The voltage dependency of P<sub>o</sub> could result from the effect of voltage on the number of channel openings (opening frequency) or from the effect on the mean open time. The results of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> revealed that voltage affected the opening frequency. In particular, the channel opening frequency increases as depolarization increases (the number of channel openings at &#x02212;150 mV is only 5% of that at 150 mV).

The observation that two exponents are required to best fit the open time histogram (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) suggests that two open states of long and short open time exist, though only a single conductance characterizes both (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

Given the strong inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on channel openings, (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) we investigated whether the mean open time is Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent.

The results of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref> further indicate that only the long open state is susceptible to open channel block, presumably because the short open state is too short to allow a Ca<sup>2+</sup> block (see model insights in the online supplemental material, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200609659/DC1">http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200609659/DC1</ext-link>).

This feature is a prominent characteristic of TRP channels in general (e.g., <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2004</xref>). Bursting behavior of a channel is known to arise from fast transitions of the channel between a conducting (open state) and nonconducting closed or blocked states (see model in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The observation that two exponents are needed to best fit the open time histogram (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) already suggested that two open states of long and short open times exist, though only a single conductance characterizes both (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). To show that the two open states also exist in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solutions where block is not expected, we constructed an open time histogram under these conditions, and two exponents were also needed to fit best the histogram (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and E</xref>). At least three closed states of the channel must be assumed to account for the bursting behavior of the channel, in which two distinct burst types were observed that differed in the mean open (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) and closed times within the bursts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>).</p><p>The model calculations tested the main issues of this work, namely the mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocks the channel. To accommodate the model to the result showing that the mean open time is strongly reduced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>) we assumed in the model calculations that Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocked the open channel (open channel block) and that depolarization relieved the channel from that block. Given that the TRPL channel has two open states, the results of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref> suggested that only the long open state was susceptible to open channel block. Accordingly, a blocked state (B<sub>2</sub>) was introduced into the model after the long open state (O<sub>L</sub>). Since it was reasonable to assume that two open states with the same conductance share the same blocking properties, we added a blocked state (B<sub>1</sub>) to the short open state (O<sub>S</sub>) as well (see model insights below). Since <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> demonstrated that the divalent ion block occurs from both sides of the membrane (see also <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hille, 1992</xref>) we set no limitation on the direction of divalent cation entry to the channel.</p><p>The result of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> clearly showed that the TRPL channel exhibits voltage dependence in the presence of divalent cations. This result suggests that either entry of the channel or its exit from the blocked state is voltage dependent. To distinguish between these two possibilities we measured the mean closed time within the burst as a function of membrane voltage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref> shows that the mean closed time becomes shorter at depolarizing voltage, indicating that k<sub>-b</sub> (the rate constant of exit from the blocked state) is voltage dependent. This conclusion was strongly supported by the model calculations as explained in model insights (supplemental text and Fig. S1). The model parameters that are listed in Table S3 were derived from direct experimental measurements (supplement) and account for all the above arguments.</p></sec><sec><title>Burst Duration and the Number of Channel Openings in a Burst Are Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Voltage Dependent</title><p>A powerful way to explore the properties of the TRPL channel in general and the nature of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> block in particular is to analyze the channel bursting behavior and its apparent voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence. Bursts are fast transitions of the channel between the open and the adjacent closed states. Thus, parameters that affect the burst, affect the open state. We therefore investigated burst properties with and without divalent cations at various membrane potentials. The design of these experiments was based on model predictions. Importantly, burst duration and the number of openings within the burst were independent of membrane potential in divalent free conditions when no block was expected, as predicted by the model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, right). In contrast, in the presence of divalent cations, an increase in membrane potential markedly increased the number of openings within the burst and consequently burst duration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, left). Furthermore, at negative membrane potential there were fewer events in the burst in the presence of divalent cations, and the burst duration became shorter relative to its duration in divalent-free condition, indicating that the blocked state terminates the burst. We consistently found that the criterion for burst definition (i.e., the time interval between channel openings within the burst) did not affect the conclusion that burst duration is strongly dependent on membrane potential in the presence of divalent cations (unpublished data). In the presence of divalent cations at positive membrane voltage, the number of events in the burst increased relative to divalent-free conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>), indicating a stabilizing effect of the divalent cations on the burst.

<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"/> demonstrated that removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> block by positive voltage activated the TRPL channels by increasing the frequency of channel openings. Furthermore, the predictions of the kinetic model and TRPL channel bursting behavior indicated that voltage-dependent increase of the dissociation rate constant of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the blocked state underlies TRPL openings at positive membrane potential. Can open channel block by divalent cations, found in the expressed TRPL channels, also account for the voltage dependence of the native TRPL of the photoreceptor cells?</p><p>Before answering this question it is useful to outline several properties of the native versus the expressed TRPL channel and to address some of the problems involved in studying the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the channels in the native photoreceptor cell. In the native system, the TRPL channel can be studied separately without the effects of the highly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable TRP channel, by using the <italic>trp<sup>P343</sup></italic> null mutant, which expresses only the TRPL channels (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 1997</xref>). Although the characteristics of the native and expressed TRPL channel are similar, activation of the channel in the two systems is very different: Heterologously expressed TRPL channels in S2 cells are constitutively active (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hardie et al., 1997</xref>), while the native channels show their properties only during activation by light (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hardie and Minke, 1994b</xref>) or by metabolic stress (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hardie and Minke, 1994b</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Agam et al., 2000</xref>; see below). Moreover, it is difficult to isolate the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the native TRPL from its effects on the phospholipase C&#x003b2; (PLC), which activates TRPL, and its activity is strongly Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Berstein et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hardie et al., 2001</xref>). In wild-type fly, the major fraction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable TRP channel. The <italic>trp</italic> mutant, which expresses only TRPL channels, responds to sustained light transiently, revealing response inactivation due to an insufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx for normal PLC activity during prolonged lights (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hardie et al., 2001</xref>). This response inactivation is the hallmark of the <italic>trp</italic> mutant phenotype (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cook and Minke, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Long incubation of the photoreceptor cells in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium is required to obtain total removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from the cytosol of these cells, due to their highly compartmentalized structure. However, prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> deprivation abolishes light activation of the native channels (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cook and Minke, 1999</xref>; see also <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Agam et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we could examine the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution for limited times only. We examined the effect of reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels on the I-V curve of the native TRPL channels either during shorts illuminations (1 s), or after metabolic exhaustion. Metabolic exhaustion induced TRPL channel openings in the dark after removal of ATP and GTP from the recording pipette. In both methods of channel activation, the magnitude of TRPL channel openings declined slowly (&#x0223c;1 min) with time, and therefore, I-V curves were measured at maximal channel activity. When the extracellular solution contained 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, virtually no inward current was observed at negative membrane potentials (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, blue curves). In contrast, when no divalent cations were added to the extracellular solution (Low divalent), &#x0223c;1&#x02013;2 nA inward current develops at &#x02212;60 mV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, black). Further reduction of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level by adding EDTA (5 mM) to the intracellular and extracellular solutions resulted in &#x0003e;5 nA inward currents at &#x02212;60 mV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, red curves). Importantly, the I-V curves measured after metabolic stress (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>) or light activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>) revealed similar dependence on Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocks the TRPL channel independent of the method of TRPL activation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Open channel block by Ca<sup>+2</sup> underlies the voltage dependence of the native TRPL channel.

This possibility was ruled out by the following observations. First, after the cessation of the light stimulus in divalent-free conditions, the dramatic increase of both inward and outward currents during light was strongly suppressed, returning to the original small leak current in the dark (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, green). Second, channel activation by metabolic stress is characterized by a transient increase in conductance (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hardie and Minke, 1994b</xref>). In divalent-free conditions after a nearly linear I-V curve was observed, the activated channels closed spontaneously and the current was reduced to a relatively small leak current (unpublished data). Together, these observations indicate that the near linearization of the I-V curve at divalent-free conditions is not the result of an increase in nonspecific leakage through the plasma membrane but a specific effect on the TRPL channels.</p><p>To quantitate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent block of the inward current relative to the magnitude of the outward current, we calculated the ratio between the inward and outward currents at &#x02212;60 and 60 mV membrane voltages, respectively, at different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). The small insignificant difference between the calculated ratio at 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and low divalent is consistent with the high affinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the TRPL channel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Importantly, the calculated ratio at divalent-free conditions is about twofold larger than under low divalent conditions, reflecting the almost linearity of the I-V curve (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, red). Together, the study of the native TRPL channels indicates that their voltage dependence is not an intrinsic property but arises from Ca<sup>2+</sup> block (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Open Channel Block by Ca<sup>2+</sup> Underlies the Voltage Dependence of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPL Channel</title><p>In the present study, the mechanism underlying the voltage dependence of the TRPL channel was investigated for the first time. The detailed analyses of single channel and whole cell currents indicated that the voltage dependence of the TRPL channel is not an intrinsic property but arises from open channel block by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The ability to robustly activate these channels at physiologically relevant negative membrane potentials by reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels was manifested by the appearance of a large inward current in the expressed and native TRPL channels. Previous reports showed only outward rectification of the TRPL channels (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chyb et al., 1999</xref>). However, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> show that both the expressed and native TRPL channels revealed a pronounced conductance also at negative membrane potential in Ca<sup>2+</sup> free conditions, which can be blocked by the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on both sides of the plasma membrane. This observation fits well with notion of voltage-dependent block by a permeable charged blocking agent that permeates the channel from both outside and inside the channel, while only depolarization can relieve this block (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hille, 1992</xref>; see also <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Seifert et al., 1999</xref>). Enhanced channel openings at positive membrane potential of TRPL in the presence of divalent cations is fully consistent with the notion that Ca<sup>2+</sup> open channel block underlies the outward rectification of these channels, because depolarization removes Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel block. Similarly, channel openings at negative membrane potential in divalent-free conditions, when this block is reduced, support the above notion. The voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> block of the native TRPL channel (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) is reminiscent of a very similar property of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, which was studied in great detail by Kaupp and colleagues (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Seifert et al., 1999</xref>). This voltage-dependent blockage of the open channel is characteristic of positively charged, permeable channel blocker, where blockage efficacy increases when the membrane voltage is made less positive because access of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the blocking site in the channel lumen is facilitated (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Seifert et al., 1999</xref>). The close similarity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> open channel block phenomenon between the TRPL channel and the thoroughly investigated CNG channels strongly supports the notion that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocks the native TRPL channel by an open channel block mechanism.</p><p>Although the TRPL channel is a calmodulin (CaM) binding protein (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 1997</xref>), the blocking effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the channel most likely did not involve CaM because the blocking effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was also found after application of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup>. This conclusion is supported by the findings of Flockerzi and colleagues who found that TRPL channel block by Ca<sup>2+</sup> was not affected by calmidazolium, a known blocker of CaM and suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocks the TRPL channel directly (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zimmer et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The difference in the mechanism underlying the voltage dependence of TRPC channels (i.e., TRPL) and the intrinsic voltage dependence of TRPV and TRPM channels (i.e., TRPV1 and TRPM8; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Owsianik et al., 2005</xref>) may arise from the difference in the amino acid sequence at the pore region between the TRPC and TRPV&#x00026;TRPM channels, which allows open channel block by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in TRPL channels but not in TRPV channels (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Owsianik et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, the gating mechanism of the TRPL channel does not involve activation by voltage changes as suggested for TRPV and TRPM channels.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological Implications of TRPL Channel Block by Ca<sup>2plus;</sup>
</title><p>The photoreceptor cell has two functional light-activated channels, TRP and TRPL. The TRP channels have a small (&#x0223c;4 pS) conductance (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hardie and Minke, 1994b</xref>), while the TRPL channels have much larger conductance of 110 pS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The TRPL channels contribute &#x0223c;40% to the total light-induced current in dark-adapted flies in response to dim or medium intensity lights (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bahner et al., 2002</xref>). At medium light intensities, the LIC is a sum of the current flow through both the TRP and TRPL channels (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Reuss et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bahner et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, during intense light, the LIC of WT flies is very similar to that of the <italic>trpl</italic> mutant (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Niemeyer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al., 2000</xref>), indicating that the TRPL channels are inactive. This observation is readily explained by the higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of the TRPL channels relative to the TRP channels (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hardie and Minke, 1994a</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Reuss et al., 1997</xref>). (The lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of the TRP relative to the TRPL channel is clearly reflected in I-V curves measured at nominal external Ca<sup>2+</sup> [&#x0223c;10 &#x003bc;M external Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the relevant mutants. While the I-V curve of the <italic>trp</italic> mutant shows strong outward rectification and minimal inward current at nominal external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the <italic>trpl</italic> mutant [or WT flies] shows a strong inward and outward rectification at the same external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hardie and Minke, 1994a</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Reuss et al., 1997</xref>].) Since the TRPL channel has large single channel conductance, it greatly contributes to the noise of the LIC (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Reuss et al., 1997</xref>). It is therefore expected, according to an open channel block mechanism, that at intense light, when all TRPL channels are blocked, the noise level will be reduced. In contrast, at medium light intensities, when a large fraction of the TRPL channels is still available for light activation, the noise level will be higher. Indeed, the study of Hardie and colleagues (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Reuss et al., 1997</xref>) shows that the noise level of the LIC induced by medium intensity light is significantly larger in WT than in the <italic>trpl</italic> mutant (with no TRPL channels). Taken together, the signal to noise ratio of the light response is improved during intense light by Ca<sup>2+</sup> open channel block of the TRPL channel.</p><p>It is interesting to note that divalent open channel block that largely reduces the single channel conductance is a property of CNG channels of vertebrate photoreceptors, indicating that divalent open channel block is a general strategy of increasing the signal to noise ratio of photoreceptor cells in the animal kingdom (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gray and Attwell, 1985</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="PMC_1"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgenphysiol_jgp.200609659_index.html" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1822" position="anchor"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jgenphysiol_jgp.200609659_1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1823" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.

      "{'pmid': '22529673', 'title': 'Pharmacognostical and physicochemical analysis of Tamarindus indica Linn. stem', 'body': 'INTRODUCTION Tamarind is one of the major culinary articles obtained from Tamarindus indica Linn. belonging to Caesalpinaceae subfamily of Fabaceae family. The tree is a long-lived, large, evergreen or semi-evergreen tree, 20–30 m tall with a thick trunk up to 1.5–2 m across and up to 8 m in circumference. The trunk forks at about 1 m above ground and is often multistemmed with branches widely spreading, drooping at the ends and often crooked but forming a spreading, rounded crown. The bark is brownish-gray, rough, and scaly. Young twigs are slender and puberulent. A dark red gum exudes from the trunk and branches when they are damaged.[1 ] India is a major producer and consumer of Tamarind in the world.[2 ] Along with culinary usage, there is a vast medicinal utility of T. indica L. described which are enumerated in different Ayurvedic classics. Besides fruit being an important part, the Kasta (wood) is another part used specially for the purpose of Kshara (alkaline extract) preparation. Tamarind, commonly called as Imli in Hindi, which is known as Chincha in Ayurveda is a Kshara tree categorized under Ksharastaka (eight kshara plants).[3 ] Chincha kshara is an independent medicine, and is also used as an ingredient in formulations such as Shankha Vati ,[4 ] Mahashankha Vati s,[5 ] Agnisandeepano Rasa ,[6 ] Gudapippali ,[7 ] Bhruhat Gudapippali ,[8 ] and Shankhadravaka rasa [9 ] etc. Even though entire plant is generally recommended for the purpose of kshara preparation, indicating that any part of the plant is suitable for it, the Rasashastra text Rasa Tarangini advocates Kasta (wood) as the usable part for the preparation of Kshara .[10 ] MATERIALS AND METHODS The stem of T. indica L. was collected from Udupi, Karnataka (India) and was authenticated in Pharmacognosy Laboratory, IPGT and RA, Jamnagar. (Voucher specimen: Phm No. 6009) Macroscopic and Organoleptic evaluation of the specimens was done.[11 ] For Microscopic evaluation, thin transverse hand sections of stem including its well developed heartwood were taken and studied under distilled water to observe crystals of calcium oxalate, starch, etc. The sections were then stained with Phloroglucinol and Conc. HCl to study lignified tissues. Microphotographs were taken using Carlzeiss Microscope.[12 ] Shade-dried powder of the stem including heartwood was used for physicochemical evaluation as per standard methods.[13 ] The ash value represents the inorganic salts present in the drug.[14 ] Extracts obtained by exhausting crude drugs are indicative of approximate measures of certain chemical compounds, thus representing the quality and purity of the drug.[15 ] Stem powder was subjected to powder microscopy, and microphotographs were taken.[16 ] For fluorescence analysis, the powdered drug was treated with different reagents and was observed for fluorescence under UV light.[17 ] RESULTS Macroscopically the stem was about 26 mm thick. Hard and uneven outer surface was reddish brown and marked by silvery gray lichen deposits. Thickness of outer stem bark was 2 mm. The inner surface was smooth and cream colored. Thick, hard and well developed heartwood was enclosed in the bark. The Organoleptic characters were as depicted in Table 1 . Table 1 Organoleptic characters Microscopic characters Transverse section of stem shows outer bark, containing light brown-colored outer most layer, the cork. The cork composed of three to five zones of slight thick-walled cells alternating with narrower zones of thin-walled cells. Most of the cells are filled with reddish brown-colored contents, followed by phelloderm, parenchymatous layer in which large groups of stone cells are present. The stone cell groups are mostly large, and there are many thick-walled cells of varied size in each group. The inner most zone of bark contains phloem. The region between stone cell layer and inner most zone contains many small rounded stone cells, small size fiber groups, and compressed parenchymatous tissue present along with small thin-walled parenchyma cell. In this region, groups of fiber cells are arranged. A few parenchyma cells adjacent to the fiber groups contain small crystals of calcium oxalate. The medullary ray cells are radially elongated and thin walled at the inner region of the phloem. Gradually, cells become widen and elongated toward the distal end of the ray. At the dilated end of the rays, some of the rays are found to contain crystals of calcium oxalate. Transverse section of matured stem including centrally situated heartwood shows alternative bands of xylem and lignified fibers due to the secondary growth of the stem; lignified fibers and the xylem vessels are continuously bounded with medullary rays. Medullary rays are usually biseriate to triseriate. Xylem is surrounded by xylem parenchyma, and some of the xylem vessels are filled with oleoresin, wax, and gum-forming tylosis [Figure 1 ].

Table 2 Physicochemical analysis Thin layer chromatography Reference regarding the solvent system for the TLC is not found in the available literature. On multiple trial and error basis, toluene: ethyl acetate (8:2) was found to be suitable for T. indica L. stem including heartwood. Methanolic extract of stem powder was subjected for the analysis. The results obtained from TLC are depicted in Table 3 . Table 3 TLC analysis of methanolic extract of stem powder of T. indica L Ultraviolet fluorescence The observations are presented in Table 4 . Table 4 Ultraviolet analysis of stem powder of T. indica L DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The pharmacognostical and physicochemical analysis of stem including heartwood of T. indica L. provides substantial information for the proper identification, authentification, and scientific evaluation of the drug. Transverse section of stem showing phelloderm, stone cells layer, fiber groups, calcium oxalate, and crystal fibers are important unique characters found in this apart from tylosis from heartwood region. It can be noted that the tylosis may play a very important role in formation of chemical constituents such as tannin. As tamarind bark is reported to be rich with tannin contents,[18 ] methanol-soluble extractive was used for TLC and anisaldehyde H2 SO4 was used for spraying in the latter stage.[19 ] There were four spots found, observed under UV long wave and after the spray of anisaldehyde H2 SO4 , five spots were observed under day light. Result of loss on drying indicates that at 105°C, 5.37% of the stem material was volatile. Total ash indicates that the drug taken has 4.5% of inorganic material in it. Only 6.6% of the drug material was found to be soluble in water and 7.3% was in methanol. The pH being 6.31 indicates that the drug taken was slightly acidic in nature.'}\n"
